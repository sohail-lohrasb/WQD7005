A brand new one from the local Mercedes-Benz dealership would cost around RM1.7mil.A brand new Toyota Alphard 3.5 from UMW Toyota would be around RM443,000. A similar model from reconditioned sellers, which are said to be brand new, are priced at around RM400,000.The open AP policy has always been a controversial topic, ever since the issue erupted in 2005 that it only benefitted certain companies.It was of course, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad who raised the issue, two years after retiring from his first tenure as prime minister.He had claimed that the policy made certain individuals wealthier and that its large issuance led to unfair competition against Proton. The controversy had then caused a fallout between Dr Mahathir and Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz, who was the International Trade and Industry (Miti) Minister for 21 years, 15 of which were under Dr Mahathir’s administration.Just three days ago, Miti announced the implementation of its new open AP policy, which will now see no limit to the overall number of open APs to be released throughout the year."

For instance, supplies to China in January rose 34% year on year to 1.4 million b/d, official government data showed.But, an open arbitrage to Asia for US, North Sea and West African crudes, and the possibility of a potential thaw in US-China trade tensions, increasingly threatens the kingdom’s carefully crafted strategy.

The kingdom cut output to 10.15 million b/d in February, according to an S&P Global Platts survey.That was 160,000 b/d below its quota of 10.31 million b/d and the lowest level since May 2018.

Or was the new management taking a cautious stance in light of the tough investing environment and adopting an aggressive impairment policy for some of its assets such as Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAS)?First the facts. On Tuesday, Khazanah revealed that it reported a loss of RM6.3bil for 2018, only the second time the fund has slipped into the red. The losses were due to a RM7.3bil impairment made by Khazanah, which is now headed by a new managing director and board.Roughly half of those impairments came from MAS alone.So the question is, why the impairment in MAS of more than RM3bil?Related story:To save or not to save MAS?"

Interestingly, among the property development companies, Paramount’s share price has done quite well, increasing more than 50% over the last three years.Over that same period, property developers such as SP Setia Bhd  fell 14%, Mah Sing Group Bhd  declined by 26.3%, UEM Sunrise Bhd  fell 25%, Eastern and Oriental Bhd  plunged 42%, while Eco World Development Group Bhd   and MCT Bhd fell 34% and 48%, respectively.In a nutshell, property developers are facing a supply glut of residential properties. According to the Valuation and Property Services Department’s (JPPH) unsold completed residential units rose to 30,115 units as at Sept 30, 2018, an increase of 48.35% from the 20,304 units a year ago. JPPH’s latest figures show that the total value of unsold units was RM19.54bil, a 56.44% rise from RM12.49bil a year ago. Should serviced apartments and small offices home offices (SoHos) be included, the overhang value will rise to 40,916 units, valued at RM27.38bil.As for Paramount, it should be noted that despite its 50% price appreciation, Paramount’s shares are trading at an undemanding price earnings ratio (PE) of 9.5 times. So is there any more upside considering that this value is lower than many other property developers today? For one, Paramount’s property sales have been slowly increasing every year, despite the softening of the property market. RHB Research also notes that about 70% to 80% of most of Paramounts property launches are sold.  For another, Paramount has been selling some of its assets including buildings and lands that had free up some cash and paying bumper dividends. In 2017, the firm sold its Sri KDU Campus in Petaling Jaya for RM165mil to unlisted Alpha REIT (real estate investment trust), which led to Paramount dishing out a bumper dividend of 16 sen per share which at that time gave shareholders a 9% yield.It is worth noting that excluding bumper dividend payment in 2017, Paramount has has been giving dividends yielding between 4%-6% annually, on a payout policy of 40% to 50%."

But it may not have that much time to celebrate.The domestic economy is continuing to slow down. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth stood at 6.2% in the third quarter of 2017 but shrank to 4.7% in the fourth quarter. The economy is projected to grow by only 4.9% in 2019. Hence, the government is facing criticism from some quarters that include calls for the government to deliver comprehensive reforms and better national economic management. Many also see a lack of any catalysts for investors to get excited about Malaysia.The rising cost of living and the low-wage environment are the other key concerns among the people.To its credit, the Pakatan government is going full-force to address various uncertainties and concerns in the market, raise investor confidence and fulfil its election promises.Speaking with StarBizWeek, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng’s political secretary Tony Pua says the government is putting in place various measures to strengthen the national economy.“We are actively meeting the investors and their concerns have definitely reduced. They were generally underweight before the change in government, but are now more neutral.“Concerns over a potential downgrade have also been addressed. The rating agencies understand and accept our justifications and fiscal direction, hence their stable outlook on the country,” he says.Echoing a similar view, TA Securities head of research Kaladher Govindan says investors are more confident with the reforms and the level of transparency. He adds that political uncertainty appears to have fizzled out, to a large extent.“The only concern now is what happens after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad leaves. But that is a long-term issue.“The investors want to see efforts in undertaking the reforms, and improving governance and transparency in numbers. The confidence must translate to numbers such as corporate earnings and foreign direct investment,” says Kaladher.Pua, who is also the Damansara MP, assures that the government has “enough room” to support the economy despite the country’s RM1 trillion debt position, in the event of any economic crisis ahead.He points out that the Finance Minister had announced that the collection from the sales and service tax had exceeded the Finance Ministry’s earlier target for 2018.Related story:Weakening regional outlook"

Firstly, Petronas CEO Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin expects capital expenditure (capex) to increase to above RM50bil in 2019 from RM46.8bil last year.“In the last few years, we have increased our investments in the downstream portfolio. A lot of capital was allocated for the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC). “With PIC now coming to an end, the upstream segment will have its fair share of the capex going forward,” says Wan Zulkiflee. When probed on whether there would be a spike in Malaysian contract awards, seeing that 2018 had seen a 54% jump to RM11.6bil, He declined to give a specific figure“I want to emphasise that how we plan our investments is based on how we project oil prices to be in the future. Many of our projects will take years to complete and before the product is ready and comes onstream. “However I can give you some numbers. Last year, the number of rigs in Malaysian waters was about 15. (It varies from month to month). This year it will be in the mid-20s or higher, and that is a good proxy of the work activities that we are planning,” he says. Now should this be the case, it would indicate that there is some growth in the industry. For some context, Petronas had some 39 rigs in operation in 2014, and this reduced dramatically to 14 in 2015, in line with the depressed market."

Last month, a tender bid was called for two buildings (Annexe 1 and Annexe 2) at its headquarters and the reserve price range is said to be between RM273mil and RM312mil.
TM has various plots of land and buildings around the country, including in Hong Kong. The net book value of all its buildings and land as per its 2017 annual report is estimated at RM2.9bil. Part of the land belongs to the Federal Government.
“We are looking at various options to unlock the value of the buildings and land as we optimise our network. We have been doing this over the past few years,’’  TM acting group chief executive officer/chief operating office Imri Mokhtar said.
But TM will not sell until it gets “good value for its assets.’’
“The proceeds from the sale will be used to fund our business and for our working capital,’’ he said.
Imri was appointed acting CEO in November. Previously, he was head of Unifi for over four years.
Since taking on the new job, he has come up with a new three-year business plan (2019-2021) to chart a new direction for the telco.
He believes TM needs to be transformed into a more agile  organisation in order to capitalise on opportunities. This is necessary with the changing demands of consumers in a converged and digital space.
“There are a lot of things we can improve on, and a lot of areas we can be better in,’’ he said.
Last year was a tough year for TM. It saw the departure of two CEOs and a chairman. Wholesale access pricing was reduced, broadband packages revised lower and competition intensified. 
That will have an impact on TM’s earnings and one criticism is that it has been complacent for far too long.
Its share price suffered and the stock was dropped off the 30-stock benchmark FBM KLCI index.
Imri believes his new plan will create a “new TM’’ that will emerge stronger and able to withstand competition better.
“The transformation reinforces customer centricity. It is timely and much needed. It will be anchored on the customer. We have to recognise that the customer is our number one priority and we need to work on that,’’  he said in a media briefing recently.
There are six pillars to his new plan and they include expansion of infrastructure, bringing to market more simple products and processes, sweating the assets further, optimising cost and efficiencies, and changing the mind-set of the employees to focus on the customer.
“The big game changer will be people development. This is the fuel of our new TM plan. We need to remain relevant and be in sync with consumer demand,’’ he adds.
Imri believes there are plenty of opportunities in the broadband and enterprise market space. It is about tailoring its products to suit customer’s needs.
Unifi is TM’s flagship product and it serves 2.5 million homes currently. It is working to migrate more TMStreamyx users to Unifi. It is also working towards addressing copper wire connections. It wants to work with other mobile players to expand its mobile offering.
“We are open to partnering other players to reduce infrastructure duplication,’’ he adds.
TM plans to spend 18% to 20% of its revenue on capital expenditure to enhance connectivity and digital infrastructure.
He hopes this year would be better financially, though his guidance is “low to single digit decline in revenue, but EBIT to be higher than last year.’’
TM posted a 83.5% decline in net profit to RM153.1mil for full year 2018. This was due to a RM982.5mil provision made for the impairment of fixed and wireless network assets. Revenue was at RM11.8bil.
Analysts do expect more provisioning this year for its telco assets. For 2019, revenue is expected at RM11.4bil and net income at RM604mil as per Bloomberg consensus estimates. A total of 15 research houses have a “hold’’ call on the stock, three a “buy” and nine a “sell,’’ with a target price RM2.88 a share. The stock closed at RM3.18 on Friday.
Public Investment Bank believes that TM retail segment would be affected by a more substantial decline in average revenue per user (ARPU).
“We assume a 15% decline in Unifi ARPU to RM163 in FY19F, compared with only a 4% drop in FY18. Overall, we estimate FY19F revenue to fall by 7% mainly due to lower data and Internet revenue.’’"

It also helped many big-company CEOs secure another raise and total compensation worth $1 million a month.Median compensation for 132 chief executives of S&P 500 companies reached $12.4 million in 2018, up from $11.7 million for the same group in 2017, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The gains were driven by robust corporate profits and strong stock market returns for much of the year.Most of these CEOs received substantial raises—the median was 6.4%—even though the December stock-market swoon meant most of the companies finished out the year posting sluggish shareholder returns.The strong economy, coupled with concern that a slowdown could be lurking in the wings, likely emboldened many boards to boost pay in 2018, said Robin Ferracone, founder of Farient Advisors, an executive-pay consulting firm.“Markets did pretty well, companies did well, and the economy held up,” Ms. Ferracone said. “My sense is that they know right now it’s good, they can justify it with pay for performance, and they know they’re going to have to bring it down when the bloom’s off the rose.”"

MMHE said on Monday its major subdiary Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd (MMHE Sdn Bhd) had received a notice of arbitration dated March 13 from KPOC.

The first contract was for the fabrication of the topsides for the Kebabangan field, about 135km northwest of Kimanis, Sabah betweem KPOC and Sime Darby Enginering Sdn Bhd. The contract was dated Sept 20, 2011.

The second was a novation agreement in relation to a contract, dated March 30, 2012 between KPOC, Sime Darby Engineering and MMHE's unit.

MMHE said the the Kebabangan platform was developed as a hub for development of deepwater oil and gas assets in the North Sabah area.

MMHE Sdn Bhd was responsible to carry out and complete certain works for KPOC, including to construct, engineer, procure, fabricate, inspect, test & pre-commission, load-out and sea-fastening of the Kebabangan topsides and associated appurtenances. The works were completed in June 2014.

However, KPOC, in its notice of arbitration, claimed MMHE Sdn Bhd was and is in breach of the contracts due to the supply of certain valves.
 
“KPOC has included an indicative amount of its alleged loss as part of the notice of arbitration, at about RM125.1mil, and has claimed that it continues to allegedly suffer losses,” it said.
 
MMHE said the expected loss, if any, arising from this claim would be about RM125.1mil million, or more. However, no operational impact is expected to arise from the claim.

“MMHE will vigorously defend the claims made by KPOC and is presently exploring its options to pursue a counterclaim against KPOC,” it said.

“Apart from the arbitration proceeding, MMHE reserves its right to pursue any other legal actions as may be permitted under the Malaysian laws, including, if appropriate, to seek indemnity from the ultimate supplier of the said valves.”"

The Inland Revenue Board said on Monday it placed great importance on the processing of tax refunds to ensure taxpayers eligible for a tax refund receive their refund in the stipulated timeframe. 

“However, failure in updating personal information and bank account details results in the failure to complete the tax refund process,” it said in a statement.

Based on 2018 records, 6.22% or about RM486.29mil in refund failed to be paid.

Firstly, undelivered cheques or vouchers to taxpayers due to difference in taxpayer’s address with the address registered in the IRB’s database;

Secondly, mismatch of bank information, account number and identification number / company registration number between IRB’s database and with that of the bank; and

Thirdly,  closed or inactive bank account.

The IRB advised taxpayers to update their latest personal and banking information in the annual Income Tax Return Form (ITRF) in a move to assist IRBM in minimising the failure rate of processing tax refunds. 

It said the taxpayers could also use the e-Kemaskini system or the feedback form which can be accessed online at any time through www.hasil.gov.my to update their personal and banking information.

It also said other crucial information to speed up the tax refund process include personal identification number, bank account number, correspondence address, telephone number, e-mail address and company registration number (for taxpayers in the company / organisation category).

It also said that from Jan 1, 2020, income tax refunds will be fully made using the electronic method of e-payment.

IRB added it would also increase the use of online tax refund payment transactions via the Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) method."

Currently over 40% of the top 20 largest banks in South-East Asia run on the company’s core banking solution. Based on the latest annual report, Goh is the group executive chairman of the company.Today, it is the core system platform partner of choice for three of the five  largest Asean super regional financial institutions.He saw his wealth declined by 25% last year amid a tough business environment. In 2017, Goh, who is also known as Malaysia’s very first tech billionaire, was on the 20th spot of the country’s top 40 richest people.  Silverlake’s profit for the period attributable to owners of the company decreased by 84% year-on-year in the first half of 2018 compared with a similar corresponding period in 2017. The company, which is listed on the Singapore Exchange mainboard, also saw its revenue dwindled by 3% in the same period.  This was caused by lower contributions from project related revenue segments like software licensing, software and hardware products sales, software project services and credits and cards processing. As of last year, the company’s market capitalisationstood at S$1.13bil from S$1.52bil. Its share price at the end of last year was down to S$0.42 from S$0.58 in 2017.Based on Silverlake’s latest annual report, it expects some of the positive business sentiments in the financial services industry to continue in FY2019. By executing the order book of projects, the company hopes to record a significant growth in project related revenue this year. Goh notes that Silverlake aims  to secure additional projects from the pipeline that is currently under discussion.

Value Partners is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. For most in the investment community, the history of Value Partners and its iconic founder has been a tale told many times. It has been an inspiring story, especially because its founder Cheah was once a journalist from Star Media Group who now owns one of the largest asset-management companies in Asia.For the uninitiated, Cheah was born in Penang in 1954 and started working in The Star at the age of 17 as a newspaper folder before subsequently becoming a reporter. He left Malaysia for Hong Kong in 1974.He was a journalist for 17 years, including in The Star, Asiaweek, The Far Eastern Economic Review and The Wall Street Journal (Asian Edition).It was while he was a financial journalist that Cheah realised that he had a passion for investment. He taught himself accounting and investment through books.Cheah felt that being good in finance was a necessity to perform well in his job as a financial journalist.He changed his career in 1989, joining Morgan Grenfell in Hong Kong as head of research in Hong Kong and China.In 1993, he started his own business by founding Value Partners in Hong Kong with his partner V-Nee Yeh, with less than US$5mil (RM22.12mil) under management. Today, Value Partners is one of Hong Kong’s biggest success stories.Today, Value Partners has assets under management worth US$16bil to date. Under the leadership of co-chief investment officers Cheah and Louis So, the company has transformed from a boutique firm to one of Asia’s most respected asset managers. In addition to its Hong Kong headquarters and new office in Kuala Lumpur, Value Partners operates offices in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Singapore, London and Boston.Value Partners Malaysia is also finally open for business. Last October, the Value Partners Malaysia office was launched after receiving an approval in principle from the Securities Commission for a capital market services licence for fund management.  Related stories:The rich became poorer by RM22bilTop 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 1Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 2Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 3Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 4Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 6Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 8"

TAN SRI FRANCIS YEOH AND FAMILYFlagship: YTL Group Net worth: RM6.93bilTHE Yeoh family maintains its 11th spot on the top 40 richest list, despite its net wealth declining by RM2.3bil or 25%  in 2018.Tan Sri Francis Yeoh helms YTL Corp Bhd , a diversified conglomerate, which was founded by his father, the late Tan Sri Yeoh Tiong Lay. YTL Corp together with its listed entities, YTL Power International Bhd , YTL Land & Development Bhd and YTL Hospitality REIT , has a combined market capitalisation of about RM19.2bil as at Dec 31, 2018.In recent years, the progress of the diversified business empire can be described as “lacklustre”.In Malaysia, the group suffered a loss of income from the expiry of a 21-year power purchasing concession for YTL Power in 2016. It is the nation’s first independent power producer with two power plants in Paka and Pasir Gudang with a combined capacity of 1,212MW.But under a short-term capacity bid called by the Malaysian Energy Commission, YTL Power has been able to supply from its Paka power station from Sept 1, 2017 onwards under the new power purchase agreement entered with Tenaga Nasional Bhd  for the supply of 585MW of capacity for a term of three years and 10 months until June 30, 2021.YTL’s unit in Singapore, PowerSeraya Ltd is also facing tough market conditions due to massive overcapacity. The lone profitable power generation company saw its profit after tax plunge 89% since 2013 to a low of S$25.3mil in 2016 although this recovered to S$41mil in 2017.And for the first time in the first quarter 2019, PowerSeraya chalked up losses due to a lower vesting contract level, lower retail non-fuel and tank leasing margin.Despite these setbacks, the YTL Group is currently pursuing the completion of two new power projects in Jordan and Indonesia.The group’s cement business is also affected by the prolonged cement price war amid overcapacity and subdued demand. The gloomy outlook is dampened by the new government’s pledge to review mega infrastructure projects that has led to delays or cancellations. Cement, which contributes about 16% to the group’s revenue, is expected to continue to decline due to overcapacity and weak cement prices.  In construction, save for the group’s two mega projects – the Gemas JB project and Tanjung Jati power plant in Indonesia – secured recently, the outlook remains subdued and lacklustre.Similarly, there are currently no major launches or large scale property development by YTL Land & Development, despite the group owning over 2,000 acres of strategic land bank in Malaysia.The hotels, resorts and REITs businesses will continue to provide the group with stable and consistent yields with no major growth expected. As at Sept 30, 2018, YTL Corp had a net debt of RM28.3bil.  Related stories:The rich became poorer by RM22bilTop 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 1Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 2Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 4Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 5Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 6Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 7Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 8"

TAN SRI NGAU BOON KEATFlagship: Dialog Group  Net worth: RM3.51bilNGAU’S fortunes rose by nearly 22% last year amid challenging times faced by the oil and gas sector.His net worth was higher at RM3.51bil last year from RM2.88bil a year earlier. With that he becomes the 17th richest Malaysian from the 21st spot earlier.At 70, he is still actively steering Dialog Group, a company which he co-founded and is now the executive chairman.He has a 20% stake in Dialog.Dialog Group is an oil and gas services provider that specialises in storage-tank terminals, engineering services and crude refining. It also is a top pick among the oil and gas sector companies of some research houses. Of the 15 analysts covering this stock as compiled by Bloomberg, ten have a “buy” call.They like the  “recurring income business model and earnings visibility. It has a strong track record of taking calculated and rewarding risks.’’“Dialog remains a secular growth story with the ability to scale up its terminal operations via its Pengerang/Langsat and potentially overseas ventures while still managing its financials well,’’ according to an analyst.For the full year ended June 30, 2018, Dialog’s net profit grew to RM510.3mil from RM370.64mil a year earlier. Revenue dipped to RM3.11bil from RM3.39bil a year earlier.Dialog has a market capitalisation of RM17.94bil and its share price is trading at RM3.18 a share. Over the next two years, maintenance activities in the oil and gas space are expected to rise, so is cost pressure, reports have said.With that background, Dialog will focus on diversifying across the value chain with regard to its oil and gas business to reduce earnings volatility. It will continue to work towards integrating the upstream-midstream-downstream aspects of its oil and gas businesses, said a report.The underlying rationale for that is to reduce earnings cyclicality in the context of pursuing structural growth, as a cyclical upswing in one sector can offset a cyclical downswing elsewhere, says an analyst report.Ngau, an engineer by profession, is very much the face of Dialog.He was also one of those who negotiated the first production sharing contract (PSC) way back in 1974. A report said the sealing of that contract helped change the course of the oil and gas industry in Malaysia.Ngau is also said to be a philanthropist at heart. He set up MyKasih Foundation, a non-profit organisation, which helps less-fortunate Malaysians in terms of food aid, health awareness, financial literacy programmes, children’s education and even skills training programs, a report says. Related stories:The rich became poorer by RM22bilTop 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 1Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 2Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 3Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 5Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 6Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 7Top 40 Richest Malaysians: Part 8"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/03/25/another-boost-for-proton/,Another boost for Proton,Auto,"Monday, 25 Mar 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Proton Holdings Bhd, a 51%-owned subsidiary of DRB-Hicom Bhd , has been on a roll with its latest plan to set up an assembly factory in Pakistan.The carmaker, which has been struggling in past years due to declining sales, is seeing signs of recovery following the emergence of China-based Geely which acquired a 49.9% stake in Proton in 2017.In a statement reply to StarBiz, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group said the move to set up a factory in South Asia was “part of Geely’s commitment to help restore Proton to its position as a bestselling brand in Malaysia and also a leading Asean brand.”Proton setting up factory in Pakistan will be its first facility in South Asia, tapping into a new market in a country with a population of 210 million.The plant will be a joint effort between the Malaysian carmaker and its local partner Alhaj Automotive.Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research said the plant in Pakistan marks an important milestone for Proton to expand its export market and becoming an international OEM.The research house reckons that Proton may not need to pump fresh capital expenditure into the plant in Pakistan as Proton will not own it. This would, in turn, benefit DRB-Hicom  in the long term.“Al-Haj had already acquired land for an assembly plant for Proton cars nearby Port Qasim area in Karachi. Al-Haj will own the assembly plant by itself, while Proton will provide the necessary technical support to Al-Haj,” HLIB said.It reckons that Al-Haj is the exclusive authorised distributor and assembler of Proton vehicles in Pakistan, following an official signing ceremony back in August 2018.  It was reported back then that Al-Haj planned to introduce modern and high tech vehicles in different categories including entry level sedans, mid-level sedans, crossovers/SUVs, MPV and hatchbacks in Pakistan. “We are positive with the new Proton plant set-up in Pakistan, in order to cater to the local Pakistan market, as well as potentially, the regional South Asia market. “We understand that Proton will not incur capex for the Pakistan assembling plant, as Proton does not own the plant,” HLIB said in its recent report.It maintained its “buy” call on DRB-Hicom with a target price of RM2.58 on the back of strong demand from Proton’s first SUV model, the X70, which set a precedent to the next model launches by Proton.“We believe the strong demand for Proton’s new X70 will provide confidence to the market on Proton’s subsequent new model launches (based on Geely platform),” HLIB said.Three months ago, Proton launched its first SUV model, the X70, which has boosted the carmaker sales significantly.Proton’s sales rose 42% year-on-year to 12,300 units in the first 2 months, of which almost half was from SUV X70 sales.The SUV X70 sales had also boosted DRB-Hicom earnings. The group recorded a net profit of RM73.02mil for its third quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, compared with a net loss of RM70.03mil in the previous corresponding period, due to better operating financial performances from all of its business divisions.Revenue in the third quarter rose to RM3.17bil from RM2.9bil a year earlier.“The higher revenue was contributed by the better performance of the automotive companies, including the sale of the X70 SUV by Proton, which was launched in December 2018,” DRB-Hicom said."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/03/25/march-31-deadline-looms-for-svdp/,March 31 deadline looms for SVDP,Taxation,"Monday, 25 Mar 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The first deadline of March 31, is coming up for the government’s Special Voluntary Disclosure Programme (SVDP), the tax programme where volunteers come forward to declare previously undeclared or under declared income, at a reduced penalty rate.There are presently some issues for those who are submitting close to the March 31 deadline, as payment under this programme can only be made after the ‘Notice of Assessment’ is out.As of March 8, the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) has reported that over 225,000 taxpayers have come forward in the first phase of the SVDP which ends on 31 March 2019.While the amount collected is not verified, channel checks have shown that the figure is close to RM2bil.Officially as of Feb 21, voluntary disclosures with additional taxes and penalty collected amounted to RM1.31bil.The biggest question for tax payers looking to meet the March 31 deadline is this: If they come forward with the voluntary disclosure before the stipulated deadline of March 31, but the notice of assessment comes out after March 31, does this mean that the taxpayer is still entitled to the 10% penalty?Tax Advisory and Management Services Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Yong Poh Chye said that the IRB has clarified that if the returns have been submitted by March 31, the penalty will still be 10%, and not 15%. “Even if the notice of assessment is issued after April 1, taxpayers still have 30 days to settle the tax payment at the 10% penalty,” said Yong. The notice of assessment is a written decree given by the IRB that states the taxable income, amount of tax that is due, refund amount if any, and other related information. Yong said this issue would be more important for taxpayers looking to make the June 30 deadline.This is because the penalty by then would differ sharply. It is 15% before June 30, and skyrockets to between 80% and 300% after July 1. Typically, the notice of assessment can take between a week or two to be released to the taxpayer. The IRB introduced the VDP to enable taxpayers to make voluntary disclosures of income generated from sources within Malaysia and kept in overseas bank accounts which have yet to be declared for Malaysian tax purposes.It has reduced the penalty for this to 10% if the income is reported by or before March 31, and 15% if done before or by June 30.Come July 1, the penalty will be between 80% and 300%.Thus, there is a huge difference should the disclosure on income be made before and after July 1.For example, if the taxable income is RM1mil and it is paid before July 1 but after March 31. The 15% tax rate would mean tax payments of RM150,000.Should this taxable income be declared after July 1, then the amount that needs to be paid will increase dramatically, ranging between RM800,000 to RM3mil.“Not everybody will be subjected to that 300% rate. For instance, taxpayers who have under declared their income after July 1, then they are only taxed a maximum of 100%. For taxpayers who have never paid tax before in their life and report after July 1, then they will be taxed 300%. Malaysia, together with more than 100 countries, have signed an agreement to partake in the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) initiative under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on financial information, particularly bank account ownership and has begun receiving this information from September 2018.In a media statement March 8, the IRB has received information from 57 countries on more than 455,000 bank accounts opened by Malaysians. Therefore, these 455,000 bank accounts will need to make a disclosure should their income be generated from within Malaysia but the income has yet to be reported to IRB.On that note, taxpayers who do not have overseas bank account but still have undeclared or under declared income derived from Malaysia,  also need to report their income to the IRB. Taxpayers in this category are still eligible for the reduced penalty rate of 10% or 15%, should they join the SVDP."

In what many see as a bad omen for the U.S. economy, yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year treasury notes fell further below three-month rates in Asia on Monday, an inversion that has in the past signaled the risk of economic recession.

The yield curve inverted on Friday for the first time since mid-2007.

Evans described the inversion as ”pretty narrow”.

“We have to take into account that there’s been a secular decline in long-term interest rates,” Evans said in comments at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong, days after the Fed signalled an end to its tightening and abandoned plans for further rate hikes in 2019.

“Some of this is structural, having to do with lower trend growth, lower real interest rates,” he said. 

”I think, in that environment, it’s probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically.” 

On the sidelines of the conference, Evans told CNBC in an interview that he could understand why investors were more “watchful, waiting and looking,” adding the Fed was doing the same. 

But, he added, economic fundamentals were ”good” and he expected growth to be around 2 percent this year.

“Your first reaction is gonna (be) ‘wow, this is less than what we had’ and I think this is missing the message.”

TIME TO PAUSE

On the monetary policy outlook, Evans said it was a good time for the U.S. central bank to pause and adopt a cautious stance, adding he did not expect any interest rate hikes until the second half of next year.

Softening his tone from a few months ago, Evans, who votes on interest rate policy this year, said monetary policy was neither accommodative, nor restrictive at this point.

“I see things impeding inflation a bit, and I want to see inflation get up. So my own path is not to expect a funds rate increase until next year, probably, the second half,” Evans said.

He added that with downside risks looming and uncertainties rife, it is prudent for the Fed to wait for more economic data and also said a cut was a possibility if the economy softened even more or inflation ran too low.
That echoed the view of fellow policymaker Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who on Friday said both possibilities are on the table for him.

In January, Evans said the Fed could hike interest rates three times in 2019 assuming the U.S. economy remained reasonably strong.

Last week, the U.S. central bank left rates steady in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. Fresh forecasts showed 11 of 17 Fed policymakers expected no rate change for the rest of the year, up from just two in December.
That unexpectedly dovish signal had financial markets quickly pricing in a rate cut next year. - Reuters"

The loan would give Bumi Armada breathing room to sell assets and restructure its business in a bid to return to profitability, one of the people said. The company is expected to sign the loan agreement with lenders as soon as the next few weeks, the people said.
Shares of Bumi Armada rose as much as 5.4% in morning trading yesterday. They were up 2.7% to 19 sen at the mid-day break in Kuala Lumpur, on track for the biggest gain in a week.
“The company has stated that it is working with the lenders and aims to have a refinancing of the corporate debt in place by the end of April,” a representative for Bumi Armada said, declining to comment further. “That remains the current position.”
Local brokerage JF Apex Securities Bhd. cut its recommendation on the stock this month to “hold,” from “buy,” over concerns about its debt refinancing as well as execution risks and lower crude oil prices. 
It’s also recently been downgraded by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd . and Macquarie Group Ltd.
Shares of Bumi Armada tanked 80 percent last year, while the benchmark FBM KLCI declined 5.9%. The company reported a net loss of RM2.3bil in 2018, compared with a net income of RM352.2mil a year earlier.
Bumi Armada had RM1.58bil of unsecured short-term term loans at the end of last year, and is in discussions with lenders about refinancing the debt with long-term borrowings, according to a February exchange filing. The company is planning to sell assets, optimize its cost structure and pursue collections from customers to strengthen its cash flow, the filing showed.
Ananda is Malaysia’s fifth-richest person with a net worth of about RM18.4bil, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. — Bloomberg"

PNB chairman Tan Sri Dr Zeti Aziz said ASB2 would distribute a total payout of RM610.7 million to its 404,706 unitholders who own a total of 10.4 billion units while ASM would distribute a total payout of RM1.1 billion to 541,758 unitholders with a total of 19.5 billion units.

“As at Feb 28 this year, ASB2 recorded a net realised income of RM500 million, while ASM recorded a net realised income of RM800 million,” she said when announcing the funds' income distribution here today.

 She also said that the three variable price funds, namely ASN Equity 3, ASN Imbang 2 and ASN Sara 1, have declared an income distribution of 4.10 sen per unit, 4.20 sen per unit and 5.00 sen per unit, respectively.

The total income distribution for all three funds, which amounted to RM236.1 million, would benefit 220,188 unitholders.  

There would be a temporary suspension of transactions for all five funds at all branches until March 2019 to facilitate the computation of income distribution, and transactions will resume on April 1.

Meanwhile, Zeti said PNB's investment strategy going forward is diversification and it would look at opportunities in both advanced and emerging economies, albeit in a gradual manner.

“We will not rush into it because we need to build up our expertise and monitor these markets, as well as engage with other investment corporations.

“PNB will always perform our function as a responsible investor and we are not going to contribute to any disruptive movements in our domestic market or to any of our strategic investments in companies,” she added.

The challenging economic environment in 2018 with moderating growth and uncertain financial markets in both the global and domestic economic and financial environment has affected the performance of Malaysia's corporations including PNB.

Nevertheless. PNB's total Assets Under Management (AUM) increased by 6.9 per cent to RM298.5 billion, from RM279.2 billion in the previous year.

Commenting on the outlook for the local stock market, chief executive officer Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad expressed confidence that it would eventually reflect the strength of the Malaysian economy, which is anticipated to grow between 4.3 per cent and 4.9 per cent this year.

“Fundamentally, we believe the economy is strong and we remain optimistic over the medium term,” he added. - Bernama"

Boeing, in the midst of one its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems aboard its 737 MAX aircraft are safe, and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.

A Boeing official in Seattle said on Wednesday the timing of the software upgrade was ""100 percent independent of the timing of the Ethiopian accident,"" and the company was taking steps to make the anti-stall system ""more robust.""

There was no need to overhaul Boeing's regulatory relationship with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now, the company said.

""We are going to do everything that we can do to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,"" Mike Sinnett, Vice President for Product Strategy and Future Airplane Development told reporters.

The FAA said it had not reviewed or certified the software upgrade yet.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and some lawmakers on Wednesday questioned why Boeing did not require safety features on its top-selling plane that might have prevented the crashes.

""It is very questionable if these were safety-oriented additions, why they were not part of the required template of measures that should go into an airplane,"" she said, adding she was not ready to require that all safety options be retrofitted on existing airplane.

A spokesman for the FAA said the agency had not reviewed or certified the software upgrade yet.

Executives with U.S. airlines welcomed Boeing's moves, but want U.S. regulators to sign off on the upgrade.

Southwest Airlines Co, which on Wednesday became the first major airline to formally cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its MAX fleet of 34 jets out of service, supported Boeing's decision.

""Boeing's software update appears to add yet another layer of safety to the operation of the MAX aircraft,"" Southwest's certificate chief pilot Bob Waltz said.

Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines Group Inc pilots, said it was pleased with Boeing's progress but warned the certification process should not be rushed. The fix should be fully vetted and take into account any further information from an investigation into an Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, the association said in a statement.

United Airlines vice president Michael Quiello said the airline was optimistic about the software update, but was counting on the FAA to certify the change.

Airline stocks turned positive after Boeing unveiled the software fix. CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, who has a ""buy"" rating on Boeing, said news from the company and the Washington hearing were positive steps towards getting the MAX jets airborne again.

EXTRA COMPUTER TRAINING

The world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the accidents, in Indonesia last October, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.

It will also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the ""angle of attack,"" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offer widely different readings, Boeing said. Reuters reported those details earlier this week.

The anti-stall system - known as MCAS, or Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - has been pinpointed by investigators as a possible cause in a fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia and the one in Ethiopia.

Existing 737 pilots will also have extra computer-based training following criticism that MCAS was not described in the aircraft manual.

Boeing has previously said existing cockpit procedures would cover any example of runaway controls caused by MCAS.

The changes were drawn up in response to the Lion Air crash but are seen as crucial to regaining the trust of pilots, passengers and regulators after the Ethiopia crash prompted a worldwide grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes.

Ethiopian officials and some analysts have said the Ethiopian Airlines jet behaved in a similar pattern before crashing shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, but that investigation is still at an early stage.

Boeing's Sinnett said the software had been through extensive testing, including flights with the FAA. However, he said he could provide no timeframe for when the 737 MAX jets would return to service.

Boeing said it would change the design of the system so that it no longer relied on a single sensor. The changes also would make standard visual warnings to the pilots if the system had stopped working. Previously, those warning messages and displays had been optional.

Reuters reported in November after the Lion Air disaster that some aviation experts believed the optional alert could have alerted engineers about mechanical faults, leading to an industry debate over whether the system should be mandatory.

Current 737 MAX pilots have criticized Boeing for not disclosing more details about MCAS initially. Sinnett said the company has added details on MCAS to its flight crew operations manual. All pilots will need to complete this training before returning to the skies, he said.

John Hamilton, chief engineer for 737 Max flight displays, said in a statement that ""all primary flight information required to safely and efficiently operate the 737 MAX"" was already included without the features that would now be offered. - Reuters"

Industry experts generally have pegged the sale price between RM200,000 and RM250,000 per acre, which is described as the higher band of valuation for brownfield plantation land.
“The reserve price is believed to be at an average of RM200,000 per acre, which is on the higher side of recent transactions. 
“But if SDP is able to pull it off, it would be commendable,” said a source.
In relation to the disposal, SDP had placed an advertisement last week for the sale of several parcels of oil palm land scattered in Kuala Langat and Klang (Selangor), Sitiawan and Hilir Perak (Perak), Merlimau (Malacca), Kuala Muda and Kulim (Kedah) and Seberang Prai Selatan (Penang).
Of the total 4,377 acres, the largest tracts of land up for sale include the Bukit Hijau Estate- Patani Para (PP-1) and (PP-2) at 1,136.39 acres and 798.89 acres in Kuala Muda, while the smallest land bank is Sg Wangi Estate (SW-1) GRN145377 Lot 40537 at 4.56 acres in Sitiawan.
SDP has also put up a tender notice inviting prospective developers and investors to submit their offers for the respective land banks.
However, the plantation group did not stipulate how much it intends to sell these estates for. 
In 2018, plantation companies announced combined merger and acquisition  (M&A) deals estimated at RM1.24bil in Malaysia.
Notable M&As last year included United Plantations Bhd ’s acquisition of estates in Teluk Intan, Perak for RM414mil or RM120,336 per planted ha from Pinehill Pacific Bhd , and Boustead Plantations Bhd ’s disposal of its 138.9ha land in Penang to SP Setia Bhd , which fetched an even higher valuation of RM979,508 per ha.
Early this year, poultry-based Huat Lai Group, which was delisted in 2017, offered to buy United Malacca Bhd ’s four oil palm estates in Negri Sembilan and Melaka for RM175mil cash, or equivalent to about RM171,533 per ha.
Generally, brownfield oil palm land in Peninsular Malaysia is about 30% higher in terms of its valuation compared with those in Sabah and Sarawak, said an industry expert.
Reflecting on the latest development, a source told StarBiz that “I believe SDP is disposing of these estates which are ‘ideally located properties’ to prevent the compulsory acquisition by state governments for development”.
“By making this bold move to sell off its non-core and non-strategic land bank, SDP would be able to realise the true market value of these estates. 
“Overall, it is a very small area of SDP’s vast total land bank.” 
The source added that the potential proceeds from the large-tract land sale could also be the answer to SDP’s plan to raise new money that could be used to pay dividends to its shareholders at a payout rate of 43% to 45%.
The world’s largest oil palm planter by hectarage is also looking to further reduce its gearing ratio, which stood at 40% as at end-June 2018. 
Meanwhile, CIMB Investment Bank regional head of plantation research, Ivy Ng, said the huge land bank disposal by SDP this year came as no big surprise as “this is line with the group’s existing plans to sell some of its oil palm land bank to unlock their true value”.
Asked on the estimated combined value of the estates that were up for sale, she said: “I don’t think there is a guidance on this. All will depend on the offers received.”
Late last year, SDP executive deputy chairman and managing director Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh hinted that the group would be looking to divest its non-core assets in 2019. 
He was also quoted as saying “there would be certain transactions that would see us disposing of our non-core assets or even parts of existing estates that have been identified for development”.
Of late, planters have opted to buy up brownfield oil palm land given the strict ban on new oil palm land expansion in Malaysia and Indonesia, the rising cost of production, weak crude palm oil prices as well as a lack of interest in greenfield acquisitions.
And more interestingly, more old or abandoned oil palm land, especially those bordering new townships, are being sought after by local property developers. 
On Bursa Malaysia yesterday, SDP’s share price closed six sen higher to RM5.08 with 3.06 million shares being done."

Before taxes and other expenses, the firm said it made $212 billion, a figure similar to the combined military budgets of the 28 member states of the European Union.The financial information on Monday was disclosed in a prospectus for a planned bond sale of at least $10 billion to help fund the acquisition of a $69.1 billion stake in Saudi Arabia’s national petrochemicals firm. The 470-page document provided the first look under the hood of Aramco’s finances since the once-American-run firm was nationalized over three decades ago and its profits became state secrets.By disclosing Aramco’s profits and other detailed financial information, some Saudi officials hope they will quell any doubts about their determination to list Aramco publicly by 2021, in what would likely be the biggest ever IPO. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler, wants to use the IPO to raise tens of billions of dollars to build new futuristic new cities, diversify the kingdom’s oil-dependent economy and fund a host of non-oil industries like technology, entertainment and mining.The 33-year-old prince first broached the IPO in early 2016, but concerns over disclosing Aramco’s finances helped delay it for years, to the point that many bankers and Saudi officials working on the plan believed it would never happen."

Now it’s a Wall Street darling valued at $24 billion.For much of the past decade—one in which ride hailing grew from nothing into an indelible part of transportation—Lyft played the part of an also-ran to Uber Technologies Inc. It was subject to a series of aggressive tactics by Uber, which tried to corner the capital markets and make it difficult for competitors to land cash to fuel their growth.Inside Uber, then-Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and top executives including business chief Emil Michael said their objective was to far outraise any competitor.“There are going to be competitors. And we will kill them,” Mr. Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder, said in a 2011 podcast interview.But Lyft didn’t die. Instead, the company with the hot-pink logo will beat Uber to the public markets Friday after pricing its IPO Thursday at $72 a share, raising $2.34 billion. Investors hungry for its shares far outnumbered the amount available in the IPO. At its IPO price, Lyft has a market capitalization around $20.5 billion, according to a Dealogic share count before the deal priced, and a valuation on a fully diluted basis of $24.4 billion.Uber’s squeeze was at times so effective that even some Lyft investors worried there was a good chance the company wouldn’t survive. But Lyft was able to grow by seeking out unusual fundraising sources and capitalizing on key missteps by Uber that marred its brand.By the time they launch their IPOs, Lyft and Uber will have each raised more venture capital than any U.S. startup that has gone public, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. While many early investors in the companies initially believed a dominant player would win and be able to make healthy profit margins, billions have been plunged into a war over market share with giant losses at both companies. Uber plans to kick off its own pitch to public investors for its IPO within a month of Lyft, in an offering that could value the company as high as $120 billion."

While discussions with Wynn have broken down -- for now, at least -- Crown’s engagement with the U.S. suitor signaled a willingness to talk sale terms with an interested party. 

Crown shares haven’t given up all of yesterday’s gains, suggesting investors are still betting on a possible takeover.

The stock tumbled 8.5 percent to A$12.86 at 12:05 p.m. in Sydney on Wednesday. Crown had surged 20 percent on Tuesday after saying it was discussing a potential sale to the Las Vegas-based casino giant, which valued Crown at A$14.75 a share.

Crown, controlled by Australian billionaire James Packer, had confirmed the talks on Tuesday in a filing to the stock exchange after the Australian Financial Review reported the possible deal.

Hours later, Wynn said in a statement that it ended the talks “following the premature disclosure of preliminary discussions.”

Despite the current acrimony, Wynn may yet return to negotiate a deal given its strategic need to expand in Asia beyond its Macau property. 

Now that Crown has made clear that it’s on the market -- a rare opportunity for an industry that faces high barriers of entry with regulatory licenses -- it may see interest from other operators.

Hard Rock International Inc., Malaysian casino operator Genting Bhd . and private equity firms are potential suitors, analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said.

Meantime, Crown is left to finish the construction of a A$2.2 billion Sydney casino while the commitment of its major shareholder Packer, who owns almost half the company, is in doubt. 

The billionaire quit the board of Crown in March 2018 due to mental health issues and stepped down as a director of his private investment company three months later.

Wynn’s interest in Melbourne-based Crown reflected its desire to reach into another offshore market beyond Macau.

Unlike its competitors that already have footholds elsewhere in Asia -- from Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s Singapore resort to Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Ltd.’s City of Dreams in Manila -- Wynn is currently confined to the Chinese territory, where expansion is approaching its limit. 

And they’re all fiercely competing for an operating license in Japan, the region’s next gambling goldmine.

Yet Wynn would have been buying a company whose ambitions are in decline. 

Crown largely retreated from overseas markets after a crackdown in China in late 2016 that resulted in 19 current and former Crown staff being convicted of illegally promoting gambling on the mainland, receiving jail terms of as long as 10 months.

Crown is now almost solely focused on its domestic market, where big-spending VIP gamblers have become more elusive. - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/uber-is-said-to-seek-about-us$10b-in-years-biggest-ipo/,Uber is said to seek about US$10b in year's biggest IPO,Markets,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",11:02 AM MYT,"SAN FRANCISCO: Investors could get their first look at hundreds of pages of detailed information about Uber Technologies Inc. as soon as Thursday, as the ride-hailing giant gears up to publicly file for an initial public offering.

The global ride-hailing company will kick off a road show this month and would begin trading publicly in May, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Uber is seeking to raise about $10 billion, one of the people said.

The offering is expected to be the largest IPO this year and among the 10 largest of all time.

While Uber has released partial financial results for years, its IPO filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will provide the first complete look at its numbers and operations.

Prospective investors are hungry for the minutia, and they’re now armed with ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc.’s March 29 IPO as a reference point for picking apart Uber’s business and value.

”The main thing is going to be the ride-sharing metrics versus Lyft,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. 

“I think in the view of many investors Lyft is the little brother to Uber.”

Uber said in February that it generated $50 billion in gross bookings last year, up about 45 percent from 2017. 

But the figures show slowing growth. Of the $11.4 billion of net revenue in 2018, only $3 billion came in the last three months of the year, up only 2 percent from the previous quarter. 

While that number gave the San Francisco-based company a year-over-year quarterly growth rate of 25 percent -- high by most standards -- it fell well short of the 38 percent rate for the third quarter.

Investors will want an explanation for Uber’s flattening trajectory, a possible signal that its core ride-hailing business may be stalling. 

They’ll also want to know where the money is coming from as the company expands into food and freight delivery and scooters and bicycles, as it also eyes driverless and even flying vehicles.

Breaking out Uber’s U.S. ride-hailing business from its global operations will be a particular focus for those parsing its IPO to compare it to Lyft, which operates in the U.S. and Canada. A key point of inquiry will be whether Uber has already saturated the U.S. market.

“I don’t know if they’re going to give us enough to get to that level of specificity but the U.S. is the oldest most mature market,” said Tom White, a senior analyst at DA Davidson &amp; Co. “I think some investors think it has slowed significantly.” - Bloomberg"

It is understood that in the White Paper, Felda will get that sum of money from the Government in the form of grants, loans and guarantees in order to resolve the immediate needs of the agency and establish a viable direction for the company and settlers.

A sum of around RM2.4bil will be in loans to restructure Felda’s loans and RM2.1bil will be a grant to clear the settler’s interest for loans over the next 15 years.

More than RM200mil will be used to complete housing needs for second generation Felda settlers and close to RM500mil will be paid to help with living costs and future income.

Felda will also be branching out to cash crops to improve its earnings and that of settlers and to make the transition to the planting of cash crops, around RM1bil would be given to settlers to make their changeover to new cash crops.

The financial performance of Felda has been on a downward slide ever since its floated FGV Holdings Bhd in June 2012 on Bursa Malaysia. Losses mounted and its debt grew to a level where intervention by the Government became essential.

Felda had been dragged down too by questionable investments especially in properties of hotels by its investment arm Felda Investment Corp Sdn Bhd (FIC) with criticism being raised over the discrepancies in valuations.

It was reported that FIC's purchase of a four-star hotel in Kensington, London, in December 2014 for RM330mil was allegedly three times the actual price of the property.

FIC had also purchased Merdeka Palace Hotel and Suites in Kuching for RM160mil, which allegedly was some RM50mil above market value.

Former Felda chairman Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad has claimed trial to criminal breach of trust (CBT) and nine counts of bribery involving more than RM3mil over the purchase of the hotel in Kuching.

Another controversial deal completed in April last year was Felda’s purchase of a 37% stake in loss-making Indonesian planter PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk for US$505.4mil from the Rajawali Group.Related stories:Felda White Paper highlights: Finances worsened after 2012 FGV listingForensic studies on Felda's investmentsGovt to ensure Felda scheme sustainableNew business model by Felda"

The shares were listed at an issue price of RM4.55. 

* A total of RM10.5bil was raised from the listing of which Felda received RM6bil while FGV received the remaining RM4.5bil.

* In 2012, Felda posted net profit of RM5.8bil due to other income of RM4.7bil. Since then, it recorded net losses of RM2bil (2013), -RM1bil in 2014 and -RM1.1bil in 2015 and -RM700mil in 2016 and this worsened to -RM4.9bil in 2017.

* As at Dec 31, 2017, Felda's liabilities totalled RM14.4bil where RM12.1bil was owed to financial institutions.

* Between 2007 and 2011, Felda was in a net cash position at between RM1.8bil and RM3.9bil but this fell to only RM400mil in 2017. 

* Felda's revenue was at RM5.9bil in 2010 while its average income was RM3.1bil due to the strong crude palm oil prices which rose to RM3,283 per tonne in 2011.

* In 2012, Felda's revenue fell to RM100mil though in 2013, it was RM200mil while in 2014 and 2015, it was RM400mil in 2014 and 2015. In 2016 and 2017, its revenue was RM700mil.

* The decline in the revenue was because FGV was unable to make contribution as much as RM800mil a year as it had anticipated  before the IPO and also because CPO prices fell below RM3,000 per tonne since 2012 until now.

* In 2017, it posted net losses of RM4.9bil though CPO prices were RM2,790 per tonne compared the net profit of RM1.1bil in 2008 when CPO was at RM2,850 per tonne.

* The lend lease agreement did not provide the returns as projected when  FGV was listed, instead it had a negative impact on Felda's financial position.

* The net losses of RM4.9bil in 2017 were due to the deterioration in the income from plantation operations due to the negative impact from the LLA and also purchase of assets and investments in non-strategic assets like the purchase of assets which were above market price and poor governance.

* Felda's biggest expenses from 2007 to 2017 were for the financing to the settlers and contributions to the state government totalling RM13.1bil and also staff costs of RM2.7bil.

* Felda's financial position was also impacted by the special payment of RM1.7bil to the settlers in 2012.Related stories:Govt to provide RM6bil aid to FeldaForensic studies on Felda's investmentsGovt to ensure Felda scheme sustainableNew business model by Felda"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/forensic-studies-on-feldas-investments/,Forensic studies on Felda's investments,Corporate News,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",11:49 AM MYT,"The Ministry of Economic Affairs has released the white paper containing the forensic studies conducted by Erst & Young on eight of FELDA’s investments.

The paper reveals the discrepancies, the lack of due dilligence and poor risk management by FELDA’s board when making its investment decisions. 

In the spotlight would be Case 1, which is FELDA’s investment in PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk (EHP). 

In Dec 2015, FELDA’s board of directors approved the acquisition of exchangeable bonds’for shares in (EHP) via FIC Properties Sdn Bhd (FPSB) for RM505.4mil. 

On Oct 16, 2016, FELDA’s board approved the change of structure in the investment in EHP to a 37% stock acquisition instead, but at the same value of US$505.4mil. FELDA would make this acquisition from a private company in Indonesia (Company A1) and came with a put option. 

FPSB signed an Sales & Purchase agreement on Dec 31, 2016. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) was also involved in this investment process as they gave advice on the stucturing of the investment.

This acquisition was paid via a loan amounting to RM2.3bil from GOVCO Holdings Bhd, which is a company under MoF.

A corporate guarantee was given by FELDA at a rate of ‘cost of financing plus 15 basis points. This loan would need to be repaid in seven years. 

Checks show that Company A1 had already gotten EHP shares on Nov 2014 at a price of US$0.0247/IDR300 per share. 

FELDA would be able to recoup its investment amount and profit at a rate of 6% a year on Year 5 from Company A1 via the ‘put option’/ 

The put option could be triggered if any of the below took place:

1. EHP goes against its obligation to abide by the Roundtable on Sustainable Oil Palm (RSPO).

2. EHP fails to get its RSPO certification within two years.

3. Company A1 commits a material breach

4. Should Company A1 or the major shareholder of company A1 or EHP initiate or consents to judicial proceedings relation to itself under any applicable liquidation, insolvency, composition, reorganisation . . “

Key findings:

1. The acquisition price was higher than the market price. 

2. The acquisition of EHP shares at US$505mil (US$0.043/IDR584 per share) on Dec 23, 2016 was way higher than two independent valuation prices of US$264mil and US$404mil. 

3. The acquisition price was 95.86% higher compared to EHP’s market price on the date of the acquisition. 

4. Another finding showed that when FELDA’s board approved the acquisition of EHP shares via a special purpose vehicle at the same price on Dec 7, 2017, EHP’s market price was even lower then at US$0.0098/IDR135 per share. This means 
that FELDA agreed to buy EHP shares 344.12% higher than its market price at that time. 

5. EHP’s market price on April 4, 2019 was only US$0.012/IDR176.

6. There is an impairment of value of RM1.58bil for Felda’s financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 via the entry ‘Fair value through profit or loss’.

Furthermore, the investment in EHP goes against FELDA’s investing principles. 

This is because the acquisition of EHP shares, even with the put option, would have only given a return of 6% a year. FELDA’s investing principles calls for a minimum return that is higher than the average market return rate. 

Besides that, the net return of 1.05% a year was also lower than the minimum fix rate of 1.15% set by Felda’s board. As of Dec 31, 2017, that net return had dropped to 0.9%.

There is also no evidence to show that a credit assessment was conducted by FELDA on company A1 in 2016, with regards to its ability to repay the full investment via the put option, should that scenario take place. 

Thus, the board of directors in FELDA had approved the investment in EHP despite knowing that:

1. The board of directors in FGV and FIC did not support the acuquisition due to its high high valuations. 

2. The acquisition price was US$241mil higher than its market price from the assessment report.

3. Shares in EHP had dropped 41.6% from June 11, 2015 to Oct 15, 2015.

4. Bank Negara had issued many questions with regards to the investment structure, benefits of the acquisition and the usage of capital. 

Despite knowing the risks involved, FELDA’s board had approved this investment without additional due diligence and without any explanation during its minute meeting. 

Lastly, FELDA’s financial statements for Dec 31, 2017 with regards to the EHP investment may not be accurate. FELDA’s consolidated accounts should reflect this investment as an investment in an allied company.

The agency also has to utilise its resources optimally to ensure that greater economic opportunities along with generating higher incomes for settlers.

“Several new emphasis have been identified and among them is to restructure Felda, strengthen its core activities by identifying a new plantation management model, strengthen its financial position and intensify initiatives that are linked to the welfare and prosperity of the settlers,” said the White Paper.

Felda will also raise its value-added activities and improve synergies through out its value chain via strategic cooperation with agencies that are involved in high potential farming and plantations.

For the short-term, measures have been identified to improve accountability and integrity within Felda to ensure public confidence and trust from the public, said the White Paper.

Steps are also being taken to make sure there is no political interference in the management of Felda to ensure that management is transparent and responsive.

According to the report, the government views the issue of embezzlement, misconduct and governance in all seriousness given how those factors have had a direct impact on Felda’s operations. 

“As a result, stern action will be taken on the person/persons responsible to send a strong message to officials and employees of Felda that there would be no compromise in misappropriation and abuse of power. 

“Felda will also empower an integrity complaint system and use The Whistleblower Protection Act 2010 to encourage individuals with information to step forward so that any misconduct particularly in regard to integrity can be stemmed from the very start.”

In the short-term, Felda will also initiate a group-wide structural reform to raise the level of professionalism based on the highest standard of corporate governance.  

It will also ensure that appointments of the management team are made up of professionals of credible stature. 

Besides that, to ensure that the voice of the Felda settlers is taken into account in shaping Felda’s direction, the organisation’s board of directors and management will be represented by the settlers’ representative and also from the new Felda generation, the report added.  

Felda will also study the involvement of its football team, FELDA United in Malaysia Super League which involves high financing cost. 

According to the report, several improvements in corporate governance have been taken on the structures of Felda, FGV Holdings Bhd and its subsidiaries. 

* The appointment of the chairman of Felda, FGV and FIC are from the circle of professionals and not based on political connection. 

* To ensure a separation of management accordingly between the chairman of Felda and the chairmanship of Felda subsidiaries with the aim to avoid conflicts of interest in decision-making that would be made by the board of directors of each company. 

* To undertake a management audit to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the people to the optimum level and of integrity. 

* To establish an investigation committee to execute action on the proposals and recommendations in the forensic audit report that was conducted. 

* To take stern action on officials and management of Felda involved in the embezzlement issue. 

* To improve the standard operating procedure to ensure accountability in the running of Felda. 

* To study related amendment of act/regulations in line with the new Felda model. 

* To improve management structure and the practice of lean management. 

Towards this end, the report said Felda will initiate among others strategies like right-sizing, eliminating department and company overlaps, realignment of main functions and business process reengineering. 

These holistic reforms are vital to ensure that Felda is able to spur growth and contribute towards the development of the settlers’ community. Related stories:Govt to provide RM6bil aid to FeldaFelda White Paper highlights: Finances worsened after 2012 FGV listingForensic studies on Felda's investmentsNew business model by Felda"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/new-business-model-by-felda/,New business model by Felda,Plantations,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",12:51 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: Felda will formulate a new business model where the government will manage the settlers land through a long-term rental arrangement. New cash crops would be planted, all aimed at generating higher incomes for Felda settlers, said the White Paper.

By doing so, the Government will address the issue of aging settlers and the shortage of new settlers and ensure that the settler’s land is managed efficiently and on a large scale basis so that the economies of scale can reduce operating costs.

The success of the new Felda model hinges on the optimum consolidation of land and the new model is designed to give a profit to all parties, particularly the settlers.

Settlers will have to be comprehensively briefed so they understand the benefits of the new model for its ability to generate higher and consistent incomes. Settlers who are able and want to toil their land will be given the opportunity subject to the criteria that have been established. Felda will not stop those settlers from joining the new Felda model if they choose to.

Felda will also be giving their main focus to the core activity of plantations and will be the largest manager of farming land in the country.

Felda will also be raising the initiatives to generate more income by diversifying into cash crops that are suitable and have high potential. By doing so, this will raise the production of food, increase exports and reduce the country’s dependence on imported food.

The agency will also ensure that the replacement planting and livestock programme is able to generate a harvest within a short period of time that is able to deliver on cashflow fast and on a consistent basis.

Among the replacement plantings is fruits, vegetables and kenaf, which will help reduce the dependency on oil palm and rubber. That effort would be executed with the help of cooperation between government agencies and the private sector.

That effort needed to be executed given that the price of palm oil is dependent on world prices that are uncertain and subject to various risks such as low demand from importing countries, trade restrictions from a number of countries in Europe and also volatile CPO prices.

The replanting programme into different cash crops will also alleviate the pressure on settlers due to the fall in commodity prices.

The pioneer programme to diversify crops has been done by Felda Bukit Rokan and will be expanded to other lands in the Felda scheme with the cooperation of strkeholders and the private sector through integrated planting and urban industries.

Felda will be surrender the management of the settlers’ land to active cooperation so that it can be done on a large scale and more economically.

Through the new model, settlers who choose the long-term rental arrangement would receive a lease payment and dividends from the profits of the cooperation. This would enable the settlers to get a more consistent income.

The settler’s cooperative in each Felda scheme, including Koperasi Permodalan Felda Bhd, would be strengthened with the involvement of the original and new generations of settlers in the management, investments and businesses that are operated by Felda.

Through this system, Felda will also produce more professional farmers who can contribute to the progress of the Felda community.

The introduction of the new business model for Felda is also expected to address demographic issues of settlers where the majority are aged 60 years and above, do not have the ability to manage their estates and have been burdened with 

debt that needed to be explained to Felda. 

Accordingly, the management of the settler farms by the cooperative would enable old settler’s farm to run with more fair, efficient and profitable to both the settlers and Felda.

In addition, existing plant management systems will be reviewed and improved to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness that will provide benefits to settlers. This review will also pay attention to the issue overlapping of farm management functions to optimise resources.

The use of mechanisation and automation technology will be expanded to improve productivity and reduce production leakage. In addition, an effective crop monitoring system will also be created to monitor the harvests.

Through the adoption of the technology, planting and harvesting methods can be improved and thus improve crop yield, reduce dependence on low-skilled foreign workers and attracting participation Felda’s new generation to actively engage in plantation activities.

Felda will also move towards the use of the latest technology based on smart farming through the integration of the latest technologies more widely in the field of plantations that is aimed at increasing the quantity and harvest yield. 

The implementation of smart farming will enable Felda to increase food production and deal with the issue of imported food."

At least four of the Hong Kong brokerage’s most senior managers are following Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Slone out the door amid mounting tension with Citic Securities Co., which bought CLSA in 2013, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Chief Operating Officer Nigel Beattie, who was in discussions to take over as CEO in the wake of Slone’s recent resignation, quit this month after failing to reach an agreement on how to run the company, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. 

Xen Gladstone, who ran sales and trading; Edmund Bradley, head of research; and Meade Thomson, head of Japan, also resigned, one of the people said.

The latest departures, which include three members of CLSA’s executive committee, highlight long-simmering concerns among some employees that the firm is losing its culture and independence as Citic, China’s biggest state-owned brokerage, tightens its grip on the business.

Citic’s takeover was viewed by some in the industry as a test case for whether a Chinese brokerage could successfully expand overseas and compete with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. 

While Citic said last month that it’s committed to expanding internationally, the combined company has yet to come anywhere close to matching the global reach of Wall Street’s giants. 

Some analysts have said that the departure of highly compensated executives such as Slone will help CLSA cut costs and boost profitability. But questions remain over whether the loss of seasoned international leaders will hurt the firm’s ability to grow its business outside China.

A CLSA representative declined to comment, as did Beattie. Gladstone, Bradley and Thomson didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Citic, whose chairman Zhang Youjun took over the same role at CLSA in February, didn’t immediately reply to an emailed query.

Skeptics of the Citic-CLSA tie-up have warned of a culture clash since day one, yet the two camps managed to keep tensions under control long enough to combine the businesses and weather a turbulent period for global capital markets.

That changed after a controversial drop of about 60 percent in CLSA’s 2018 bonus pool and a number of other recent changes instigated by Citic, including staff adjustments and an overhaul of CLSA’s compensation structure, people familiar with the matter said last month. 

Some members of CLSA’s executive committee, including Slone, didn’t receive a bonus for 2018 and were asked to take a pay cut for this year, two people said.

In a March 6 memo to employees, Zhang said the new pay structure would “incentivize the growth and development of our people while balancing their authority, responsibility and compensation.” 

Citic tried to convince Slone to stay, Zhang told a media briefing last month, adding that he resigned for personal reasons and would spend more time with his family in New York.

Citic shares were down 2.1 percent at 1:17 p.m. in Hong Kong, heading for a fourth day of losses.

CLSA, whose no-holds-barred research and star-studded investment conferences lured generations of money managers to Asia’s markets, has about 2,000 staff in 20 offices across Asia, Australia, the Americas and Europe.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/were-not-even-close-to-the-next-great-recession/,We’re not even close to the next great recession,Economy,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",2:07 PM MYT,"WHAT’S all the fuss about?

Maybe the world economy isn’t in such terrible shape after all. New projections from the International Monetary Fund, published Tuesday, show that expansion still has some legs. Growth will be a not-too-shabby 3.3 percent this year.

That’s down from a previous forecast of 3.5 percent. So, yes, it’s a cut. But not a dramatic one. These numbers are a ways from one IMF definition of recession, 2.5 percent, and miles from the contraction recorded in 2009. Superlatives about the lowest growth since the Great Recession are misleading.

These updates from the IMF also make you wonder where all the drama – so prevalent in headlines – is coming from. A bounce in U.S. job growth last month, signs of a partial recovery in China and a dovish pivot from big central banks give some comfort.

Let’s not get too giddy, though. A recession in, say, the U.S. is inevitable at some point. The current expansion will this year become the longest ever. Germany is flirting with recession and China is on a long-term trajectory of slower growth.  

On the surface, the IMF numbers don’t say anything dire. Their direction does make an impression – this was the third time the lender has marked down its numbers in six months. You have to give them credit for staying current. Is the IMF’s track record perfect? Far from it. (I’m writing this column from Indonesia, scene of one of the IMF’s most contentious programs).

Private sector doomsayers deserve equal scrutiny. Next time you see a survey showing recession odds, question why and how far it deviates from consensus. Same with the hagiographies accorded some individual investors whose prognostications just glide by without review. I’m all for putting the IMF under the microscope; let’s do the same for others.

The list of risks outlined by the IMF in its World Economic Outlook could use a little refreshing. Trade wars? Check. Brexit? Sigh. What else you got?

IMF chief Christine Lagarde calls this a “delicate moment” for the world economy. Central banks have a role to play as well, in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

As I wrote late last month, the idea of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve was a fringe theory that’s now come into the mainstream, even if it’s not quite consensus. If cuts do come to pass, it won’t be because the Oval Office wants it. It will be because of reasoned analysis that inflation is too low, or at risk of being so, and that risk management requires the Fed to take out some insurance. 

It’s entirely possible the world economy muddles through this year. It might be messy and there will be regional divergences aplenty.

The economy may not feel great, particularly depending on where you are. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible. - Bloomberg

The city’s equity market has overtaken Japan to be the world’s third largest in value, behind only the U.S. and mainland China, courtesy of a rebound in Hong Kong stocks after their worst year since 2011.

Hong Kong’s market cap was $5.78 trillion as of Tuesday, the latest available data show, compared with $5.76 trillion for Japan. 

The Asian city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index climbed 17 percent this year through Tuesday, when it closed at its highest since June 15. 

Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. has been the main driver with a 22 percent gain. Japan’s Topix Index advanced 8.3 percent in that period.

Both markets were lower Wednesday, as an economic outlook from the International Monetary Fund renewed concern about a slowdown in global growth and after the U.S. threatened tariffs on the European Union. 

The Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent as of 11:38 a.m. in Hong Kong, still just above the 30,000-point level that it broke through earlier this month. The Topix was down 0.7 percent. - Bloomberg"

Axiata said in a statement that it is reviewing the decision of the Supreme Court while noting that it and subsidiary Ncell have complied with all relevant regulatory and legal requirements in relation to the transaction.

On Feb 6, the SC ordered Ncell and Axiata to pay capital gains tax of 61 billion rupees (RM2.16bil), excluding late fees, for the indirect transfer of an 80% stake in Ncell to Axiata UK via the purchase of Reynolds Holdings Ltd from TeliaSonera Norway Nepal Holdings AS.

""The Order states that the Large Taxpayers Office (LTPO) should determine the outstanding tax amount to be paid in relation to the Transaction within three months from the date of receipt of the Order by the LTPO and that the responsibility to pay tax lies with Ncell and Axiata, the latter who is not a party to the PIL. 

""The SC also indicated that distribution of dividends and any sale of Ncell shares by anyone should not be granted until the tax obligation is satisfied,"" said Axiata.

The group added that it has made significant contributions to the socio-economic development of Nepal and remains committed as a long-term investor in the country.

""As the largest taxpayer, contributing NPR 125. 68 billion (USD 1.17 billion) in taxes since Fiscal Year FY 2014/2015, we believe that the Government of Nepal will be supportive of our commitment and use our investment as a demonstration of the willingness and openness of Nepal to attract further foreign investment,"" it said."

Inventories in Malaysia, the world’s second-largest palm oil producer and exporter, declined 4.6 percent to 2.92 million tonnes (MYPOMS-TPO), the first time since October 2018 that stocks were less than 3 million tonnes, data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) showed. 

The fall in end-stocks could support benchmark palm oil prices, which have gained more than 5 percent so far this month. Palm oil was last up 0.1 percent at 2,214 ringgit ($540.66) a tonne at Wednesday’s midday break. 

Strong exports have also been supportive of palm prices, with the MPOB data showing a 22.4 percent jump in March from the previous month to 1.62 million tonnes. 

The export gains (MYPOME-PO) on a monthly basis are the strongest in six months. 

Low prices and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan have prompted restocking activities by buyers, said a Kuala Lumpur-based trader. 

“Exports were quite good due to Indian buying. This and next month (are) summer in India, when they tend to buy more. Some exports were also due to Ramadan,” the trader said. 

Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month that begins in early May this year, sees devotees break day-long fasts with communal feasting, increasing palm oil usage for food and cooking.

Importers typically stock up on the edible oil one to two months ahead of the festival. 

The MPOB data also showed that output in March rose to 1.67 million tonnes, up 8.3 percent from February and registering its first gain after four months of decline. 

The output, however, is at the highest for March in Malaysia, according to Refinitiv Eikon records going back to January 2000. 

“Production came in higher than expected ... It could be due to a lower harvesting cycle in February,” said another Kuala Lumpur-based trader, explaining that public holidays in February could have delayed some harvesting activities to March. 

A Reuters survey had forecast palm oil’s end-March stockpiles to fall 6.4 percent to 2.85 million tonnes, while production was forecast to rise 6.8 percent to 1.65 million tonnes. Exports were expected to gain 23.4 percent to 1.63 million tonnes.

Profit for the latest 12 months was ahead of expectations and the company said it’s on track to reach its goal of an operating margin of 3.5 percent to 4 percent in the current year. The results offer another sign that Tesco is emerging from years under the shadow of a massive accounting scandal.

“After four years we have met or are about to meet the vast majority of our turnaround goals,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis said in a statement.

In what it described as an “uncertain market,” where other retailers are suffering from Brexit-related jitters and the rise of online shopping, the supermarket operator is using its scale to keep a lid on costs. Tesco announced in January that it would close some of its fresh-food counters, affecting as many as 9,000 employees in the U.K.

As rival J Sainsbury Plc awaits the outcome of a regulatory review of its planned purchase of Walmart Inc.’s Asda, Tesco is already reaping benefits from its purchase of wholesaler Booker last year. The new unit boosted operating profit by 196 million pounds ($256 million) for the latest 12 months.

Overall comparable sales for the fourth quarter rose 1.7 percent in the U.K., just below analysts’ estimate of 1.8 percent. Although Tesco’s U.K. business performed well, it’s struggling in central Europe and Asia, where comparable sales declined for the year. - Bloomberg"

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led the deal alongside Bank of China Ltd. and CMB Wing Lung Bank Ltd., said the people who are not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. 

Bytedance, which operates the hugely popular apps TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin, declined to comment on the loan.

The deal marks Bytedance’s debut in the syndicated loan market and underscores its growing clout in attracting some of the biggest international lenders. 

Late last year, the company got a $3 billion funding from SoftBank Group Corp. and other major investors at a valuation of $75 billion, cementing its position as the world’s biggest privately backed startup.

TikTok and Douyin are two of the fastest-growing apps in the world, and rely on users recording clips typically set to music. The TikTok app has been installed more than 1 billion times via the App Store and Google Play, according to Sensor Tower.

The deal is also a rare case of a young startup winning a loan of this size from Asia’s syndicated loan market, where banks are typically more comfortable with lending to mature brick-and-mortar companies.

Other top-tier lenders for the syndicated loan include Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and UBS Group AG, the people said. China Everbright Bank Co. and China Merchants Bank Co. also joined.

The owner of Chinese news aggregator Toutiao offered an interest margin of 280 basis points on top of the London interbank offered rate for its debut syndicated loan, the people added. - Bloomberg"

The EU reimposes the levies on Russian, Korean and Malaysian exporters of the fittings, which are used to join tubes or pipes mainly in the petrochemical, energy, construction and shipbuilding industries, for another five years to protect producers in the bloc such as Vallourec Fittings, Erne Fittings and Virgilio Cena & Figli from below-cost -- or “dumped” -- sales.

“The union industry would be likely to experience a further deterioration of its situation in case the anti-dumping measures against Malaysia, Korea and Russia were allowed to lapse,” the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels, says in the bloc’s Official Journal.

The duty levels are 23.8% for Russian producers; 44% for all Korean manufacturers except TK Corp., which faces a 32.4% rate; and 75% for all Malaysian producers except Anggerik Laksana, which is subject to a 59.2% levy, and Pantech Steel Industries, which has a 49.9% rate.

The expiring EU levies on steel tube fittings from Turkey are as high as 16.7%, depending on the Turkish exporter.

That’s why a once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy established resorts in Australia could
escalate into a bidding war.

Crown Resorts Ltd., controlled by billionaire James Packer -- the one-time fiancé of singer Mariah Carey -- this week disclosed a A$9.99 billion ($7.12 billion) takeover offer from Wynn Resorts Ltd. and said the two companies were discussing a deal. 

The talks were short-lived. Wynn said they were revealed too soon and ended negotiations.

The discussions were initially reported in the Australian Financial Review, a local newspaper, and confirmed shortly later by Crown. It looked like a tried-and-tested play to root out a
higher bidder -- until Wynn walked away.

But with Crown now known to be on the market, Packer may yet land a deal. After surging 20 percent on the talks with Wynn, Crown stock retreated just 9.1 percent when the discussions collapsed. 

With the Wynn talks on hold for now, rival suitors such as Hard Rock International Inc. and Malaysia’s Genting Bhd . may engage, according to Deutsche Bank AG.

A representative for Crown, which owns casinos in Melbourne and Perth and is building a third in Sydney, declined to comment on the leaked talks with Wynn or why they broke down so abruptly.

Rare Deal

Governments worldwide typically keep a tight grip on new gaming licenses, which partly explains why it’s so rare for a casino company to sell up. 

A takeover of Crown at the price proposed by Wynn would be the industry’s biggest acquisition in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg data going back to 2007.

Beyond Wynn, Crown also might be a match for other companies with casino operations in Singapore or Macau because of the potential synergies, said David Bonnet, managing partner at Delta State Holdings Ltd. specializing in hospitality and gaming consulting.

“For businesses already operating in the region, it makes sense too to consider the deal,” said Bonnet. “Acquisition is the only way to enter a monopoly-style market.”

‘Overseas Opportunities’

Suncity Group Holdings Ltd. has been expanding outside Macau in recent years and is building a casino in Vietnam. The company said it wants to head offshore but Wynn’s offer for Crown was too high.

“We actively keep our eyes on overseas opportunities around the region as the footprint expansion can help create more synergies among our businesses in each gaming hub,” said Andrew
Lo, executive director of Suncity.

Genting, with resorts stretching from the U.S. to Singapore, has experience of the Australian market. In 2012, it owned about 10 percent of Crown’s rival in Australia, Star Entertainment Group Ltd. before a 2017 sell down. A company representative declined to comment.

Hard Rock International, which has casino resorts across North America, is one of the many companies with designs on a casino license in Japan. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

A corporate retreat by the billionaire Packer has looked more likely since late 2016, when a crackdown in China resulted in 19 current and former Crown staff being convicted of illegally promoting gambling on the mainland, where it is banned. In the same year, he had an ugly public break up with Carey.

Crown is now almost solely focused on its domestic market. Packer quit the board of Crown in March 2018 due to mental health issues and stepped down as a director of his private investment company three months later.

For Wynn, the Crown deal would have represented a chance to catch up to competitors who already have footholds in Asia beyond Macau. 

Unlike Las Vegas Sands Corp., which has a resort in Singapore, or Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd., which has built a ""City of Dreams"" in Manila, Wynn is currently confined to the Chinese gaming enclave, where expansion is approaching its limit. 

And they’re all fiercely competing for an operating license in Japan, seen as the region’s next gambling goldmine.

Given its need for growth beyond Macau and the few options available, Wynn may yet return to negotiate a deal with the Melbourne-based company, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Vitaly Umansky wrote in a note.

The prospect of Wynn buying Crown, while “perplexing,” may have some merit given the slowdown in Macau, he said.- Bloomberg"

After a two-year bet that paid off with GDS Holdings Ltd, a Beijing-based operator of data centres, Jen Lai is now doubling down on Hong Kong-listed Bestway Global Holding Inc. 
The Dalton Investments LLC portfolio manager has bought more of the shares this year after first discovering the stock in the second half of 2018.
Bestway fits Lai’s typical picks: a stock with little or no analyst coverage, valued at no more than US$2bil, trading at 20 times price-to-earnings or less, and with 20% annual revenue and profit growth. 
Her firm plans to launch a long-only product that focuses on Chinese companies with similar characteristics.
“These are growing companies that are taking share in good industries,” Lai said in an interview from Santa Monica, California. “They are run by good entrepreneurs who are nimble, adaptive, and have been good long-term stewards of capital.”
Bestway’s profit may increase by about 22% this year on adjusted basis and another 18% in 2020, according to Crosby Securities Ltd. With a market value of HK$3.6bil (US$459mil), average daily volume this year is about 720,000 shares. 
That compares to the 11 million shares that typically change hands for the smallest stock on the Hang Seng Index – AAC Technologies Holdings Inc.

The proposed deal, which values Crown at A$14.75 per share, 26% more than Monday’s closing price, will also allow Packer to divest his single largest asset, completing a remarkable corporate retreat for a titan who’s been beset by political trouble and mental health issues in recent years.
Crown shares soared yesterday in Sydney trading after the company confirmed confidential discussions, climbing 19.7% to close at A$14.05. Crown’s Australian rival Star Entertainment Group Ltd jumped 5.4%, while shares of New Zealand casino Skycity Entertainment Group Ltd rose 2%.
Wynn’s interest in Melbourne-based Crown, which is almost solely focused on its domestic market where big-spending VIP gamblers have become more elusive, seems unusual, but the Las Vegas-based empire is desperately seeking to shore up its presence among Asian bettors.
Unlike its competitors who already have footholds elsewhere in Asia - from Las Vegas Sands Corp’s Singapore resort to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd’s City of Dreams in Manila - Wynn is currently confined to Macau, where expansion is approaching its limit. And they’re all fiercely competing for an operating license in Japan, the region’s next gambling goldmine.
“Wynn’s pursuit of Crown represents the need for Macau operators to expand in other markets to support long-term profit growth,” said Bloomberg Intelligence Asia gaming analyst Margaret Huang. But the deal will siphon off cash that Wynn could have used on a Japanese resort, estimated to cost up to US$10bil, and Australia’s weakened gaming demand is concerning, she said.
Union Gaming Group LLC analyst John DeCree said that the acquisition was likely a defensive move on Wynn’s part, in order that it not become a takeover target for rivals like Las Vegas Sands or MGM Resorts International.
“Not only would a larger enterprise be a more difficult target, but it would deter potential suitors as US-based peers have little to no strategic interest in Australia,” he wrote in a note.
Crown said in a statement that discussions are at a preliminary stage and no agreement has been reached between the parties in relation to the structure, value or terms of a transaction. 
There’s no certainty that the discussions will result in a transaction, the company added.

In conjunction with the HOC, which kicked off in January, chief marketing and sales officer Gerard Yuen (pic) said Sime Darby Property has kicked off a campaign where it is launching eight projects in eight weeks.
“We will be offering 1,200 units worth RM817mil within an eight-week period,” he told StarBiz in an interview.
The campaign, called Primetime 8, began in March and will end later this month. 
After just four weeks, 519 units worth RM305mil have already been book, said Yuen.
“Over the four-week period, we have launched three new projects and previewed one. Two of the projects that we launched have been fully taken up.”
Meanwhile, 73% of Serenia Adiva, the developer’s third project launched, has been taken up.
“The HOC will serve as an impetus for us to drive our sales,” said Yuen.
Most of the units being offered under Sime Darby Property’s Primetime 8 campaign are located within the Klang Valley.
The developer will be following up its eight-week campaign with another campaign where units from all over the country will be showcased.
Sime Darby Property changed its financial year-end to Dec 31 from June 30 previously. 
The group achieved a 7.9% rise in revenue to RM1.27bil for the six-month period until the end of last year mainly due to improved performance of its property development and concession arrangement segments.
Net earnings showed a loss of RM318.7mil as a result of the current period’s impairments, negative contribution from the Battersea project and higher tax provisions.
AmInvestment Bank Research in a recent report said it was maintaining its “hold” recommendation on Sime Darby Property with a lower fair value of RM1.06, based on a 45% discount to revalued net asset value.
“We cut our 2019 and 2020 net profit forecasts by 18.1% and 32.7% respectively to reflect the timing of revenue recognition and imputing lower margins, while introducing our 2021 net profit forecast at RM359.4mil.”
The government has announced a number of initiatives in conjunction with the six-months HOC, such as the exemption of stamp duties residential units priced between RM300,000 and RM1mil.
These are only for properties of developers that are participating in the HOC.
For houses sold above RM1mil to RM2.5mil, stamp duty exemption applies for the first RM1mil, and the rest will be charged at 3%.
Previously, a 1% stamp duty fee was imposed on buyers for the first RM100,000 of the purchase consideration; 2% for RM100,001 to RM500,000 and 3% from RM500,001 to RM1mil.
Stamp duty on loan agreements for properties up to RM2.5mil would be exempted, compared with the previous rate of 0.5%."

Four years on, it’s finally happening.
OUE Commercial REIT said on Monday it had agreed to buy OUE Hospitality Trust to create one of Singapore’s 10 biggest REITs, giving the combined entity greater firepower to make acquisitions. It’s also the city-state’s first merger among REITs of different asset classes. (Last year, Warburg Pincus LLC-backed ESR-REIT and Viva Industrial Trust merged to create a larger logistics trust.)
“The ESR-Viva merger set a template for future mergers,” said Vijay Natarajan, an analyst at RHB Research Institute Singapore Pte. “We could see more such mergers of smaller players as the REIT markets still remain favorable.”
Larger REITs have outperformed smaller ones so there may be tie-ups among the smaller industrial and hotel trusts as they seek to consolidate and attract some of the fund flows going into their larger peers, he said.
The OUE merger will create a group with S$6.8bil of assets - including Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, One Raffles Place and Mandarin Orchard Singapore - making it the city-state’s eighth-largest S-REIT, according to Monday’s statement.
“The proposed combination of OUE Commercial Trust and OUE Hospitality Trust is a bold step but potentially a necessary one in an era where ‘big is beautiful’ among the Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts,” analysts led by Mervin Song at DBS Group Holdings Ltd wrote in a note. 
The larger and more liquid group “will likely place it on the radar of a wider pool of institutional investors, and potentially result in greater broker coverage.”
Potential merger candidates could include some trusts that are below S$1bil in market value, analysts said.
Being eligible for inclusion in benchmark indexes was also a reason behind the OUE merger.

According to Cypark group chief executive officer Datuk Daud Ahmad, the company plans to bid for a capacity of 100 megawatt (MW) under LSS3. Cypark is in the final stages of finalising its bid prior to submission.
He said the potential revenue from the LSS3 project would be “a significant boost” to the group’s future topline. For context, Cypark recorded a total revenue of RM337.88mil in the financial year ended Oct 31, 2018.
“As the renewable energy (RE) leader in Malaysia, Cypark considers itself the cost leader in the RE segment. We are also well-positioned to successfully tender for the RE project.
“Under the LSS1 and LSS2, we have a good success rate. We believe that if we continue with our efforts to make our costs competitive, we are confident that our chance to secure the project would be higher,” Daud told reporters after Cypark’s AGM here yesterday. 
Cypark had won two solar farm projects under the previous LSS1 scheme and they are currently under construction. Under the second round of the LSS scheme, the company had clinched three more projects.
Earlier this year, it was reported that the competitive bidding process for LSS3 would be open for a six-month period until August. Under the LSS3 scheme, the government will tender out a solar energy capacity of between one MW and 100MW, with a target aggregate capacity of 500MW in Peninsular Malaysia.
The projects are in addition to ongoing LSS projects to produce 958MW of electricity between the end of this year and 2020.
On the status of Cypark’s waste-to-energy (WTE) plant, Daud said it is expected to be completed and commissioned in June this year.“The WTE plant will start contributing to our revenue from June upon completion. On a full-year basis, we are expecting about RM80mil in revenue from the plant.
“We have spent about RM500mil for the development of the WTE plant. It will be an important component of our business since it will deliver a stable recurring income for the group,” he said.
Cypark’s WTE plant, which is located in Ladang Tanah Merah, Negri Sembilan, is the first of its kind in Malaysia.
This facility will be able to produce 25MW of power from handling solid waste disposal and has the ability to increase capacity in the future.
“Our plant uses one of the world’s best technologies in the WTE scene. In fact, the technology is provided by Hitachi Zosen, which has built the most number of WTE plants in the world,” he said.
Moving forward, Daud remained optimistic that Cypark would be able to continue recording double-digit revenue growth, given the government’s increased push for RE initiatives. The company’s RE business segment is expected to become the dominant revenue contributor.
Currently, Cypark’s order book is valued at about RM600mil, with most of the contracts from the group’s environment engineering segment. Tender book-wise, Daud said the company has bid for over RM1bil in contract value and more than 90% of the projects are based in Malaysia."

G3 said that through the collaboration, it would promote, manage and execute all business development activities  for the products and technologies of SenseTime within Malaysia. 
“SenseTime, on the other hand, would provide its industry expertise and knowledge which includes technology and technical support, products and technology training and periodic updates on its AI technologies to G3,” the statement stated.
G3’s Puan said: “Today, AI has changed the way we live and the way we do our business. AI is now used to analyse and understand users’ behaviour. 
“We are indeed excited to collaborate and partner with SenseTime, as we can leverage on each other’s strengths to develop AI-based technologies which add value to the digital offerings that we currently have.”
Incorporated in 2014, SenseTime focuses on innovative computer vision, deep learning and AI for text, vehicle and facial recognition, SenseTime has collaborated with many strategic partners and clients, serving about 400 companies and government agencies including Honda, UnionPay, Xiaomi, OPPO and Weibo.
The statement said G3 and SenseTime would embark on some key strategic opportunities in areas like national safety, security, surveillance, immigration, border security system, Know Your Customer (KYC), access control, smart mobility and connected vehicles.
G3 and SenseTime will also be working on developing curriculum for AI courses to be offered in Malaysia. 
Bloomberg recently reported that SenseTime planned to sustain growth by expanding globally and diving deeper into arenas from autonomous cars to healthcare. The report also said that SenseTime, which counts Alibaba Group as one of its investors, is looking to raise another US$2bil in fresh funding this year. 
It raised more than US$1.2bil last year, including a round announced in May that valued it at more than US$4.5bil. The funding came from firms including Fidelity International, Silver Lake Partners and Hopu Capital."

All three major U.S. stock indexes finished the session in the red, with the S&P 500 ending its eight-day rally.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on $11 billion of European goods, raising tensions over aircraft subsidies that threaten to morph into a wider trade war.

""The European tariff thing caught people by surprise, just as we were working through the China (trade) issues,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trade disputes, along with Britain's potentially messy exit from the European Union, led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut its global economic growth forecasts and warn that further cuts could follow.

""With the IMF ... you're getting two data points that indicate that things may soften up over the next several months,"" Tuz added. ""It gives some people reason enough to take money off the table.""

""(But) we're right on the cusp of earnings season which could change everything.""

First-quarter earnings season is set to begin in earnest, with Delta Airlines reporting on Wednesday and JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co results due on Friday, kicking off what analysts now expect to be the first quarter to show a year-on-year decline in profits since 2016.

January-March earnings for S&P 500 companies are now seen falling by 2.5% from last year, according to Refinitiv data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190.44 points, or 0.72%, to 26,150.58, the S&P 500 lost 17.57 points, or 0.61%, to 2,878.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.61 points, or 0.56%, to 7,909.28.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/standard-chartered-to-pay-us$1pt1b-for-sanctions-violations/,Standard Chartered to pay US$1.1b for sanctions violations,Corporate News,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",8:10 AM MYT,"WASHINGTON: Standard Chartered Plc has agreed to pay US$1.1 billion to U.S. and British authorities for conducting illegal financial transactions that violated sanctions against Iran and other countries, government authorities announced on Tuesday.

The settlement by the London-based bank is among the most severe imposed for sanctions violations, some of which occurred not long after Standard Chartered settled similar charges in 2012.

""The circumstances that led to today's resolutions are completely unacceptable"" and ""not representative"" of the bank today, Group Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement.

Tuesday's settlement extends by two years a deferred prosecution agreement that Standard Chartered originally entered in 2012.

A former Standard Chartered banker in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates pleaded guilty in a New York state court to sanctions-related violations, authorities also said, while an Iranian customer was criminally charged by federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C.

Standard Chartered ""undermined the integrity of our financial system and harmed our national security by deliberately providing Iranians with coveted access to the U.S. economy,"" Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu said.

The agreements resolve an investigation that began into Standard Chartered's banking for Iran-controlled entities in Dubai. The investigation began roughly five years ago.

The bank paid U.S. authorities $667 million in 2012 for illegally moving millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on behalf of customers in Iran, Sudan, Libya and Myanmar, some of the same countries involved in the latest settlement.

In 2014, it paid another $300 million to the New York's Department of Financial Services after a monitor uncovered shortcomings in the bank's surveillance systems.

In a statement on Tuesday, Standard Chartered said it accepted responsibility for the violations, which stopped after 2014. The bank also said it had cooperated in the investigations.

The latest penalty is a tally of fines and forfeitures imposed by U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

U.S. authorities will receive $928 million of the penalties, with roughly half of that going to New York.

The FCA imposed a 102 million pound fine ($133 million) on the bank for its control failures. It noted Standard Chartered's lax controls in opening an account with 3 million UAE Dirham in cash in a suitcase (just over 500,000 pounds) and said the bank failed to get sufficient information about a customer exporting a product with potential military applications.

New York's DFS said the misconduct involved $600 million in illegal dollar transactions between 2008 and 2014 that moved through the state from the bank's London and Dubai offices.

Another $20 million in U.S. dollar payments were tied to illegal transactions involving Syrian, Sudanese, Burmese and Cuban entities, the New York regulator said.

After bank employees found that dozens of clients used an internet platform to access U.S. dollar accounts from Iran, bank compliance officers failed to take steps to ensure the transactions were blocked, New York’s regulator said.

Payments from Iran through a fax in the Dubai branch also were not halted, and a manager told an Iranian front company how to evade detection by changing its name and opening a new account, the regulator said.

New York will ensure ""the bank lives up to its word and maintains effective safeguards,"" said Acting New York Financial Services Superintendent Linda Lacewell. As part of its deal, an independent consultant will continue to oversee the bank's remediation efforts, the regulator said.

Standard Chartered also agreed to enter into amended deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. Justice Department and the Manhattan District Attorney for conspiring to violate sanctions and falsifying New York business records. The agreements now run through April 2021.

The bank had been operating under a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities since the 2012 settlement.

The agreement has been extended numerous times, most recently for 10 days and set to expire on Wednesday.

Standard Chartered said in February it had set aside $900 million for the potential resolution of violations of U.S. sanctions and foreign exchange trading. That sum also included the FCA penalty.

Standard Chartered's penalty is well below the $8.9 billion imposed by U.S. authorities in 2014 on BNP Paribas for conspiring to evade sanctions. The 10 banks penalized for similar conduct over the past decade also include France's Credit Agricole, which paid $787 million in 2015, and Amsterdam-based ING Bank, $619 million in 2012.

The proposed class action filed in Chicago federal court seeks damages for alleged securities fraud violations, after Boeing's market value tumbled by $34 billion within two weeks of the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX.

Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg and Chief Financial Officer Gregory Smith were also named as defendants.

Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers had no immediate comment.

According to the complaint, Boeing ""effectively put profitability and growth ahead of airplane safety and honesty"" by rushing the 737 MAX to market to compete with Airbus SE , while leaving out ""extra"" or ""optional"" features designed to prevent the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.

It also said Boeing's statements about its growth prospects and the 737 MAX were undermined by its alleged conflict of interest from retaining broad authority from federal regulators to assess the plane's safety.

Richard Seeks, the lead plaintiff, said Boeing's compromises began to emerge after the Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 onboard, five months after the Lion Air crash killed 189.

Seeks said he bought 300 Boeing shares in early March, and sold them at a loss within the last two weeks. The lawsuit seeks damages for Boeing stock investors from Jan. 8 to March 21.

Shareholders often file lawsuits accusing companies of securities fraud for concealing material negative information that causes the stock price to decline upon becoming public. 

Chicago-based Boeing faces many other lawsuits over the crashes, including by victims' families and by participants in its employee retirement plans.

Boeing said on Tuesday that aircraft orders in the first quarter fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier, with no orders for the 737 MAX following the worldwide grounding.

On April 5, it said it planned to cut monthly 737 production to 42 planes from 52, and was making progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents.

At 9.23 am, the local unit was traded at 4.0970/1020 against the greenback from Tuesday's close of  4.0920/0960.

SPI Asset Management head of trading and market strategy Stephen Innes said trade tensions between the European Union and the US as well as the lower crude oil prices would keep the ringgit trading in a tight range today.

Brent crude was at US70.51 per-barrel last night, down by 59 cents.

He also said the ringgit should be the beneficiary of improving Asean's higher domestic commodity prices, resulting in an improving current account balance.

""But the combination of dovish global central banks and moderate domestic inflation does open the door to a preemptive Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) policy easing.

""But from my chair, there are few if any potent arguments from the BNM to ease, outside of moderate inflation, given the nascent revival in the global reflation trade as the US Federal Reserve and People's Bank of China are helping the global economy by doing the lions share of the heavy lifting,”said Innes in a note today.

Meanwhile, the ringgit traded mostly lower against a basket of major currencies.

It eased against the Singapore dollar to 3.0258/0300 from 3.0246/0280 and weakened against the Japanese yen to 3.6853/6902 from 3.6772/6818.

Chinese investment under the five-year-old Belt and Road Initiative presented seven challenges, analysts led by Daniel Kliman wrote in the report this week. 
Therefore participating nations should ask questions in those areas, such as “will the project significantly involve local companies and labour and transfer skills?” or “is the project structured to minimise bribery risk and opportunities for corruption?,” they wrote.
The analysts reviewed 10 Chinese infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative across Asia, Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific islands to generate the list of challenges and the respective challenges.

The reductions include close to 1,200 positions at the global banking and investor solutions division, which houses its trading activities, the CGT union of SocGen’s French employees said earlier, citing a briefing by the bank. About 750 jobs will be cut in France, SocGen said.
SocGen’s GBIS unit has more than 20,000 employees worldwide. Revenue at the trading unit plunged 19 % in the fourth quarter, capping a disappointing year. 
Bloomberg News reported Friday that SocGen plans to cut about 700 jobs in Paris and eliminate hundreds more positions in London and New York, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
The bank also said it plans to close its over-the-counter commodities business and its proprietary trading subsidiary and will reorganize and refocus activities in rates, credit, currencies and prime services businesses to make them more profitable.
“This news confirms that management is on a target to deliver the plan; however, the focus at Q1 results will be on the group solvency position,” Jefferies analysts Maxence Le Gouvello Du Timat and Martina Matouskova said in a note.
The French bank has declined by 40% in Paris trading in the last 12 months, compared with a 23% decline by the Euro STOXX Banks Index. The shares are down 4.8% this year.
The reductions will mostly focus on fixed-income trading. Businesses with poor profitability are on the chopping block as Oudea battles to preserve SocGen’s leadership in equity derivatives.
The move by SocGen comes as some rivals indicated that challenging trading conditions are persisting in 2019.

In particular, all ethylene chain chemicals are exhibiting severe weakness due to the abundance of US exports into the region, according to Maybank Investment Bank Research. 
However, it believes that that petrochemical prices should trend higher going forward as consumers need to restock inventories and drive production. 
“There is no change to our earnings forecast  with a hold call and target price of RM9.05 based on 8.4 times FY19 EV/EBITDA which is a 10% premium to peers,” it said in a research note issued yesterday.  
Global petrochemical prices have been on a declining trend since late 4Q18. 
This was due to the decline in crude oil prices, US-China trade war spat, and uncertainties stemming from the Iranian sanctions and the impending Brexit - or not.
“We estimate Petronas Chemicals’s 1Q19 ASP to be at RM3,202 a tonne (minus 7.4% year on year, minus 13.6% quarter on quarter),” it said. 
Maybank Research said there were two scheduled maintenance shutdowns in the quarter and this will depress utilisation rate to high 80% levels (1Q18 was 100%). 
“Based on these assumptions, we estimate a core net profit of RM970mil ( minus 9% year on year,  minus 25% quarter on quarter) in 1Q19.  
“We are of the view that the current weak petrochemical prices are due to geopolitical uncertainty. 
“The underlying demand should still be healthy underpin by global GDP-growth. 
“We gather from industry players that major consumers are buying on consignment and keeping inventories at a minimum,” it said.
Maybank Research said at some point in time, consumers need to re-stock and this could potentially happen in the second and third quarters. 
This should support higher and more stable petrochemical prices."

The research house said that it, however, remained cautious about the extent to which these companies will benefit, due to several factors. 
It noted that the tax, which comes into effect on January 1, 2020, could benefit media companies with TV and over-the-top (OTT) segments such as Astro , Media Prima and Star Media Group, which have seen their subscription revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) impacted due to competition from international OTT players such as Netlfix. “However, we are cautiously optimistic on this development as it still remains to be seen the extent to which the tax will benefit local players,” it said in a note.
One of the reasons for this, is due to Malaysia’s digital tax rate being lower than the rates in New Zealand, Russia and Norway at 15%, 18% and 25% respectively, according to Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Amiruddin Hamzah. “Furthermore, pricing alone might not deter customers from choosing preferred content provided by foreign OTT players,” it said. The digital service tax was set at a fixed rate of 6% per year, with an annual threshold of RM500,000 following the passing of the Service Tax (Amendment) 2019 Bill in Parliament.
The move by the government is aimed at levelling the playing field between local and international online service providers, as the digital tax is expected to benefit local media companies with TV and over-the-top (OTT) segments.
Under the Bill, tax defaulters face a fine of up to RM50,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three years upon conviction.
A foreign service provider is defined as a person outside Malaysia providing digital services to consumers and includes any person operating an online platform for buying and selling goods or providing services (whether or not such person provides anydigital service).
The Bill describes a digital service, meanwhile, as a service delivered or subscribed over the internet and other electronic network and which cannot be obtained without the use of information technology and where the delivery of the service is essentiallyautomated.
“We maintain our neutral stance on the media sector due its unexciting prospects amid a challenging operating environment following the structural shift from traditional media to digital platforms, coupled with the challenging monetisation of digital initiatives and a subdued adex outlook for 2019,” the research house said in a note yesterday."

The firm questioned both the way the pay rise was made public as well as the rationale behind it. Thiam, who delivered Credit Suisse’s first annual profit in four years, saw his 2018 compensation last year rise about 30% to 12.7 million Swiss francs (US$12.7mil), largely to make up for earlier reductions to his long-term bonuses in response to shareholder discontent. 
The firm recommended shareholders vote in favour of his short-term incentive, though cautioned on other aspects of his pay including a high fixed salary.
“This resolution appears of a particularly sensitive nature at this time, following the past expressions of criticism on the board’s poor exercise of discretion,” Glass Lewis said in a report. 
“Shareholders should reasonably expect cautious behaviors by the compensation committee, in an effort to rebuild investors’ trust.”
Previous conflicts between the bank and its shareholders over pay had subsided after the executive board took a voluntary pay cut last year. Without that cut, Thiam’s pay increase for 2018 would have been 13%, Credit Suisse said last month.
While Swiss pension-fund adviser Ethos also issued a negative opinion ahead of the April 26 shareholder meeting, there is some support for the pay rises. ISS said investors should approve the proposals because the bank provided a justification and “uses repurchased shares to settle equity awards.”
In addition, “the company has implemented several positive improvements over the past years and the compensation framework as a whole remains broadly in line with market practice,” ISS said in a note.
Credit Suisse posted three consecutive annual losses before returning to profit last year following a sweeping restructuring programme led by Thiam. The executive pivoted the bank to wealth management, cut costs and raised more than 10 billion francs in fresh equity to fund the restructuring.
While acknowledging the net profit posted in 2018, Glass Lewis said some key indicators “performed below the median of country and industry peers.” Also, the shares declined during the period and Thiam’s base salary “is already significantly above peers,” it said.
Sergio Ermotti, who leads larger competitor at UBS Group AG, earned 14.1 million francs last year, down from 14.2 million francs in 2017. 
Outside Switzerland, banking CEOs generally earn much less. Societe Generale SA paid Frederic Oudea about 2.4 million euros (US$2.7mil) last year, while Deutsche Bank AG’s Christian Sewing earned about 7 million euros.
The CEO’s base salary “represents the basis for short- and long-term incentives, which will yield substantial payouts in the next years if the restructuring program will prove successful,” Glass Lewis said. — Bloomberg"

In issuing the list, which includes goods ranging from jetliners and passenger helicopters to cheese, wine, ski-suits and motorcycles, the US Trade Representative’s office cited the World Trade Organisation’s finding that aid to Airbus has “repeatedly” caused “adverse effects to the United States.”
The USTR said in its statement on Monday evening that the Trump government will immediately begin a process under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to “identify products of the EU to which additional duties may be applied until the EU removes those subsidies.”
The threatened tariffs, which come after the WTO ruled in May that Airbus had received illegal funding for its A380 and A350 models, costing Boeing sales, would be implemented only after the WTO gave the final go-ahead this summer, the administration said, marking a rare show of faith in an institution that Trump himself has assailed.
Shares of Toulouse, France-based Airbus fell as much as 2.3%, the biggest drop in 2½ weeks, before trading 1.7% lower as of 9:19 am in Paris. Aerospace suppliers including Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and Meggitt Plc were also priced lower.
The US move is provocative on a number of fronts. Washington said it would impose the tariffs under the same previously dormant trade statute that it has used to justify duties on China over the past year.
The threat also comes just as the EU’s members are in the final stages of negotiating the terms of a mandate for the European Commission, its executive arm, to begin talks on industrial tariffs with the Trump administration. The new action may therefore further complicate those contacts.
The proposed measures are relatively minor compared with the US’s ongoing trade war with China, in which the two sides have imposed tariffs on about US$360bil of each other’s goods in the past nine months. But they mark a significant escalation in tensions with the EU, which has implemented retaliatory duties on €2.8bil  of US imports following Trump’s trade restrictions on foreign steel and aluminum.
Some EU members, led by France, are already skeptical of the value of negotiations with the US, which were agreed to last July in a bid by the EU to avoid auto tariffs Trump has threatened. Furthermore, a draft of the mandate seen by Bloomberg specifically gives the EU an opt-out if the US were to impose tariffs on the bloc using the Section 301 justification.
Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, said in a statement on Monday night that the US had lost patience with what is now one of the WTO’s longest running sagas.
“This case has been in litigation for 14 years, and the time has come for action,” he said in the statement. — Bloomberg"

Ashley, the chief executive officer of Sports Direct International Plc, boosted his offer to underwrite new funding for the department-store chain by £50mil (US$65mil), to £200mil. But Debenhams said conditions for an agreement with Ashley, who has also been considering a takeover bid, have not been met. Debenhams’ shares have been suspended from trading.
Debenhams said in a statement that it’s on track toward a debt restructuring deal with creditors that would wipe out equity, including Sports Direct’s roughly 30% stake. The latest twist takes the retailer one step closer to a so-called pre-packaged administration where lenders will take control. 
Ashley has been embroiled for months in a battle with Debenhams lenders over the retailer, which is seeking to restructure £720mil of debt. 
Debenhams gave Ashley an ultimatum last month to commit to a restructuring on creditors’ terms or risk completely losing his investment in a prepack administration.
The company is under pressure to close stores and reduce costs as part of a wider crisis in UK retail that’s claimed household names from department-store owner BHS to the UK arm of Toys “R” Us Inc. 
Debenhams has struggled to develop its online business as consumers shift purchases to Amazon.com Inc and other e-commerce providers, with Brexit-related jitters hitting spending.
Debenhams’ lenders, including US hedge funds, have been in the driving seat in negotiations since extending a lifeline in February. They are withholding £99mil of funding from the company, which will likely only be made available in a pre-pack administration.
Sports Direct said separately that it’s still considering a cash offer that would value the retailer’s equity at about £61mil. Ashley has sweetened his financing proposal from Monday by asking lenders to write off £82mil of debt rather than £148mil. 
However, his plan is still contingent on him being named chief executive officer, a requirement that has been a sticking point in the past. — Bloomberg"

Kenanga Research, in a note, said it remains cautious on Fortis in terms of additional findings which could pose risks in terms of provisions. 
It added that moving forward, IHH faces tough operating conditions due to the uncertain Turkish Lira and execution risk at Fortis as well as uncertainty over its turnaround timeline. This comes on the back of an analyst briefing held by IHH to dispel investors’ concerns with regards to auditors’ latest qualified opinion on its 31.1% stake in Fortis.
According to Kenanga, IHH does not see significant risk from the qualified opinion in terms of additional provisions. 
“IHH explained that steps and measures have been taken which include review and improve financial reporting processes and enhancing authorisation levels for payments or transfer of funds within the Fortis Group. 
“With the blessings from Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Fortis has taken steps to recover dues from former controlling shareholders of Fortis to the tune of RM265mil to RM275mil of which the group is confident of recovering,” said Kenanga.
Kenanga added that IHH has initiated an independent forensic audit on Fortis Group’s operations, expected to be completed before end-2019.
IHH is awaiting Bank Negara’s formal approval to recapitalise US$250mil existing subordinated loans to help reduce the non-cash forex loss related to non-Turkish Lira borrowings.
The group is also looking to refinance the remaining US$430mil in debt denominated in USD and Euro by swapping 50% of the sum into local Turkish Lira and the remainder to be refinanced into either US dollar or euro.
“While we see the repayment of the entire non-Turkish Lira debt as a positive, which is expected to reduce swings in forex translation, this, however, comes with the drawback of a higher interest rate,” said Kenanga.
The research house maintained its “underperform” recommendation on IHH and target price of RM5.15.
Meanwhile AmResearch said it is negative on the development as there is a risk of impairments which would impact the groups’ financial statements. 
The provisional goodwill accounted for Fortis in FY18 is RM1.5bil. 
“Moreover, on the company level, there was a RM2.3bil charge on the company’s profit or loss based on the impairment assessment on its Turkey investment as it faces the risk of a depreciation of the Turkish lira.

The order book is likely to be the largest ever seen in emerging markets, covering many times the US$10bil to US$15bil Aramco is expected to raise. It’s a sign of investors’ hunger for yield in a world where bonds from some developed nations have negative interest rates.
“This deal should do extremely well,” said Anthony Simond, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc In London. 
“The company appeals to more than one type of investor. Firstly emerging market debt funds and secondly global investment grade investors.”
The bond sale is largely seen as Plan B to raise money for the kingdom’s economic agenda after the initial public offering of Aramco was postponed until at least 2021 from an initial 2018 target. 
In effect, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Salman, who runs the country day-to-day, is using the state oil producer’s pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions.
For Saudi Arabia, the strong demand for the debt of its state oil company will comfort the country’s wealthy royal family, which has been in crisis mode since the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October. The murder, which US intelligence concluded was ordered by Prince Mohammed himself, triggered a global uproar that prompted Wall Street banks, investors and business tycoons to give the kingdom a cold shoulder.
Political turnaround
An investment summit in Riyadh that month dubbed “Davos in the Desert” was mostly boycotted by its A-list participants. Yet, little by little, the power of money has attracted Wall Street again, first at the real World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where bank bosses said it was time to let the kingdom out of the penalty box. And later in the bond market itself, where the Saudi government successfully raised debt this year.
The Aramco bond sale will be final confirmation of the turnaround for the Middle Eastern nation. The company told investors it would sell debt in six portions, from three to 30 years, according to the people familiar with the matter.
“The market shows no signs of wishing to balk at the latent political risk attached to Saudi,” said Anthony Peters, a strategist at Blockex Ltd.
In a rare development for a state-owned company, Aramco could be on track to pay less for its debt than the Saudi government, the same people said, asking not to be named before the bond pricing later on Tuesday.
The anticipated low pricing and strong order book underscores the financial strength of the world’s largest – and most profitable – oil company. In the last few months, only companies such as telecommunications and media conglomerate Comcast Corp and pharmaceutical giant CVS Health Corp have drawn similar, or larger, interest from investors. Comcast attracted US$88bil in orders in 2018, while CVS peaked at what’s consider a record for any company: US$121bil.
With strong demand, Aramco told investors it expects to pay about 1.25 percentage points more than US Treasuries for its 10-year notes, compared with Saudi sovereign bonds trading at about 1.27 percentage points. Traditionally, those risk premiums fall in a high-demand bond sale as the process advances, suggesting Aramco may pay even less.Investors will be watching closely to see how much the pricing tightens at the next stage of the process. Such has been the massive response to the deal, the company has opted not to give any further price indications until after the book has closed, which is due around 11am London time.
This isn’t the first time Saudi Arabia has turned to debt markets since the death of Khashoggi. In January, the nation sold US$7.5bil in international bonds, the first sign that the outcry hadn’t stifled foreign investors’ interest in the country.

Aramco has lined up a roster of international banks supporting its jumbo bond deal, another indication of how the mood in Wall Street toward the kingdom has changed. The banks not only want to participate on the bond sale, but also ensure they’re well placed in case Aramco goes ahead with its planned IPO.
Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s chief executive officer, spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to one person familiar with the matter. Last year, Dimon and others skipped the investment conference in Riyadh, but still sent senior bankers to make sure they kept their contacts with the kingdom.
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are managing the bond sale along with Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc, and NCB Capital Co. An order book as large as US$85bil indicates that many investors that shunned “Davos in the Desert” are also planning to buy the bonds.
The bond sale, being pitched to investors over the last week in a global roadshow from Tokyo to New York and London, has forced Aramco to reveal financial and operational secrets held closely since the company’s nationalization in the late 1970s, shedding a light on the relationship between the kingdom and its most important asset.
Both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service assigned Aramco the fifth-highest investment-grade rating, the same as Saudi sovereign debt, but lower than oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/malaysia-expected-to-meet-49-gdp-growth/,Malaysia expected to meet 4.9% GDP growth,Economy,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is expected to meet its gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 4.9% despite the challenges it faces.
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said factors backing this confidence in the economy included the positive effect of implicit stimulus financed by the RM37bil refunds for the goods and services tax and the income tax.
As at end-February, the government had returned RM7.9bil to business taxpayers.
Lim said these refunds would provide businesses and individuals with additional cash, which would improve the outlook for spending and investment growth.
Other international bodies and institutions were not as optimistic on Malaysia’s GDP expansion.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast 4.7%, Bloomberg 4.5% and Moody’s Investors Service, a 4.4% growth. Even Bank Negara has taken a cautious forecast of between 4.3% and 4.8%.
Lim added that the government was seeking to increase SMEs’ contribution to GDP to 41% by 2020, compared to 37% in 2017. “The government is also targeting to raise SMEs’ contribution to total exports to 23% by 2020 from 18% in 2017.
“We have allocated RM17.9bil for SME development in Budget 2019, which is expected to ease access to financing, increase productivity, raise the level of human capital, reduce the cost of doing business and hasten the adoption of technology,” he said in his speech at the 24th Credit Guarantee Corp SME Awards 2018.
Lim urged SMEs to seize opportunities from the unresolved trade war between the United States and China. He added that a huge chunk of approved foreign direct investment came from China and the US, which indicated Malaysia’s role as a safe haven in a global trade war.
Meanwhile, speaking to reporters after the event, Lim clarified that the proposed departure levy of RM20 for Asean countries and RM40 for non-Asean countries was only applicable to air travel.
Those who are performing the haj or umrah for the first time will be exempted from the levy.
The government is still deciding on the rate and Lim said it is expected to be imposed after Hari Raya Haji.
He also said that cost-saving measures undertaken by the government have “disappeared” as it now needed to bail out debt-laden organisations such as Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH) and Felda.
“As a government, we have to support both Felda and TH where the previous government did everything wrong that caused such huge losses.
“The entire bailout for TH is around RM17.8bil over 10 years. We’ve looked at our finances. This is something we can manage. Many should be asking, how come TH lost so much money under the previous government?
“We have cut cost for projects like the MRT2 and LRT3. People are asking where all these savings went to. Now you know the answer,” said Lim."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/ecrl-lift-for-cpo/,ECRL lift for CPO?,Palm Oil,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The prospect of palm oil purchases to be included as part of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) renegotiation deal between Malaysia and China will be a boon for the local commodity’s outlook this year, say analysts. 
CGSCIMB described this development as “potentially positive” for the plantation sector as well as Malaysia’s trade and current account surplus. 
Palm oil makes up around 5.05 million tonnes or 58% of China’s edible oil imports. 
Of the total, Malaysia’s palm oil imports is around 1.92 million tonnes or 5% of China’s total edible oil consumption.
“If palm oil is part of the ECRL deal, the impact on crude palm oil (CPO) prices will depend on the volume committed by China.
“Should the deal involve higher palm oil sales volumes from Malaysia to China compared with 1.87 million tonnes in 2018, this will boost CPO prices via the drawdown of stocks,” the research unit said in its latest report.
Another point is whether the commitment will involve China using more palm oil at the expense of other edible oils.
“This scenario will be also be an overall positive for CPO prices due to higher global demand for palm oil.
“However, if the deal results in China maintaining its palm oil usage, but, increasing its share of palm oil purchases from Malaysia, it could potentially help widen the CPO price premium gap between local and Indonesia’s CPO prices,” added CGSCIMB.
In the event that the ECRL talks lead to higher CPO price, it pointed out that it will be positive for upstream planters and Malaysia’s current account surplus. 
The higher CPO prices would help boost the plantation companies’ earnings and/or defray the costs from higher minimum wage. 
Malaysia recorded a RM38.9bil in palm oil trade surplus in 2018, or 2.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). Hence, CGSCIMB said higher export volumes as a result of incremental demand from increased purchases by China could boost Malaysia’s trade and current account surplus. 
“We estimate that every 5% increase in palm oil export volumes, assuming palm oil prices remain constant, could raise the current account surplus by RM2bil or 0.14% of GDP.”  
On March 4, Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok witnessed the signing of four intent documents for the export of 1.62 million tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia to China with a combined value worth US$891mil. 
The documents were signed between three Chinese companies and four Malaysian companies. It is worth noting that Malaysia’s palm oil has been losing market share in China. 
The Malaysian Palm Oil Board statistics revealed that Malaysia’s share of total palm oil imports by China has declined from 76% in 2003 to only 38% in 2017. This could be due to stiff competition from Indonesian palm oil producers.
China is the third largest importer of Malaysia’s palm oil after India and the European Union.  
However, China’s share of Malaysia’s total palm oil exports has declined from 28% in 2007 to 11.6% in 2017."

That’s when prices remained steadily in backwardation, a market structure where near-term futures are costlier than later contracts – reflecting tight supplies in the present and ample barrels further out, analysts including Damien Courvalin wrote in a report.
The phenomenon may persist as Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) exits its current output cuts aimed at averting a global glut, adding supply back to the market in a move that would weigh on long-dated prices, Goldman said. That will maintain backwardation and lead US shale drillers to limit activity, according to the bank.
“We view this as the most compelling outcome for Opec, and the market structure most likely to be sustainable,” the analysts wrote in the report. “But having been waiting for this shift since 2016, we are not yet ready to base case it, even though the maturing shale producer landscape should eventually help achieve it.”
Goldman also raised its second-quarter forecast for global benchmark Brent crude to US$72.50 a barrel from US$65, and said a rally that’s taken prices over US$70 is reflective of a larger deficit than it predicted. Opec’s cuts, an acceleration in global economic activity, tighter US oil sanctions on producers such as Iran and an only moderate gain in shale production will continue to squeeze supplies through 2019, according to the bank.
Brent futures in London traded little changed at US$71.18 a barrel as of 12:50pm Singapore time yesterday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US benchmark, was up 0.2% at US$64.53 a barrel in New York.
While a risk-on investor sentiment and the threat of disruptions may drive spot prices even higher, Goldman expects them to decline gradually from this summer as production from shale fields and the Opec increases. “We therefore find more compelling opportunities for corporates and investors in timespreads, differentials and product cracks,” the analysts wrote.
Unlike last year, there is well identified global spare production capacity at the moment, the bank said. Further, new pipeline and export capacity will connect the Permian – the cheapest and largest shale basin in America – to the global market by this fall, according to Goldman. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/indias-us70bil-car-market-could-use-a-jump/,India’s US$70bil car market could use a jump,Business News,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",,"HEADING into an election, India’s enthusiasm for cars and motorbikes has all but evaporated. It’s unlikely to return anytime soon, despite all the grand promises to improve the lives of masses.
Passenger car sales, which have been sliding since last summer, fell another 6% last month while those for motorbikes - the larger and more profitable market - collapsed 15%.
Commercial vehicle sales, which include trucks and buses, also slowed. Overall production in the country’s US$70bil auto industry is slumping. Hero MotoCorp Ltd which commands a third of the market, posted a 20% drop.
This downbeat sentiment should worry investors and policymakers, particularly as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drums up nationalist pride. Inventories are piling up and consumers don’t feel like spending. With unemployment soaring, affordability remains a sticking point. 
That’s partly why India is largely a two-wheeler market, with annual sales of more than 20 million units compared with about four million for passenger vehicles.
True, there are lots of cars and motorbikes on the road in India - at close to 30 million and about 170 million, respectively. With more than one billion people and low levels of car ownership, this downturn may be a temporary blip given sales have grown at an average annual rate of 8% to 10% over the past five years.
So why is demand this tepid? Because buyers just can’t spend. That’s particularly the case among younger people, as well as those in rural and smaller urban areas. Hopes are high that Modi’s manifesto will double farmers’ income and create opportunities for India’s youth (which his government thus far has failed to do). Both are unlikely.
Even for those who have money to spend, their choices are, well, boring. Most cars look and feel the same, with models made by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co dominating the roads. Fancier cars remain inaccessible. On top of that, congestion and pollution are becoming a real menace.
Consumers’ apathy has spread to manufacturers. Despite heavy government protection with import duties, margins are shrinking and companies aren’t re-investing much.
While India’s auto sector has outperformed the benchmark stock index for the past decade, it has under-performed by more than 25% since July, Bernstein Bernstein analysts note.   
Until cars become more affordable, demand will waver. One way around this is to boost auto financing. But that’s already a well-trodden path: Such loans already back around 70% of passenger car buyers and 50% of the two-wheeler market, according to Bernstein.
Meanwhile, other outlays continue to pile up. Fuel is expensive and the upfront cost of insurance is also set to rise because of new rules that went into effect in September. With high interest rates, it’s probably imprudent for borrowing to outpace income gains. Consumers aren’t feeling wealthy, and there isn’t much incentive for them to buy.
Going into previous election cycles, the promise of certainty and a dedicated government has driven sales in the auto sector. This time, it won’t matter if Modi’s party returns - shoppers need to feel like they’ve got the power in their wallets. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/10/currencies-of-emerging-markets-flashing-a-warning/,Currencies of emerging markets flashing a warning,Business News,"Wednesday, 10 Apr 2019",,"SINGAPORE: The year has been great so far for risk assets from stocks to credit, and emerging-market assets have joined in the party. Except, recently, for their currencies.
Among the observations in a widening debate on the missing gains: some fund managers highlight their greater sensitivity to the risks of a global slowdown. 
The fact that these exchange rates have largely gone sideways since the end of January suggests continuing worries even as global equities build on their first-quarter surge.
Conversely, any pick-up in developing-nation exchange rates could be a good sign that the global appetite for risk is truly back in bullish mode. 
“I see two challenges for EM currencies,” said Pierre-Yves Bareau, head of emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management in London. “First, the US dollar is still rather strong. Secondly, the market needs to see more growth bottoming out to buy the 2018 growth laggards – like emerging markets.”
While bonds and stocks have been able to take heart from central banks’ shift away from policy normalisation, for the currency market, it’s going to take actual evidence of an acceleration in growth before a reaction occurs. That’s the thinking of Bryan Carter, head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management in London.
The very reason for the Fed’s about-face after all was the sluggish economic data and growing risk of a “growth shock,” Carter said. 
“We don’t see FX outperforming until the data in Europe and emerging markets convincingly demonstrate an upturn, and investors reset their forward growth expectations higher.”
Dirk Willer, head of emerging-market fixed income strategy at Citigroup Global Markets in New York, puts particular blame on the euro region, saying that a weak euro has held back a rally in a number of other currencies against the dollar. That in turn has stemmed in part from the slowdown in China, on which the region has increasingly relied. 
With better China purchasing manager indexes, “we may be able to look forward to a turn in eurozone data as well. The pessimism surrounding the euro may start to fade, removing a headwind for EM FX,” he said.
After a decade of easy money from the rich world’s central banks, developed-nation fund managers might have largely had their fill of emerging market currencies. It’s a phenomenon that Institute of International Finance analysts including chief economist Robin Brooks call “EM positioning overhang.” 
That’s why the Fed’s dovish pivot this year – which has helped stoke the rally in everything from stocks to corporate bonds – isn’t having such a big impact on some exchange rates, they argue.
IIF international portfolio tracking data show “the volume of flows to have been on a steadily declining trend for many years, with each successive dovish shift from the Fed less potent than the one before,” the group wrote last month.
Kiran Kowshik at UniCredit Bank AG said he and his colleagues “aren’t really convinced” by the “overhang” theory. Instead, he highlighted in an April 2 note that foreign-direct investment inflows (FDIs) “have stagnated at weaker levels” for emerging markets. FDI and current-account flows didn’t tend to shift quickly based on shifting central bank policies or global risk appetite, he noted.
The bigger problem is that emerging-market growth has suffered a structural slowdown in recent years, offering little incentive for developed-nation investors to pour in. 
Another flow dynamic to note: the moves that some current-account deficit countries took to reduce their vulnerabilities since the 2013 taper tantrum are largely done, he argued. — Bloomberg"

An initial offer of A$1.5 billion (us$1.1 billion) by the retail-to-chemicals conglomerate was previously rebuffed by Lynas' board, which termed the deal ""highly conditional"".

""Wesfarmers remains open to engage with the Lynas Board on our proposal, with a view to progressing a less conditional proposal,"" Managing Director Rob Scott said in a statement.

Wesfarmers' initial bid was subject to a range of conditions, including that Lynas has relevant operating licences in Malaysia for a ""satisfactory period"" following the close of the deal.

Lynas, which has an $800 million processing facility in Malaysia, is in a dispute with the Southeast Asian nation, which has told it to remove years of accumulated waste at its Malaysian processing plant in order to have its licence renewed.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/cloudy-credit-horizon-for-s$-bond-market-after-hyflux-default/,Cloudy credit horizon for S$ bond market after Hyflux default,Corporate News,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",11:21 AM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: S&P Global Ratings expects the credit horizon could be cloudy for the Singapore dollar (S$) bond market over the next 12-18 months after the default of a Singapore-based water infrastructure solutions provider, Hyflux Ltd.(unrated).

It said on Tuesday the default could be first wagon in a train of financial-distress cases to come as lending conditions adjust to the economic slowdown and become less favorable.

""We believe more defaults could occur in Singapore as earnings may be slowing down and investors becoming more selective,""  S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Bertrand Jabouley said.
 
""Due to very low rates and yields in the past five years, Singapore investors, both institutional and retail, have sometimes opted for riskier bonds, to increase cash returns.Lending appetite driven by abundant liquidity has allowed less-established, often smaller companies to tap the market. 

“Such players are typically more vulnerable to economic up and downs."" 

Given the global trading environment may not be as supportive as it used to be, a marked slowdown of earnings looks increasingly plausible.

This may be an issue in Singapore, where median leverage (debt-to-EBITDA ratio) is high at close to six times.

Hyflux announced recently it will restructure its outstanding bonds.

“We believe more distress situations are likely in Singapore.By our estimates, close to S$4bil (US$3bil) of Singapore-dollar corporate bonds are maturing by the end of 2019.

“That number climbs to some US$10 billion in 2020.A more cautious investor sentiment may exacerbate refinancing risk, in our view,” S&P said.

Besides these considerations on the wider market, the ratings agency see four interesting takeaways from the Hyflux situation. 

First, no sector is immune to financial troubles.
 
Distressed situations over the past two to three years in Singapore have been confined to the energy and commodity sectors following volatile prices (e.g.Swiber Holdings Ltd.and KrysEnergy Ltd. in 2016, or Ezion Holdings Ltd and Nam Cheong Ltd. in 2017).
 
However, the default of telecom services provider PT Trikomsel Oke Tbk in 2015 highlights that even companies in defensive sectors, widely understood as having sound resilience and growth potential, are vulnerable to financial distress and default risk if they rely heavily on debt for their expansion and do not appropriately manage their liquidity.

Second, situations can evolve quickly for companies with narrow or uncertain earnings quality.

This means lenders should do their due diligence before, and surveil their money after, investing.

Following some erratic operating performance in the previous years, Hyflux still managed to issue perpetual securities in May 2016.

Numbers at that time already suggested that the company's capital structure was hardly sustainable, with a ratio of net debt to EBITDA above 10 times in 2015 and negative EBITDA in 2014, driven by performance issues at the company's Tuaspring desalination and power plant.
 
After a rebound in 2016, with EBITDA of S$179 million, Hyflux posted a negative EBITDA in 2017 (S$68 million) and deepened its operating losses in 2018 (S$256 million in the nine months to end September).

On Sept. 30, 2018, short-term debt was S$508 million and cash S$194 million, making a capital structure revamp inevitable in light of the earnings momentum.
 
Third, losses can be harsh, depending on the characteristics of debt instruments outstanding. This is because the market has seen the introduction of complex debt instruments compared with senior unsecured notes.

In 2012 for instance, Genting Singapore PLC issued a total of S$2.3 billion in perpetual subordinated bonds in two separate tranches, S$1.8 billion for institutional and S$500 million for retail investors. These benchmark transactions have contributed to open the market for hybrid capital.

Out of close to S$60 billion in corporate bonds outstanding, there are about S$8 billion in perpetual bonds. 

Hyflux is seeking lender's consent to restructure S$2.8 billion of liabilities. 

As per the company's disclosures, senior lenders recovery should be limited and subordinated lenders may not recoup a cent, highlighting the higher credit risk they bear.

Fourth, it appears investors should not make assumptions regarding a given private company's importance to the government, and hence take a bailout as likely. 

In Singapore's Parliament on April 1, 2019, the Environment and Water Resources Minister announced that taxpayers' money would not alleviate the financial burden on beleaguered Hyflux.

This means that while water security is an important theme in Singapore, making Hyflux's role important to the country, it may not suffice to engender government support, in the absence of a strong link (i.e. ownership)."

A sale would mark an end to Crown 47% James Packer's 12-year foray into casinos after he re-badged his father's media empire as a gambling concern in 2007. Packer quit the Crown board last year due to mental illness.

For Wynn, the deal would give the world's second-largest casino company a foothold in a market popular with Chinese tourists, although a recent downturn in Chinese consumer spending has constrained Crown's revenue and share price.

""Pricewise, you'd be looking for a little bit more than this,"" said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut Ltd, a Crown shareholder.

""This is what appears to be the opening salvo.""

A sale along the lines propsoed by Wynn would be Australia's biggest M&A deal so far this year.

Crown shares jumped 21 percent to A$14.19, their biggest intraday gain since the company re-listed with its current name. Even so, they were still below the indicative buyout price of A$14.75 due to uncertainty about whether a deal would eventuate.

""It's a preliminary-style bid which doesn't yet provide an adequate premium for control, and most would expect there to be both more debate about the strategic merit and pricing,"" said Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management, which also holds Crown shares.

Crown said the talks with Wynn were at a preliminary stage and no agreement on value or structure had been reached.

Wynn was proposing to buy the company half in cash, half in shares, and the current proposal had not gone to the Crown board.

A Wynn spokesman declined to comment.

A spokesman for Consolidated Press Holdings, Packer's company which holds his Crown shares, was also not immediately available for comment.

RETREAT

The sale at the current proposed price would fetch about A$4.7 billion for Packer, who in addition to Crown quit 22 company directorships last year in a remarkable retreat for the scion of a family which had been a fixture of corporate Australia most of the 20th century.

The deal would also provide some relief for Crown shareholders, who have seen their investment go sideways since late 2016 when 18 of the company's staff were arrested in China for breaking laws banning casino marketing.

Crown has since pulled back from its Asia expansion plans - where it had competed with Wynn in the world's biggest gambling destination of Macau - and instead relied on high-rolling Chinese tourists at home to grow profit.

The deal would put Wynn in charge of one of Australia's most high profile developments, a A$2.2 billion luxury casino precinct called Barangaroo on the Sydney waterfront, which Crown has pitched as its future growth engine.

Wynn has properties in the United States and Macau, but over the past year it has ramped up promotion of a resort in Japan, a market seen as the next potential goldmine to Macau and a former expansion target for Crown.

The U.S. company has seen a series of shakeups following sexual misconduct claims against former CEO Steve Wynn. The company's largest shareholder, Elaine Wynn, who co-founded the firm with her ex-husband, is agitating for changes on the board. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/saudis-emerge-from-khashoggi-crisis-with-us$75bil-orders/,Saudis emerge from Khashoggi crisis with US$75bil orders,Corporate News,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",12:21 PM MYT,"DUBAI: Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, has received $75 billion in orders for its debut bond sale, kickstarting an offering with yields likely to fall in line or below Saudi Arabia’s sovereign debt.

It’s rare for bonds of a state-owned company to yield less than the sovereign debt and the demand reflects intense investor appetite for high-quality paper. 

For Saudi Arabia and Aramco itself, the early success in selling the bonds marks a tremendous turnaround after investors, Wall Street bankers and corporate titans briefly shunned the kingdom last year following the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The U.S. has blacklisted 16 Saudi nationals for their role in the Khashoggi murder, according to a statement Monday. The crisis, along with sliding crude prices, hit the kingdom late last year and in early 2019, with the economy slowing down and investors taking money out of the local stock market. 

Now, the situation appears to be reversing, helped by oil rising to more than $70 a barrel, up from $50 in December.

As part of its debut in the global debt market, Aramco has offered bonds in six portions, from three to 30 years, according to the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. 

Aramco is expected to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion, with final pricing and size anticipated on Tuesday afternoon London time.

The company expects to pay about 1.25 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries for its 10-year notes, compared with Saudi bonds trading at about 1.27 percentage points, the banks selling the debt told investors. Traditionally, those risk premiums fall in a high-demand bond sale as the process advances, suggesting Aramco may pay even less.

The Aramco deal is one of the most hotly anticipated debt deals of the year, marking the first time the Saudi oil giant has tapped the international bond market. 

When Qatar, a rival Middle East nation, sold $12 billion in bonds earlier this year, it got a record $50 billion in orders, evidence of investor appetite for debt of rich, oil-producing nations.

The order book for Aramco expanded from about $40 billion when the deal kicked off earlier Monday, people with knowledge of the deal said.

The deal is largely seen as Plan B to raise money for the country’s economic agenda after the initial public offering of Aramco, which had been slated for 2018, was postponed until at least 2021.

In effect, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is using the company’s pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions.

Aramco has lined up a roster of international investment banks supporting its jumbo bond deal, which suggests the mood around dealing with Saudi Arabia is changing as the impact of the Khashoggi crisis ebbs. 

The banks not only want to participate on the bond sale, but also ensure they’re well placed in case the kingdom goes ahead with an initial public offering for Aramco.

Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief executive officer, spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to one person familiar with the matter, a rare appearance that underlines the bond sale’s significance for Wall Street. 

Last year, Dimon and others skipped a global business conference in Riyadh, which had been dubbed the ""Davos in the Desert"".

Foreign Investment

This isn’t the first time Saudi Arabia has turned to debt markets since the death of Khashoggi. In January, the nation sold $7.5 billion in international bonds, showing that the outcry hasn’t stifled foreign investment in the country.

JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are managing the bond sale along with Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, and NCB Capital Co.

The bond sale, being pitched to investors over the last week in a global roadshow from Tokyo to New York and London, has forced Aramco to reveal financial secrets held closely since the company’s nationalization in the late 1970s, casting a light on the relationship between the kingdom and its most important asset. 

Both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service assigned Aramco the fifth-highest investment-grade rating, the same as Saudi sovereign debt, but lower than oil majors Exxon, Shell and Chevron Corp.

The state-owned company generated the most profit of any corporation in the world in 2018 with income of $111.1 billion -- more than Apple Inc., Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. combined. 

But accounts published before the firm’s debut in the international bond market also show Aramco -- an organiSation that produces about 10 percent of the world’s crude -- doesn’t generate as much cash per barrel as other leading oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell Plc because of a heavy tax burden.

Aramco is raising money as bond investors search for higher yields. Emerging-market bond sales have made a record-breaking start to the year, with issuance among all currencies already climbing above $600 billion, according to Bloomberg league table data.

The company plans to use some of the proceeds of the bond sale to pay for the $69 billion acquisition of a majority stake in local petrochemical company Sabic from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. 

The deal between three government-owned entities -- where the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund sells its 70 percent stake in Sabic to Aramco -- moves money from one pocket of the state to another. - Bloomberg"

The departures, part of Nomura’s plan announced last week to cut costs in its global trading and investment banking operations by $1 billion in coming years, are focused on the Japanese firm’s secondary business in fixed income, currencies and emerging markets. Chief Executive Officer Koji Nagai is pivoting toward what he calls “client-focused” business such as advisory, which tend to be less volatile. 

In the Americas, senior fixed-income strategists George Goncalves and Siobhan Morden are among those departing along with Lee Olive, co-head of leveraged finance, and top high-yield bond salesman Brian Lee, said the people, asking not to be named discussing personnel moves.

The Americas business will largely stop trading in both investment-grade and high-yield debt as part of the wider restructuring, which involves the loss of about 150 jobs across the U.S. and Europe. High-yield bond traders Vivek Raman and Andrew Leonhard are exiting, the people said, along with credit salesmen William Goebelbecker and Ben Golden.

Representatives for Nomura declined to comment. The departed employees either declined to comment or didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

In Europe, Dan Cohen, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa high-yield trading and Bilal Hafeez, Nomura’s head of G10 foreign-exchange and rates strategy, who writes a wellness newsletter, are leaving, the people said. Other European departures include:

Gokhan Buyuksarac, head of CEEMEA currencies,Asa Attwell, who oversaw Europe G10 currenciesAmanda Brilliant, who helped oversee repo businessClive Hadingham, head of Northern Europe FX sales.

In Asia, Graeme Bateman, 18-year veteran and head of Asia-Pacific research sales for Hong Kong and Neil Sheppard, a managing director in equity derivatives, are also leaving, the people said. Other exits include:

Ajay Abrol, a senior proprietary trader focused on macro tradingSean McDonough, a senior equity sales traderMike Yau, a head of portfolio trading.

Nomura’s operations outside Japan have lost money for four straight quarters, with Europe posing the biggest challenge for the firm. 

It isn’t the only investment bank struggling there: Low interest rates, sluggish economies and fierce competition have left European rivals including UBS Group AG, BNP Paribas SA and Deutsche Bank AG confronting weak results, senior departures and even merger talks.

Can’t  Compete

With US banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. becoming more dominant, firms like Nomura are getting increasingly marginalised. 

“On its own, Nomura lacks the resources to be more than a niche player,” Michael Makdad, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service, said in a report last week. 

The bank is also culling its corporate functions, reducing the number of departments from 10 to five. In a management shuffle announced last month, Nomura said Yuji Nakata would become chief risk officer, replacing O’Donald.

In Europe, the Tokyo-based bank has struggled to generate profits ever since it bought Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s operations there in 2008. The bank’s job cuts there will mostly target rates and credit traders in London, Bloomberg reported last week.

If successful, the restructuring “will help Nomura refocus its business, right size its infrastructure, and reduce earnings volatility,” according to an April 6 report by Moody’s Investors Service, which described the moves at “credit positive.”- Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/nearly-a-third-of-pakatan-govts-economic-promises-achieved-says-ideas/,"Nearly a third of Pakatan Govt's economic promises achieved, says Ideas",Economy,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",12:59 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Pakatan Harapan Government, which swept into power in May last year, has fulfilled nearly a third of its economic promises but more needs to be done,  the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas) says.

In its first edition of Projek Pantau, a report card on PH’s performance in fulfilling promises in its Buku Harapan manifesto, issued on Tuesday it highlighted:

* The government moved quickly to implement its signature promises, including abolition of GST;

* The government has allocated significant resources to supporting Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and encouraging technological adoption;

* The government has significantly improved the transparency of the budget and the government’s overall financial position; and

* The government has laid out an ambitious plan to tackle corruption which includes important reforms of the public procurement system.

However, Faiz Zaidi, executive at the Democracy and Governance Unit, Ideas pointed out: “In many of these areas, the real test will be implementation but it is encouraging that the government is on track to deliver these important reforms. 

“The government should maintain momentum in these areas and should ensure these successes are communicated clearly to the public to build confidence in the government’s performance,” he said.

For this first edition, Ideas analysed 192 sub-promises, broken down from 23 main promises.  Ideas said it considered all promises in Pillar 1 (Reduce the People’s Burden) and Pillar 3 (Spur Sustainable and Equitable Economic Growth), alongside three promises in Pillar 2 (Institutional and Political Reforms).

“Our overall conclusion is that the government is performing reasonably well in delivering its manifesto promises. Nearly one year into their first term in office, over 29% cent of their economic promises are either achieved or on track,” it said. 

However, Ideas said other areas however, are in more trouble, in particular a number of highly ambitious targets that are proving difficult to reach:

* The government has implemented a range of measures to reduce the cost of living, most notably abolishing GST. So far - these measures have focused on short term measures, such as subsidies and price control, rather than structural reform to different product markets to lower prices more sustainably.

* The government has successfully restructured BR1M into Bantuan Sara Hidup, but it has not been put under the purview of a statutory body which could prevent political misuse.

* In housing, although the government is implementing a detailed strategy we judge that this will be insufficient to achieve the ambitious promise to build one million more affordable homes, given the continued focus on a government-led approach which has failed to deliver in the past.

* In healthcare, the government’s increase in the health budget is far below the level needed to reach 4% of GDP. Ultimately the discussion on providing sustainable healthcare need to be elevated.

* Ambitious reform of Government Linked Companies (GLCs), in particular delivering the promise that GLCs will not compete against private companies seems increasingly unlikely as the government has committed itself to no clear strategy.

* Although trade and investment continue to rise, the government has stalled on ratification of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the prospects for an EU Free Trade Agreement also look slim.

This links to a wider concern voiced by many that the government needs to frame a clear and compelling trade and industrial policy for Malaysia.

“In these areas, we recommend that the government recalibrate its approach to ensure that the ambitious targets of the manifesto can be achieved,” Faiz said.

The top three areas the government has said and done little or nothing to demonstrate that progress is being made:

* The government has allocated significant resources to upgrade infrastructure in Orang Asal communities, but has not set out a comprehensive approach to address the other issues facing these communities - including land rights and education.

* On tax, the government has so far only proposed modest reforms, although the government has formed a Tax Reform Committee it is not clear what direction reform is likely to take, or even what the scope of reform might be. The government  will have to balance the competing demands of raising additional revenue to fund public services and sticking to its promise of reducing the tax burden.

* Although the government has set allocated resources to support SMEs in the form of loans, it does not seem to be applying the same attention to reviewing and reducing the regulatory burden on business, and small business in particular.

In these areas, Ideas recommended the government move quickly to set out to reconfirm its political commitment to these promises and set out clear policy direction to achieve them. 

“We also urge the government to be more strategic and coordinated in communicating with the public. This is important not only to demonstrate what they have achieved, but a maturing democracy like Malaysia needs informed citizens who are able to raise the political debate to a higher level,” Faiz said."

China is the world’s largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even though such activities previously fell under a regulatory grey area.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.

The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to over 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.

It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has until May 7 to comment on the draft.

State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday that the draft list ”distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” towards the cryptocurrency industry.

Last week, the price of bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of the 2017 bubble, and breaking $5,000 for the first time since mid-November, though analysts and traders admitted that they were puzzled by the surge.

On Tuesday, bitcoin was trading at $5,190.

The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.

China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.

Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, and last year three filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, looking to raise billions of dollars.

However, the two largest, Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining gear, and Canaan Inc, have since let their applications lapse.

People familiar with the deals said that Hong Kong regulators had many questions about the companies’ business models and prospects.

According to Canaanâs IPO prospectus filed last year, sales of blockchain hardware primarily for crypto currency mining in China were worth 8.7 billion yuan ($1.30 billion) in 2017, 45 percent of global sales by value.

The prospectus forecasts that sales in China would rise to 35.6 billion yuan by 2020. - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/trump-eyes-tariffs-on-us$11b-of-eu-goods-for-airbus-subsidy/,Trump eyes tariffs on US$11b of EU goods for Airbus subsidy,Corporate News,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",2:42 PM MYT,"CHICAGO: President Donald Trump’s administration is proposing tariffs on some $11 billion in imports from the European Union in response to harm the U.S. says is being caused by the bloc’s subsidies to Boeing Co. rival Airbus SE.

In issuing the list, which includes passenger helicopters, various cheeses and wines, ski-suits and certain motorcycles, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office cited the World Trade Organization’s finding that the aid to Airbus has “repeatedly” caused “adverse effects to the United States,” the USTR said in a statement Monday evening.

The Trump administration said, starting Monday, it is beginning a process under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to “identify products of the EU to which additional duties may be applied until the EU removes those subsidies.”

The threatened tariffs would be implemented only after the WTO gave the final go-ahead this summer, the administration said -- a rare show of faith in an institution that Trump himself has assailed.

The move is provocative on a number of fronts, however. 

The U.S. said it would impose the tariffs under the same previously dormant trade statute that it has used to justify duties on China over the past year.

The threat also comes just as the EU’s members are in the final stages of negotiating the terms of a mandate for the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, to begin talks on industrial tariffs with the Trump administration. 

The latest threat may therefore further complicate those talks. Some EU members, led by France, are already skeptical of the value of negotiations with the U.S., which were agreed to last July in a bid by the EU to avoid auto tariffs Trump has threatened. 

Furthermore, a draft of the mandate seen by Bloomberg specifically gives the EU an opt-out if the U.S. were to impose tariffs on the bloc using the Section 301 justification.

Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, said in a statement on Monday night that the U.S. had lost patience with what is now one of the WTO’s longest running sagas.

“This case has been in litigation for 14 years, and the time has come for action,” he said in the statement. 

Yet he also signaled that the administration wanted to see an end to the EU subsidies in question, which Boeing Co. and the U.S. claim give Airbus an unfair advantage in the highly competitive passenger aircraft market internationally.

“Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft,” he said. “When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional U.S. duties imposed in response can be lifted.”

In a statement, Boeing said the company “supports the U.S. trade representative and his team in their ongoing efforts to level the playing field in the global aircraft marketplace.”

The proposed tariffs come nearly 15 years after the U.S. first complained to the WTO that Airbus had widely benefited from billions of dollars in illegal subsidies. 

A countersuit by the European Union is still winding its way through the trade court, which found last month that about $325 million in tax incentives offered by Washington state to Boeing were unlawful. - Bloomberg"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/wynn-considers-us$7b-crown-deal-in-search-of-asia-growth/,Wynn considers US$7b Crown deal in search of Asia growth,Corporate News,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",3:23 PM MYT,"SYDNEY: Wynn Resorts Ltd. is in talks to buy Australian billionaire James Packer’s Crown Resorts Ltd. for A$9.99 billion ($7.12 billion) as the Las Vegas casino empire looks for growth in Asia amid a slowdown in the gambling enclave of Macau.

The proposed deal, which values Crown at A$14.75 per share, 26 percent more than Monday’s closing price, will also allow Packer to divest his single largest asset, completing a remarkable corporate retreat for a titan who’s been beset by political trouble and mental health issues in recent years.

Crown shares soared Tuesday in Sydney trading after the company confirmed confidential discussions, climbing 19.7 percent to close at A$14.05.

Crown’s Australian rival Star Entertainment Group Ltd. jumped 5.4 percent, while shares of New Zealand casino Skycity Entertainment Group Ltd. rose 2 percent.

Wynn’s interest in Melbourne-based Crown, which is almost solely focused on its domestic market where big-spending VIP gamblers have become more elusive, seems unusual, but the Las Vegas-based empire is desperately seeking to shore up its presence among Asian bettors.

Unlike its competitors who already have footholds elsewhere in Asia -- from Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s Singapore resort to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd.’s City of Dreams in Manila -- Wynn is currently confined to Macau, where expansion is approaching its limit. 

And they’re all fiercely competing for an operating license in Japan, the region’s next gambling goldmine.

“Wynn’s pursuit of Crown represents the need for Macau operators to expand in other markets to support long-term profit growth,” said Bloomberg Intelligence Asia gaming analyst Margaret Huang. 

But the deal will siphon off cash that Wynn could have used on a Japanese resort, estimated to cost up to $10 billion, and Australia’s weakened gaming demand is concerning, she said.

Union Gaming Group LLC analyst John DeCree said that the acquisition was likely a defensive move on Wynn’s part, in order that it not become a takeover target for rivals like Las Vegas Sands or MGM Resorts International. 

“Not only would a larger enterprise be a more difficult target, but it would deter potential suitors as U.S.-based peers have little to no strategic interest in Australia,” he wrote in a note Tuesday.

Crown said in a statement that discussions are at a preliminary stage and no agreement has been reached between the parties in relation to the structure, value or terms of a transaction. There’s no certainty that the discussions will result in a transaction, the company added. A Wynn spokesman declined to comment on the talks with Crown.

If the parties come to terms, Wynn would be buying a company whose ambitions are in active decline. Crown largely retreated from overseas markets after a crackdown in China in late 2016 that resulted in 19 current and former Crown staff being convicted of illegally promoting gambling on the mainland, receiving jail terms of as long as 10 months.

A Simpler Life

The company has since closed almost all its regional marketing offices in Asia, which funneled big-stakes players to Australia, and sold out of a Macau casino venture. 

The episode “shook me to the core,” Packer said in a rare interview with the Australian newspaper in October 2017. 

A few months later, he quit the board of Crown in March 2018 due to mental health issues and stepped down as a director of his private investment company.

In the 2017 interview, Packer also said he wanted a more “simple life” and acknowledged he’d lost friends, put on weight and had led a reclusive life at his polo estate in Argentina.

Crown is now focused on its existing casinos in Perth and Melbourne and is building a new six-star hotel, residential and gaming venue in Sydney, which is due to be completed in 2021.

Under its current structure, the transaction would make Packer a significant shareholder in Wynn. Packer’s private investment company, Consolidated Press Holdings, owns about 46 percent of Crown, so any deal hinges on Packer’s approval.

Wynn Resorts has had its share of high-profile trouble. In February 2018, founder and former chief executive officer Steve Wynn stepped down following reports that he sexually harassed a number of employees over his career. 

He has denied that any of his sexual relationships were non-consensual. He later sold all his holdings in the company. - Bloomberg"

The agency will include the request in its long-awaited white paper when it is tabled in parliament on Wednesday, said the person, who asked not to be named as the bill hasn’t been publicly presented. If approved, the funds would likely be disbursed in stages, the person said.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s administration has had to step in to rescue struggling state institutions as its fight against corruption exposes pockets of financial trouble. 

In December, the government approved a 19.9 billion ringgit aid for the Lembaga Tabung Haji.

Extending financial aid to Felda may further weigh on Mahathir’s efforts to narrow the budget deficit, which reached a five-year high in 2018.

A representative from Felda declined to comment on the rescue, while confirming that the white paper will be tabled on Wednesday. 

Representatives from the finance and economy ministries didn’t immediately comment.

Critical Level

The Federal Land Development Authority, as its full name goes, plans to sell off some assets to help fix its finances as it grapples with an ongoing corruption investigation. 

Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Ali said in October that Felda is looking to cut its debt to 6.8 billion ringgit by end-2018. Its cash flow was at a “critical” level, with 8 billion ringgit in debt as of June 2018, he said then.

Felda’s former chairman Isa Samad was charged with bribery linked to a hotel purchase. The government commissioned the white paper in September for Felda to explain the reasons behind its poor financial performance.

Even its publicly-listed plantation arm has sought to distance itself from the agency, changing its name last July to FGV Holdings Bhd., from Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd ., to help recover shares that were weighed down by its parent’s financial scandals.- Bloomberg"

He said this younger generation of retail investors are demanding better service at lower cost.
 
""Apart from greater digitalisation, brokers will need to diversify their products to attract new sets of investors,"" he said.
 
""If you want to deal with the younger generation effectively, you have to deal with them online,” Lim said in his speech at the Bursa Excellence Awards 2018. Lim's speech was delivered by Treasury deputy secretary-general (investment) Datuk Asri Hamidon.
 
He said in this regard, the recently-revised Guidelines on Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) would allow a much wider range of products to be developed for people of varying risk appetites. 

""ETFs are an attractive asset class providing investors with affordable diversification options in the capital market. 

""It is a good entry product for new investors that is capable of not only encouraging greater public participation in the market, but also ensure that the wealth of the nation gets shared in a more equitable manner to a wider pool of people,"" he said.

Overall, most major construction stocks have been rising in recent months, as investors put their bets on the potential revival of mega-infrastructure projects that had been put on hold since Pakatan Harapan came into power mid-last year.
Earlier, it was the widely-reported potential revival of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) that had been driving the uptrend of the construction stocks.
While investors have turned positive on the construction sector on the possible revival of mega-infrastructure projects, some brokerages prefer to maintain a cautious view until official announcements of the status of the projects are made.
CIMB Research has maintained its “underweight” stance on the sector despite acknowledging news reports hinting on a scaled-down version of the ERCL getting the green light from the government by the end of the month.
“Bilateral renegotiations on the ECRL are pointing to a revival of the project with significant cost reductions, which is positive for local contractors if a sizeable portion of the project is subcontracted by China Communications Const-ruction Co Ltd (CCCC),” CIMB Research wrote in its report.
It noted that CCCC was likely to remain as the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contractor for the ECRL. 
“Pending an official announcement on the ECRL, details of the new project structure under the EPCC/turnkey model and the official proportion of subcontract works to local players, we maintain our ‘underweight’ rating on the sector,” CIMB Research explained. 
Citing recent media reports that both Malaysia and China had agreed to revive the ECRL project, albeit on a smaller scale, with significant cost reduction and a rerouting of the alignment, TA Research said it was a positive development on the sector.
“We are positive on the development, as the revival of the mega-project is likely to boost job opportunities and confidence in the construction sector, which has been in the doldrums since the change of the federal government in the 14th General Election,” TA Research wrote in its recent report.
According to the brokerage, key beneficiaries of the revival of the ECRL could include IJM Corp Bhd , HSS Engineering Bhd, Econpile Holdings Bhd , Advancecon Holdings Bhd and Gabungan AQRS Bhd .
Other contractors that could also benefit are Gamuda, Sunway Construction Group Bhd , WCT Holdings Bhd  and Gadang Holdings Bhd .
Nevertheless, TA Research has maintained its “underweight” recommendation on the construction sector. This is because it has deemed the sector’s valuations as having run ahead of its fundamentals, especially after the recent rebound in the share prices of some construction stocks. 
“In addition, the property market, in which most of the contractors have direct and/or indirect exposure to, remains challenging,” it said.
“With prices of key construction materials such as cement and steel bars at depressed levels, in the event that the prices of these materials rebound, this could pose a risk of margin contraction to existing jobs in the pipeline, which the companies have tendered and secured based on a lower cost budgeted for the construction materials,” it added.
Overall, the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index (KLCON Index) rose 0.83%, or 1.71 points, to 207.6 points yesterday. Year-to-date, the KLCON Index has gained 33%."

The letter was sent to the EU over the weekend, said Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating minister for maritime affairs, who also oversees natural resources issues. He declined on Monday to disclose the content of the letter.

Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's top producers of the vegetable oil, have both threatened a World Trade Organization challenge against the EU over its plan to phase out the use of palm oil by 2030 in renewable transport fuel.

Delegations from both countries arrived in Brussels for an official visit on Monday and Tuesday.

Indonesia's coordinating minister for economic affairs Darmin Nasution said the country would definitely file a WTO complaint once the new rules were adopted. Tan Yew Chong, secretary general for Malaysia's ministry of primary industries, said his country would do the same.

The joint mission of the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries, which also includes Colombia, have a series of meetings with EU officials, lawmakers and national governments to convey their disappointment and to fight the act put forward by the European Commission.

It will become law unless a majority in the European Parliament or in the group of EU countries objects. So far, there are no indications that either will do so.

The EU plans to increase its use of renewable energy sources and to take into account deforestation when it determines what products can be labelled renewable.

Last month, the European Commission determined that palm oil has resulted in excessive deforestation and that it should no longer be considered a renewable transport fuel, albeit with some exemptions.

Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer, argues that rather than promoting sustainability in the vegetable oil sector, the regulation is more about protecting and promoting the European Union's home-grown vegetable oils, such as rapeseed and sunflower.

Nasution said the EU was ignoring vastly higher yields of oil from palm and said 64 percent of his country was still covered in forest.

Indonesia would, he added, review its relationship with the EU. The two are currently in talks on forming a free trade agreement.

European spirits makers said last week they are facing difficulties exporting drinks to Indonesia as tensions over palm rise, but an Indonesian official denied that it was a retaliation against EU's renewable energy policy. - Reuters"

However, the new allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes.“I can’t comprehend how this could have happened, despite having auditors,” said Setsuko Shibata, a retired homemaker who said her family had held Nissan shares for decades. “I can’t say I feel better about the situation after today’s explanation.”Meeting shareholders for the first time since Ghosn’s arrest rocked the global auto industry last year, chief executive Hiroto Saikawa started proceedings at a Tokyo hotel by apologising for the inconvenience the scandal had caused, followed by a deep bow of contrition from him and a panel of executives and directors.Proceedings were at times interrupted by some hecklers on the floor of the meeting, which was attended by a near record-high 4,100 shareholders.The shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and co-accused Greg Kelly from Nissan’s board of directors. Kelly has also denied all charges against him.They also voted in Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard as a director, an expected move that was widely seen as assuaging concern about the future of the Nissan-Renault automaking alliance engineered by Ghosn.The fall of one of the world’s most-feted executives appeared to have left some Nissan shareholders nonplussed.“The situation seems to go deeper than it looks based on the information,” said shareholder 68-year-old Roberto Montoya. “I’m very suspicious of the situation, and most people are.”Ghosn’s lawyers have called the latest arrest an attempt to muzzle him. He was due to speak at a news conference this week, but instead a video statement from him will be shown today at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan, the FCCJ said on its website.Saikawa yesterday said Nissan may claim damages against Ghosn, and that he would work to stabilise the company before standing down as chief executive.“This is not an issue we can fix overnight,” Saikawa told shareholders. “We need to fulfil the task (of improving governance) and prepare the company for our next steps, and then pass the leadership baton.”Saikawa also told shareholders he did not want to pay severance to Ghosn.Renault’s Senard at the meeting stressed the importance of the automaking alliance.“I will constantly suggest the best possible evolutions in the framework of the alliance,” he said. “We want to secure the right future for Nissan.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/construction-counters-on-a-roll/,Construction counters on a roll,Construction,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Construction stocks, led by IJM Corp Bhd  and Gamuda Bhd , rallied yesterday on high hopes that several large infrastructure development projects, currently put on hold, would be revived soon.
Rakuten Trade Research said sentiment on the sector has turned positive,  driven by news flows concerning the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and upcoming projects in Penang.
“Sentiment is becoming more upbeat on the ECRL, which is tagged at a massive RM35bil to RM40bil, as the project is touted to be confirmed anytime soon. 
“Meanwhile, the Penang light rail transit and the Pan Island Link 1 will certainly shed light on the current government’s willingness to roll out projects to boost the nation’s economic activities. 
“This also reinforces our strong stance on the construction sector, which should be the star performer this year,” it said in a report yesterday.
It is worth noting that many construction stocks have rallied since the beginning of the year, as investors have positioned themselves on the roll out of mega-infrastructure projects.
IJM Corp rose 5.5% to RM2.30, while Gamuda increased 4.8% to RM3.25 a share. On a year-to-date basis, both stocks have risen more than 41%, as talk of the ECRL project’s revival has been ongoing for the past couple of months.
Building material counter Ann Joo Resources Bhd , meanwhile, closed 8% higher to RM1.76 while Lafarge Malaysia Bhd  fell 4.6% to RM2.49 yesterday.
Lafarge had earlier won contracts under the ECRL project before it was suspended. The ECRL project earlier had carried a price tag of RM55bil as announced in 2016 before ballooning to RM81bil as disclosed after the new government stepped in last year.
The FBM KLCI closed higher yesterday aided by telco and plantation counters. The index ended 2.54 points or 0.15% higher to 1,644.35, with 500 gainers, 386 losers and 383 counters remaining unchanged.
Regional markets were mixed, with the Shanghai Composite Index shedding 0.05%, CSI 300 losing 0.12%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 ending 0.21% lower and Singapore’s STI slipping 0.22%.
Hong Kong shares rose 0.47% and South Korea’s KOSPI ended the day flat.
On the ECRL, the construction of the 688-km long rail link was suspended last July after the new government found irregularities in the terms of the “lopsided” contract would cost between RM34.4bil and RM41.3bil.
The continuation of the project is expected to be ironed out by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is scheduled to visit China from April 24 to 28 at the invitation of Chinese premier Xi Jinping to attend the second Belt and Road Initiative summit.
The rail link, if built, will connect Port Klang in Selangor with Pengkalan Kubor in Kelantan, and will be constructed in two phases.
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng had earlier hinted that the ECRL project may be rerouted to Negri Sembilan. He had said that the project would be continued if negotiations on the project led by the chairman of the Council of Eminent Persons, Tun Daim Zainuddin, could reduce the cost of its construction further.
It has been said that the smaller-scale ECRL project would also see commitment by the Chinese government to buy Malaysian palm oil and bring in projects.
The ECRL project started off with an initial estimate of less than RM30bil in 2007. When the previous government signed the agreement with the main contractor, China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC), in 2016, it was for only Phase 1 – from Gombak to Wakaf Baru in Kelantan – tagged at RM46bil. The cost of Phase 2, from Gombak to Port Klang, was another RM9bil.
On May 13, 2017, the previous government signed an additional agreement with CCCC to carry out Phase 2 of the project.
According to these figures, the basic cost of the project amounted to about RM66.78bil. However, it did not include the land acquisition cost, interest, fees and operating costs – which brought the final amount of the ECRL to a staggering RM81bil."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/brexit-hangs-in-the-balance-as-mays-government-talks-with-labour/,Brexit hangs in the balance as May's government talks with Labour,Corporate News,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",7:06 AM MYT,"LONDON: Brexit hung in the balance on Monday as Prime Minister Theresa May tried to coax the Labour Party into agreeing a divorce deal with a better chance of passage by parliament, ahead of a crisis EU summit where she will try to delay the April 12 departure.

Britain's exit from the EU has already been delayed once but May is asking the bloc for yet more time as she courts veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party wants to keep Britain more closely tied to the bloc after Brexit.

May heads to Berlin and Paris on Tuesday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron and will be phoning other leaders before setting out the case for another delay at Wednesday's emergency EU summit in Brussels.

Nearly three years after the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU, May warned that Brexit might never happen, but said that she would do everything possible to make sure it did.

""We have been in touch with the opposition today and technical talks between officials will take place this evening,"" a spokesman for May said.

Labour's Brexit point man, Keir Starmer, said earlier that May's government had so far not shifted from its red lines on Brexit and so no way forward had been agreed.

""Both us and the government have approached this in the spirit of trying to find a way forward. We haven't found that yet. We will continue to do that,"" Starmer said.

May's spokeswoman said she wanted Britain to have an independent trading policy - something hard to reconcile with Labour's demand to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU - and that both sides would need to compromise.

The deputy political editor of the Telegraph newspaper, Steven Swinford, said Labour and the Conservative government were still discussing both a customs union and the idea of holding a confirmatory referendum on any deal they agree.

Both ideas are anathema to many in May's party, whose rebels have helped trigger three parliamentary defeats of the withdrawal deal she negotiated with the EU last year.

""We all hope that these talks will produce a positive outcome. I've said many times before, we can be more, much more ambitious in our future relationship with the UK,"" EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told a news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin.

BREXIT DELAY?

The 2016 referendum revealed a United Kingdom divided over much more than EU membership, and has sparked impassioned debate about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and what it means to be British.

Yet, more than a week after Britain was originally supposed to have left the EU, nothing is resolved as May, the weakest leader in a generation, battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a profoundly divided parliament.

EU leaders, fatigued by the serpentine Brexit crisis, must decide on Wednesday whether to grant May, who has asked for a postponement until June 30, a further delay. The decision can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states.

Without an extension, Britain is due to leave the EU at 2200 GMT on Friday, without a deal to cushion the economic shock.

While the EU is not expected to trigger such a potentially disorderly no-deal exit, diplomats said all options were on the table - from refusing a delay to granting May's request or pushing for a longer postponement.

But May is boxed in at home.

Brexiteers in her cabinet insisted on at most a short delay, while Mark Francois, deputy chief of the Conservatives' hardline eurosceptic faction in parliament, demanded she resign and called on the party to vote on forcing her out - even though there is no formal provision to do so before December.

As the crisis grinds on, one survey suggested that voters wanted a strong leader willing to force through reform of a political system that has been found badly wanting by Brexit.

Research by the Hansard Society found that 54 percent of voters wanted a strong leader willing to break the rules, while 72 percent said the political system needed ""quite a lot"" or ""a great deal"" of improvement.  Reuters"

British, Swiss and U.S. shares would remain on its existing platform in London, the LSE said in a statement. Turquoise was committed to offering the full range of shares on its UK platform, the LSE said in a statement on Monday.

In the event of a hard Brexit on April 12, Turquoise intends to reintroduce European Economic Area shares on its London platform over the course of the year, it added.

The LSE's preparations are similar to those announced by Europe's biggest pan-European share trading platform, Cboe, on Friday.

Britain's exit from the EU was still hanging in the balance on Monday as Prime Minister Theresa May tried to coax the Labour Party into agreeing a divorce deal, two days before an emergency summit.

The sector is waiting to see if Britain's markets watchdog will impose restrictions on where shares can be traded if there is a no-deal Brexit.

In March alone, U.K.-based companies squirreled away raw materials and components at the fastest pace of any industrialized nation, according to a closely watched survey of manufacturers published by IHS Markit since 1992.“This dillydallying—it’s a total frustration,” said Richard Grant-Pearce, managing director of Stockton Engineering Ltd., based in Birmingham, a maker of brackets, wires and other metal parts used by manufacturers in a range of industries.Stocks of finished goods in Britain also rose at the fastest pace on record last month, as factories churned out extra products to meet a surge in demand from customers worried about possible Brexit disruption. U.K. manufacturers are particularly vulnerable because they import so many components from Europe to go into their exports, and so would be hit twice by any new tariffs, border delays and paperwork.Prime Minister Theresa May has failed three times to win parliamentary backing for a deal she hammered out with Brussels on the terms of Britain’s long-planned exit from the European Union.

In its research note issued on Tuesday, it expects MAHB’s efforts in not only attracting more new airlines but also offering increased connectivity to moderate the effects of the departure levy set to be imposed in June 2019 for outgoing international passengers. 

“As such, we reiterate our optimism that MAHB passenger numbers will surpass the 100m mark in 2019, while maintaining a relatively conservative growth rate of 3.5%. 

“All things considered, we maintain our BUY call on MAHB with a TP of RM9.44 per share as it is a proxy to Malaysia’s inbound/outbound travel industry, being Malaysia’s largest airport operator. 

“We opine that its undemanding valuations of a trailing PE ratio of 18.3 times, compared to the average of its regional peers with a PE ratio of nearly 50x presents a good opportunity for investors to accumulate the stock,” it said.

To recap, Malaysia and Singapore ended its aerospace disputes following the withdrawal of Singapore’s Instrument Landing System (ILS) procedures for its Seletar Airport. Meanwhile, Malaysia will indefinitely suspend its permanent Restricted Area (RA) over Pasir Gudang. 

As such, Firefly will resume its flights from Subang Airport to Seletar Airport beginning late April 2019. 

Firefly’s flights to Singapore were suspended on Dec 1, 2018 as they were remaining matters in relation to Singapore’s plans to move turboprop aircraft operations from Changi Airport to Seletar Airport. 

The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore (KUL-SIN) route is the top Asia Pacific international route with more than 30,000 flights from March 2018 to February 2019 according to Official Aviation Guide (OAG). 

Based on MAHB’s guidance, Firefly operates around 4,000 flights on an annualized basis (assuming five to six return flights per day at minimum to and from Singapore).
As such, Firefly would be ranked higher than Jetstar Asia in terms of number of flights to and from Singapore but capacity would be much lower as Firefly’s turboprop aircraft can only carry 72 passengers."

""We also revised higher our FY20 associate profit assumption to RM18.7m (CSE Global: RM12m, Kota Marudu: RM3m, Tanzania: RM2m and remaining from KAJV) and that for FY21 to RM22m from our earlier <RM10m forecasts,"" it said. 

The stock remains Affin Hwang's top pick with an unchanged target price of RM4.50.

In a note, the research house said the reallocation to the Bintulu Integrated Energy Hub (BIEH) next year would be a strong re-rating catalyst as this would allow the group to bid for more contracts.

THe BIEH will comprise of an MRO facility, steel fabrication yards and warehouse and storiage yeards as well as blasting workshops and nine factories.

""By our estimates, the massive 30-acre development will double Serba’s current maintenance floor space, and its fabrication capacity by slightly more than that,"" Affin Hwang said.

It added that the consolidation would help the group's operating efficiency and margins as well as enable the group to bid for more mainenance and construction jobs in East Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore.

The BIEH is targeted for physical completion by Dec 10, 2019 with the MRO service centre to be completed by June 2019.

Serba Dinamik recently rented a third Bintulu service centre to cater for the higher job flow, mainly to service the five-year maintenance, construction and mofification contract secured from Petronas Carigali in February 2019 as well as the Shell MGS contracts.

In its research note issued on Tuesday it said that in particular, all ethylene chain chemicals are exhibiting severe weakness due to abundance of US exports into the region. 

“We believe that petrochemical prices should trend higher going forward as consumers need to restock inventories and drive production. No change to our earnings forecast, Hold call and TP of RM9.05 based on 8.4 times FY19 EV/EBITDA which is a 10% premium to peers,” it said. 
  
Global petrochemical prices have been on a declining trend since late 4Q18. This was due to the decline in crude oil prices, US-China trade war spat, and uncertainties stemming from the Iranian sanctions and the impending Brexit — or not.
 
“We estimate Petronas Chemicals’s 1Q19 ASP to be at RM3,202 a tonne (-7.4% YoY, -13.6% QoQ),” it said. 

Maybank Research said there were two scheduled maintenance shutdown in the quarter and this will depress utilisation rate to high 80% levels (1Q18 was 100%). 

“Based on these assumptions, we estimate a core net profit of RM970mil (-9% YoY, -25% QoQ) in 1Q19.  

“We are of the view that the current weak petrochemical prices are due to geopolitical uncertainty. The underlying demand should still be healthy underpin by global GDP-growth (Maybank Research: +3.6% 2019E). 

“We gather from industry players that major consumers are buying on consignment and keeping inventories at a minimum,” it said.

Maybank Research said at some point in time, consumers need to re-stock and this could potentially happen in 2Q-3Q19. This should support for a higher and more stable petrochemical prices.
        
 The research house believes the market is aware Petronas Chemicals’s 1Q19 will be soft. 

But should there be a dip in its share price, it advocate accumulating for its longer term potential.
 
“Petronas Chemicals is fairly valued relative to its regional peers but its FY19E dividend yield of 3.3% is respectable,” it said."

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was basically flat after brushing its highest since late August last year during the previous session.

Australian shares dipped 0.25 percent while Japan's Nikkei was down 0.15 percent.

Wall Street shares delivered a mixed performance on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 0.3 percent while the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent. Concerns over slowing U.S. earnings have undermined U.S. equities in recent sessions, though a strong jobs report last week helped to soothe frayed nerves.

The S&P 500, however, moved on its own momentum for its eight straight session of gains and the longest winning streak since October 2017, as rallying crude prices lifted energy shares.

Oil prices rose to their highest since November, driven by fighting in Libya along with ongoing supply cuts pledged by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela. [O/R]

Broader market sentiment remained subdued as investors' focus was on potential flashpoints, including a crucial Brexit summit as well as a meeting on trade between the European Union and China set for later on Tuesday.

""The market is very much in a wait-and-watch mode,"" said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia in Sydney.

""It's looking for the next catalyst that's hopefully going to take stock markets higher, but it's also very wary that we've had such a great run in stocks and general growth that we might see a real sharp correction,"" he said.

Twidale added that any news on the trade front around the Sino-U.S. tariff negotiations and the upcoming summit between the EU and China ""could really start to add to some volatility"" to markets.

Investors will also focus on a European Central Bank meeting on Wednesday and the start in earnest of the U.S. first-quarter earnings period, with analysts now expecting it to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016.

U.S. March inflation figures and minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting are due to be released on Wednesday. Friday's U.S. jobs report showed strong employment creation but subdued wages growth, backing the Fed's recent dovish policy tilt.

In the currency market, the euro held steady at $1.1259 after rising nearly 0.4 percent overnight, its steepest one-day rise in nearly three-weeks.

Sterling was slightly higher at $1.3068, but not far from last month's low of $1.2945.

Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 111.35 yen, inching back toward its 1-1/2-month low of 109.70 touched on March 25.

In the commodity market, oil prices hovered near their highest since November 2018 on persistent worries about tightening supplies.

International benchmark Brent futures touched their strongest level since last November at $71.34 per barrel on Tuesday, and were still at $71.16 at 0057 GMT, up 6 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures also hit a November 2018 high, at $64.77 per barrel, before easing to $64.58, which was still 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, above their last settlement.

""Renewed fighting in Libya ... has seen Brent crude break above $70 per barrel,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

Libya is a significant supplier of oil to Europe, producing around 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in March.

A warplane attacked Tripoli's only functioning airport on Monday as eastern forces advancing on the Libyan capital disregarded international appeals for a truce in the latest of a cycle of warfare since Muammar Gaddafi's fall in 2011.

Hansen said the fighting in Libya added to an already tense market, which has been tightened this year by U.S. sanctions on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela as well as supply cuts led by the producer club of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

As a result, Brent and WTI crude oil futures have risen by 41 and 31 percent respectively since the start of the year. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/pdp-model-ideal-for-pan-borneo/,PDP model ideal for Pan Borneo,Corporate News,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",,"KUCHING: The project delivery partner (PDP) model chosen for the implementation of the Pan Borneo Highway project is ideal, as it ensures efficiency, accountability and transparency in the project’s contract administration.
According to Lebuhraya Borneo Utara (LBU) chief executive officer (CEO) Safuani Abdul Hamid, the PDP model has put in place contract administration policies, systems, formats and procedures that promote efficiency, accountability and transparency.  
“Coupled with a strong governance structure at various levels and solid support from the federal and state governments, the PDP model enables fast and decisive decision-making to meet project delivery targets.
“In the case of Pan Borneo Sarawak, there is great anticipation from the Sarawak public for us to deliver this safe and efficient highway in the shortest possible time.
“In line with public demand for the project to be carried out in a fair and transparent manner, the PDP model allows for this to happen for the good of the state and nation,” he added in a posting on LBU’s website.
LBU, the PDP for the RM16.49bil Pan Borneo Highway Sarawak project (phase 1), targets its full completion by 2021. The project’s overall work progress has currently reached about 38%.  
LBU said recently that it was optimistic that it could achieve some RM2bil in savings on this most ambitious infrastructure project in Sarawak as a result of its efficient design, as well as cost and change control management. 
Safuani said at the heart of the project execution was its pre- and post-contract administration in which LBU as PDP awards and manages contracts based on approved policies with the various works packages’ contractors.
“The Pan Borneo Highway Sarawak works packages are all remeasured in nature as opposed to being lump-sum contracts.
“The important difference with remeasured contracts is that payments are made for the actual value of work done based on quantities verified through a joint site measurement process conducted by multiple parties.
“In other words, contractors only get paid for actual work done on site. For the PDP, remeasured contracts are tied to meeting the ‘Target Cost Key Performance’ indicator that enables transparency and accountability to be better achieved.”
Safuani said the monthly progress payment claims’ evaluation process follows a stringent confirmation and verification methodology. It involves the consultants’ resident engineering teams on site, independent checking engineers, the PDP’s own construction management team, along with the government’s representatives, the Sarawak Public Works Department and the Sarawak Infrastructure Development and Transportation Ministry.
“Remeasured contracts are the preferred form of contract for a road project such as the Pan Borneo Highway, where there is a high degree of uncertainity for some works, particularly for ‘below-ground’ activities such as pile lengths, foundations, rock excavation, replacement of unsuitable materials as well as slope stabilisation.
“Remeasured contracts are seen as fair. The owner through the PDP assumes the risk for total quantities, while the works package contractor assumes the risk for fixed unit prices.”
Safuani clarified that the LBU did not pick the project contractors, as all major procurement decisions are made and finalised by the government.
Only through such approval does LBU award the works package contracts per the PDP agreement, he said."

These scheduled wastes, such as mineral sludges and sludges that contain one or several metals or fluoride, provide CMS with alternative sources of materials that serve as substitutes for the typical raw materials or fuels currently used in the group’s clinker, cement and concrete production activities. 
Last year, the group incorporated some 256 tonnes of calcium hydroxide sludge in the raw mix pile for the production of clinker, the key raw material for cement manufacturing.
“In 2019, we will close several deals with waste generators for scheduled waste codes SW427, SW207, SW204 and SW104 from several industrials in Sarawak.
“We are pressing for SW427 supplies from (industrial gas manufacturers) EOX Linde Kota Kinabalu, BIG (Industries Bhd) Miri and Bintulu and Piasau Gas Miri and Sibu Gas.
“The additional quantity per month will be around 200 to 300 tonnes,” according to CMS in its annual Sustainability Report 2018 released last week. (SW427 is defined as mineral sludges including calcium hydroxide sludges,phosphating sludges,calcium sulphite sludges and carbonates sludges.)
CMS, which is Sarawak’s sole cement manufacturer, said the group is continuing to look for additional sources of sludges from industries like those operating in Samalaju Industrial Park (SIP) (for energy intensive industries), Bintulu and Samajaya Free Industrial Zone  (for high-tech industries) here. 
“Following extensive research into using phosphogypsum as a replacement for limestone, our clinker plant has come to the conclusion that the waste material is viable as a material replacement.
“We have plans to purchase the waste material from an identified source.
“The plant has also considered replacing its light fuel oil with residual fuel oil.We are currently in discussions with Petronas and have sourced several recycled oil suppliers in the Kuching area. 
“The plant is also looking to substitute its use of limestone by up to 3% by replacing this with sludge,old kiln bricks and ash,” added the Sarawak conglomerate.  
In Samalaju Industrial Park, CMS is in talks with OM (Materials) Sarawak Sdn Bhd and Pertama Ferroalloys Sdn Bhd ( both own ferrosilicon and manganese smelting plants) and OCI Malaysia Sdn Bhd for the supply of scheduled wastes. 
“During the year,R&D (research and development) activities were conducted on waste generated within SIP in the laboratory and then on an industrial scale.
“Subsequently,the applications were submitted to and approved by the DOE (Department of Environment) in Putrajaya.”
CMS said it is currently negotiating with DOE on scheduled wastes’ transportation licences, especially on the sea route .
The company expects alternative raw materials’ usage to increase significantly once approval is granted by DOE to use scheduled wastes from waste generators at SIP and Samajaya Free Industrial Zone.  
CMS recently launched a new eco-friendly cement product - portland limestone cement (PLC) - which is manufactured by grinding a special blend of clinker, gypsum and high quality limestone .
“As limestone material is ready available and cheaper in price,the production of PLC with more than 20% limestone addition is reducing overall operational costs,thereby increasing profit margins.
“Unlike our flagship product - portland cement 42.5N - which is an all purpose product that can be used for all types of structures, PLC with a strength class of 32.5N is targetted for low-rise concrete structures, such as single storey residential,office and commercial buildings.
“Its high workability and plasticity makes PLC ideal for plastering and bricklaying and it is less susceptible to cracks during the drying process.”
“It can also be used for construction of drains and rural or village roads,” said CMS."

By UOB Kay Hian
Rating: Hold (maintained)
Target price: RM0.50
THE electronics manufacturing services company  has benefitted from the ongoing trade tensions between United States and China to secure new box-build contracts which the management believes could rake in about RM1.5bil in FY20.
UOB Kay Hian believes the new contracts could command a higher gross profit margin of around 6%, due to higher value-added processes. The group’s margin in financial year 2018 (FY18) was 5.1%.
Channel checks by the research house revealed that the new contracts are rendered by Chinese companies with end-customers based in the United States, and management only expects to see full contribution from the contracts in FY20.
EG also intends to spend around RM30mil, funded internally, in capital expenditure in FY19 and FY20 to purchase equipment and machineries for its newly-acquired production facilities in Sungai Petani to further support its vertical integration plan and new job wins. This would increase EG’s additional output by about 10 million units per annum or an additional 100% from its current capacity.
It also noted that some of EG’s existing box-build consumer electronics products have reached their end-of-life with an outstanding contract orderbook at RM200mil as of 1HFY19.
UOB Kay Hian maintains its hold call and the target price of RM0.50 on the back of better visibility on EG’s box-build venture following the contract wins and investment into the second plant.
It also cuts EG’s net profit forecasts by 11%, 4% and 16% respectively following the revision of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and box-build assumptions and the higher labour cost due to the minimum wage hike. 
A temporary blip is also expected in the PCBA division as a major customer of EG planned to relocate its plant to Thailand. Contributions are expected to normalise in FY20 as the plant is expected to be next to EG’s Thailand factory.
BERJAYA SPORTS TOTO BHD 
By Kenanga Research
Rating: Outperform (maintained)
Target price: RM2.95
BERJAYA Sports Toto (BToto) is seen as the most attractive sin stocks with its remarkable year-to-date (YTD) gain of 25%, mainly due to improving ticket sales.
This is a turn of fortune after having been suppressed in the past five years due to declining ticket sales.
Kenanga Research said that even with strong gains, BToto is still a laggard as it is the cheapest among sin stocks with its highest dividend yield. 
It is offering more than 6% yield against the rest at more than 3% and as such, BToto can be a sector catch-up play.
The research house noted that enforcement efforts to combat illegal operators were healthy for number forecast operators (NFO) as the size for the black market is easily one to times bigger than licensed NFO volumes.
BToto saw a fairly encouraging rise in ticket sales by 5%.
Kenanga Research maintains its outperform call on BToto with an upgraded target price of RM2.95. It also raised its terminal growth from 1% to 2%, similar to Magnum Bhd .Meanwhile, non-Sport Toto contributions, which amount to around less than 20% of the group’s pre-tax profit, are still small and volatile. Philippine-based Prime Gaming Management Corporation continues to receive lower rental income until a new contract is sorted out while earnings from UK-based super sport cars dealer HR Owen were fairly volatile given the auto sales value and the volatility of pound sterling risk.
The group’s 10.2% owned Vietnamese NFO firm Berjaya GTI is still in the red and is unlikely to be profitable in the near future given the infant NFO market there.

By Maybank IB Research
Rating: Sell (maintained)
Target price: RM0.08
THE largest offshore support vessel (OSV) provider in the country by fleet size is expected to remain in the red this year, on an average OSV utilisation rate of 60%.
Maybank IB Research has reiterated its sell call with a target price of RM0.08. Its earnings estimate for the company remain unchanged even though the domestic OSV market has improved on the back of Petronas’ Activity Outlook report.
Icon Offshore’s daily charter rate is at its historical trough and there is need to rise to reflect a cyclical recovery and to warrant a re-rating.
It needs to achieve a 62% utilisation rate just to be P&L break-even.
The research house said improvement in Icon Offshore’s OSV utilisation this year is a given, its main priority is to resolve its financial predicament.
Its net gearing level stood at 727% as at December 2018.
The proposed restructuring scheme is expected to be announced in 3Q19. 
Maybank IB Research said the need to restructure takes precedence over any prospect of an earnings turnaround or fleet rejuvenation exercise.
AIRASIA  GROUP BHD
By CGS CIMB
Rating: Reduce (maintained)
Target price: RM1.50
HIGHER jet fuel prices which have traded up to US$80/bbl and the capitalisation of operating leases on aircraft are expected to squeeze AirAsia Group Bhd’s profitability.
The spot oil prices have exceeded CGS CIMB’s assumptions of US$75/bbl for FY19F. 
The implementation of low-sulphur limits for marine fuels under the International Maritime Organisation 2020 rules may also cause a rise in jet fuel crack spreads, impacting airlines.
AirAsia is partially shielded by hedges covering 52% of its oil needs in FY19F with an effective exercise price of US$78/bbl of jet fuel and 40% of its oil needs in FY20F at US$60/bbl Brent.CGS CIMB said it also expects the airline to sell a further 25 planes to lessor Castlelake by 3Q19F after having sold 79 planes to lessor BBAM Ltd Partnership last year.
Together with other existing operating lease aircraft, AirAsia is expected to capitalise on RM11.8bil worth of borrowings related to the operating leases in FY19F, effectively bringing back to the balance sheet what had previously been off-balance sheet. 
According to the research house, the impact would be to raise reported gross gearing of FY19% in FY18 to 198% on a proforma basis after MFRS 16.
It added that the overall impact to P&L earnings from the sale and leasebacks (SLB) is negative because AirAsia would have to pay for the lessors’ profit margin and provide for a higher level of maintenance charges based on lessors’ conditions for lease returns.
CGS CIMB’s original assumption had been for AirAsia to own half and the other half via SLB for FY19F to FY21F.
Since AirAsia will be growing its group fleet entirely through SLB, the research house lowered its FY20-21F core EPS estimates to RM0.14 and RM0.12 respectively and forecast higher gearing levels at 161% and 212%.
The squeeze in profitability will see experience greater operating leverage from unexpected changes in fuel prices, exchange rates, competitive dynamics and airport taxes and levies."

This entailed the issuance of 149.09 million new shares at 21 sen a share to settle the RM31.13mil owed by Seacera Group and its subsidiaries – Seacera Ceramics Sdn Bhd and Seacera Properties Sdn Bhd – to creditors.
It is also planning a private placement of up to 126.34 million shares or 30% of its existing issued share capital to third-party investors to be identified at a later date.
A total of RM24.64mil in gross proceeds is expected to be raised, based on the share price of RM0.21. 
Around 81% or RM20mil will be utilised for the repayment of bank borrowings.
Seacera said in a statement that the board is taking a pre-emptive step to settle the amount owing to its settlement creditors via the issuance of settlement shares instead of depending on operation cash flow.
It added that this enabled the group to pay its creditors while preserving cash to focus on enhancing its existing business operations to overcome the difficult and challenging business environment currently.The proposed capitalisation will improve the group’s financial position and place it on a stronger financial footing and working capital position.
The company may face legal action from the creditors if shareholders do not give the green light, as the debts owed to creditors are due immediately.
Group managing director Zulkarnin Ariffin said the issuance of settlement shares was the better option in view of the weakening demand and stiff competition in the tiles industry arising from the slowdown in the property market and the decline in the construction sector.“The reduction in the bank borrowings of the group via the proposed private placement is expected to result in an estimated savings in interest payments of approximately RM1.24mil per annum,” he said in the statement.

“We expect to raise US$6.5bil of total capital this year,” Anthony Tan said yesterday in an interview, in which he laid out Grab’s strategy to become an app-for-everything in South-East Asia – home to about 650 million people.
Grab later said in a statement that it expects to invest a significant portion of the funds in Indonesia. Reuters first reported the funding target earlier on Monday.
“We basically received a very strong vote of confidence. And Masa shared that SoftBank is very happy with Grab and that SoftBank will provide unlimited support to power our growth,” said Tan, referring to SoftBank Group Corp founder and CEO Masayoshi Son.
SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The funding will be raised from strategic investors and be a mix of debt and equity, said Tan.
Grab’s massive financing round started shortly after the firm bought the South-East Asian operations of US peer Uber Technologies Inc in March last year.
Singapore-headquartered Grab is expanding aggressively in Indonesia, home of rival Go-Jek. Both are raising billions of dollars to bring ride-hailing, food delivery, e-commerce and banking to a populous region with a growing number of consumers that use smartphones to commute, shop and make payments.
Both Grab and Go-Jek started out in ride-hailing and have since amassed millions of users with cut-rate prices. Go-Jek’s backers include Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alphabet Inc’s Google.
Last month, Grab’s president Ming Maa – a former SoftBank executive – said Grab was considering raising more funds in the ongoing financing round, in which the SoftBank Vision Fund invested US$1.5bil.
On Monday, Tan said, “We have done a lot with SoftBank’s portfolio companies, both technical and operational expertise, and of course capital support as well.”
“That will help us grow very aggressively this year across our verticals – transport, mobility, food and payments,” he said, referring to SoftBank’s support.
Tan said Grab is looking to make at least six investments or acquisitions this year.
“With the amount of funding we have raised, and the support from strategic investors like SoftBank, we are so well-funded to execute on our expansion and investment plans, so there is really no need to IPO,” said Tan, who co-founded Grab with Harvard classmate Tan Hooi Ling.
Grab’s other backers include Toyota Motor Corp, Microsoft Corp and Hyundai Motor Co.
People with direct knowledge of the matter said Grab has raised about US$8bil since its launch almost 7 years ago. — Reuters

Lynas, the world’s only major producer of rare earths outside China, has been locked in a dispute with Malaysia, which has told it to remove years of accumulated waste at its Malaysian processing plant in order to have its licence renewed.
Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday that companies interested in acquiring Lynas had pledged to decontaminate low-level radioactivity from mined ore before shipping it to the country.Dr Mahathir did not identify any company. Lynas last month rejected a US$1.1bil takeover approach by Australian retail-to-chemicals conglomerate Wesfarmers.
Lynas chief executive Amanda Lacaze said yesterday that Lynas had been considering building new processing facilities for months in addition to its Malaysian operations as part of expansion plans and as a way to mitigate risk from any regulatory changes in Malaysia.
Initial ore processing to reduce levels of radioactivity would mean building a cracking and leaching plant at a cost of about A$100mil over three years, according to a research report by brokerage CLSA. Lynas was considering five locations, Lacaze said, but gave no details on cost or timing.
“We have been giving great consideration to... our future industrial footprint,” she told an analyst and investor call.
“We remain confident that we can agree a path forward with the Malaysian government which is good for Malaysia and good for our business.” 
Lynas mines rare earths at Mount Weld in Western Australia and currently ships the concentrated material to a US$800mil processing plant in Kuantan where it stores thousands of tonnes of waste.
Dr Mahathir said even Lynas could operate in the country as long as raw materials coming to Malaysia were cleaned.
His comments come after Malaysia’s Atomic Energy Licensing Board told Lynas in December that it must export stockpiles of a type of residue from its processing plant by Sept 2, when its full operating stage licence is due for renewal.
In February, Lynas said that exporting the residue within the mandated timeline was ”unachievable”.
Lynas shareholders played down the likelihood of Lynas being forced to close its plant in Malaysia.
“The prime minister has said he wants the plant to keep operating and stay open in Malaysia. My expectation then would be that the plant’s licence must be maintained,” said Matthew Ryland of Greencape Capital, the company’s second-biggest shareholder.
Lynas said it was seeking clarification from the Malaysian government on its latest comments, but had not yet heard back.
Wesfarmers said it welcomed the Malaysian comments which were consistent with talks it had had with senior government officials.
“We look forward to more detail from the government about Lynas’ operating licence certainty, to assess the conditionality of our proposal,” it said in a statement. — Reuters"

The quicker loan growth will also help mitigate possible margin erosion arising from a potential interest rate cut by the central bank.
Group chief executive officer Datuk Sulaiman Mohd Tahir said the AmBank Group is targeting to disburse RM6.8bil worth of loans to 2,350 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) this year.
The bank disbursed RM6.1bil worth of loans to 2,200 SMEs in 2018. 
“AmBank Group will continue to support SMEs through the much-needed financing. At the same time, we are also conscious of the need to go beyond providing companies with funding,” he said.
“Through our various SME-centric initiatives, we are focused on being there for our SME clientele, from cradle to initial public offering,” he told a media briefing on the bank’s latest initiatives for SMEs.
Among the initiatives Ambank is working on is to be able to expedite funding to SMEs within 24 hours from about one week, currently. 
“We have invested RM23mil in this system,” Sulaiman said the AmBank BizRACE evenet.The AmBank BizRACE event is an entrepreneurship challenge competition aimed at providing SMEs with access to valuable knowledge-sharing sessions and development training.
The bank’s renewed focus on small businesses came on the back of a more subdued economic outlook for this year.
Bank Negara, last month, said it will keep monetary policy accommodative after it lowered its gross domestic product growth forecast for 2019.
Several economists and analysts have predicted that the benchmark OPR would be slashed by 25 bps on the back of slower economic growth.
“The whole idea of reducing the OPR is to encourage investments because it’s cheaper to get financing, which would lead to high productivity,” Sulaiman said.
However, said he did not want to speculate on whether the central bank would cut the OPR.
He noted that a lower OPR would be great for consumers, it would have an impact on the margins of banks.
“A 25-bps change in the OPR would give a reduction in the margins of RM50mil. We make profits of between RM1.3bil and RM1.5bil,” he said.
Sulaiman said AmBank would be able to mitigate the impact should the OPR be slashed.
“It would be RM50mil for every RM1.5bil. However, if it can be offset against new loan growth as a result, hopefully, the profitability would still be there and only the margin would be compressed. 
Bank Negara governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said recently that the central bank would be on a “data-dependent” mode in deciding the direction of the OPR.
She also stressed that any adjustment in the OPR did not immediately suggest that there were risks to growth.
For the nine months ended Dec 31, 2018, AmBank’s net profit rose 19% to RM1.045bil from RM878.72mil in the previous corresponding period, while revenue increased 6.6% to RM6.78bil from RM6.36bil."

Jet’s lenders last month agreed to bail out the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a temporary majority stake in the company - while they look for a new investor - and providing a fresh loan of US$218mil.
In a notice on its website, SBI Capital Markets, a unit of SBI, said that prospective bidders are required to submit expressions of interest for up to 75% stake in debt-laden Jet by 6 pm local time (1230 GMT) on April 10.
Individuals, including foreign nationals, as well as a consortium of up to three companies are allowed to bid for a stake in the airline subject to Indian laws, the notice said. 
Foreign ownership of Indian airlines is capped at 49%.
KKR, Blackstone, TPG Capital among others are said to be in talks with consultancy firms to conduct due diligence in Jet, according to Bloomberg Quint.
Jet’s lenders, under the proposed bailout terms, would hold just over 50% of the airline, its founder and former chairman Naresh Goyal would hold 25.5% and Jet’s second-largest shareholder Etihad Airways’ stake would be 12%.
It was not immediately clear if Goyal and Etihad would also sell their stake as part of the auction.
Jet, saddled with more than US$1.2bil of debt, owes money to banks, lessors, suppliers and pilots. 
It has been forced to ground more than three-quarters of its fleet of 119 planes, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. — Reuters
India is keen to save Jet to prevent thousands of job losses, which could potentially dent sentiment days ahead a federal election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to secure a second term.
The government was forced to shelve a plan to sell its stake in state-run Air India last year after it failed to attract bids from investors in part due to the airline’s debt of over $5 billion.
Even as Jet’s lenders approved a bailout plan, there is no decision yet on whether the interim loan of $218 million would be given to the airline, a source has told Reuters, forcing Jet to further delay payments and dues.
About six lessors are expected to apply to India’s aviation regulator over the next few days to de-register up to 15 planes that have already been grounded, a source has told Reuters.
Jet’s lenders said last week they would consider other options should the stake-sale process “not result in an acceptable outcome”. Reuters"

“I met Masayoshi-san last week where he gave his unlimited support to power our growth.”
In a giddy press release Grab announced that it’s super-sizing its current funding round to US$6.5bil. 
Series H has already raised US$4.5bil, including US$1.46bil from Masayoshi Son’s (pic) SoftBank Vision Fund, and it plans to collect another US$2bil before the year is out. When funding rounds start getting past a Series F, you can be sure that, if nothing else, that startup has become very, very good at one thing: burning money (and, to be fair, raising money). 
What Grab failed to do, however, is show how having large tanks of kerosene to burn begets a sustainable business. 
That makes this bluster look a lot like Asia’s bike-rental wars, and we all know that didn’t turn out well. 
We shouldn’t be surprised that it’s Masa once again feeding the frenzy given his reputation as a big-stack bully.
Perhaps that oversight is because the true audience for this press release wasn’t the news media, nor industry partners, investors, customers or drivers. 
This press release may have well been addressed, “Dear Go-Jek.”
Just days prior, the Indonesian ride-hailing-cum-delivery service was reported as being added to CB Insight’s decacorn list - meaning its valuation had hit US$10bil.
Grab is valued at US$11bil on the same list. That must really grate. 
In two separate quotes, Grab executives make the claim that it’s four times bigger than its nearest competitor, and has 62% of Indonesia’s ride-hailing market. 
And what better way to show off your might than raise more money to throw onto your bonfire of the vanities.
Grab seems so desperate to appear superior that it’s taken to labeling itself
“Southeast Asia’s leading super app” - as if merely saying so will turn a ride-hailing company into the region’s WeChat.
In a bygone era, venture capital funding helped a group of entrepreneurs get off the ground and create a product. 
That cash would help manufacture a prototype, code up a viable software product, or build out some basic infrastructure upon which revenue would then be generated.
Today, this funding is mostly spent on marketing in the form of ads or incentives.
In the new-economy taxi business, those funds are often spent to close the gap between what a consumer is willing to pay for a ride and what a driver is willing to be paid to ferry that customer. 
The blind belief that collating a huge customer list will eventually result in a profitable company is undermined by last month’s IPO of Lyft Inc. 
The company’s losses are expected to widen this year, and it’s forecast to remain unprofitable through at least 2020, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The reliance on subsidies to lure consumers and drivers further muddies supply and demand dynamics, making it extremely difficult to estimate when, or whether, this business model can ever turn a profit.  (I have asked Grab for data to show its own economic analysis, but the company has declined to share it.)
Which is why Monday’s letter to Go-Jek is so stark.  This is an old-fashioned arms race, and Grab wants you (and Go-Jek) to know it’s got a bigger pile of munitions and the backing of the world’s venture-capital superpower. As long as that’s the case, expect the cash-burning haze over South-East Asia to grow thicker, and more toxic. – Bloomberg"

Saudi Arabia and Russia are members of the panel, which includes other major oil producers that took part in a global supply-cutting agreement last year, such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Nigeria and Kazakhstan.
“JMMC will be a key decision point because we will certainly by then know where the consensus view is and, more importantly, before we ask for consensus, we will know where the fundamentals are pointing,” the Saudi minister, Khalid al-Falih, said.
“I think May is going to be key,” he added.
Oil inventories remain higher than average but the market is on its way towards rebalancing, Falih added. “I don’t think we will need (to do more) ... the market is on its way towards balance. We have done a lot more than others,” Falih said. We are getting to a stage where inventories are starting to stabilise and come down but still significantly above what I would consider a normal level.”

In tonnage terms, last month’s inflow was 11.2 tonnes, following the addition of 9.95 tonnes in February, 11.8 tonnes in January and 9.95 tonnes in December.China, the world’s top gold producer and consumer, is facing signs of a slowing economy, even as progress is being made in trade negotiations with the US. The latest data from the PBoC indicate that the country has resumed adding gold to its reserves at a steady pace, much like the period from mid-2015 to October 2016, when the country boosted holdings almost every month. Should China continue to accumulate bullion at the current rate over 2019, it may end the year as the top buyer after Russia, which added 274 tonnes in 2018.Last year’s bullion buying by emerging-market central banks was the most robust in a long time as countries diversified reserves, Ed Morse, Citigroup Inc’s global head of commodities research, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.

At sugar conferences at the moment people talk of low European prices, but in the real world prices have firmed up quite a bit and should continue to do so,” said John Stansfield, a sugar analyst at Group Sopex.The rise in prices follows a poor EU harvest that has left output for the 2018/19 season at around 18 million tonnes, down some 3 million tonnes from 2017/18. The 2019/20 EU harvest is also seen at around 18 million tonnes following reduced beet plantings.EU sugar stocks meanwhile slumped to 12.7 million tonnes at the end of January from 15.2 million a year earlier, European Commission data shows.“The EU market is gradually turning into a balanced situation, which is encouraging. Nobody is making money at these prices,” said Julian Price, consultant at julianprice.com and former trader at ED&F Man.Suedzucker, which plans to reduce output by 700,000 tonnes per year starting next season, expects to make another operating loss in its sugar segment of 200-300 million euros in 2019/20. France’s Tereos, the world’s second-largest sugar maker, expects a full-year loss for 2018/19.Agritel analyst Francois Thaury said the EU spot price rise was for now hurting regional sugar makers, many of which sold forward expecting a bumper crop and have been left scrambling for spot supplies to fill sales obligations.They should eventually benefit, he said, but noted that EU sugar imports were also rising, meaning prices were capped and could come off the boil.Sugar imports into the EU were at 163,000 tonnes in January, around double the year-earlier level, European Commission data shows. Although the imports are capped by a tariff regime, allocated tariff-free flows can still work to cool the market.For the non-EU market, reduced output in a key consuming region such as Europe comes as welcome relief to exporters scrambling for new markets.Analysts expect the global sugar market to record a deficit of 1.9 million tonnes in 2019/20, but following years of surplus, stockpiles are plentiful, keeping prices stubbornly range-bound near decade lows. — Reuters"

The CBP spokesman said the forced labor unit could draw from those larger resources, if needed.President Donald Trump last month submitted his proposed 2020 federal budget to Congress, which calls for a substantial increase to CBP’s budget as a whole, adding nearly 800 jobs and more than US$4bil. Congress is working on its own proposal.Toys, cotton, fishThe Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA) plugs a loophole in a 1930 law that banned slave-made goods but left an exemption for products the United States could not make.The law allows CBP to stop goods entering the United States based solely on “reasonable suspicion” about its origins.A company hit with a “withhold release order” can decide to reroute the shipment and try to sell their products elsewhere, or persuade CBP to change its decision by providing documents to demonstrate due diligence and argue the goods are slavery-free.CBP can go further, seizing cargos and pursuing civil penalties against companies if it has enough evidence to meet the heavier legal burden of “probable cause”.All such decisions are subject to appeal in courts.The agency also works with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which can begin a criminal investigation based on its own assessment of any cases that are referred by the CBP.After a barren 2017, CBP last year issued two withhold release orders – toys from China and cotton from Turkmenistan.Turkmen cotton – and any products made with the fiber – were hit with a blanket ban by CBP last year due to findings of state-enforced slave labour in its picking.So far, in 2019, one fishing vessel has been detained. The value of its cargo has not been added to the US$6.3mil total.The Department of Labor lists 419 products in 75 countries as being made with either forced labour or child labour, or both.Overall, 25 million people around the world are trapped in forced labor, according to the International Labour Organisation.ObstaclesAbout six of CBP’s 62,450 staff are dedicated to tackling the entry of slave-made goods into the nation, the agency said.These investigators begin probes based on tips from advocacy group or the general public, or from their own initiative.“There’s some really good people – staff – that have been reaching out to different NGOs, including ours, and that is really encouraging,” said Neha Misra, who works on human trafficking for the Solidarity Centre in Washington, DC. But CBP faces legal limitations concerning its powers.In most circumstances, the agency can only take action against specific shipments from specific locations or companies – rather than enforcing a blanket ban on a whole sector.In the case of the toys made in China, the withhold release order is only for toys made by a specific manufacturer, not the entire Chinese toy sector, whatever suspicions are held by CBP.The same is true of all the other individual products that have had action taken against them, except for Turkmen cotton.Despite the limited impact to-date, forced labour and trade experts say they are positive about CBP’s recent progress.“They’re not an agency that’s used to looking for forced labour in supply chains,” said Annick Febrey, head of government and corporate relations at the Human Trafficking Institute.“I think they’re building the case now for products they know are at significant risk,” Febrey added. “I’m hopeful that we’ll see more. The impact so far has been minimal.” — Reuters"

“Shell buys these credits from a global portfolio of nature-based projects. Each carbon credit is subject to a third-party verification process and represents the avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide,” Shell said.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/moodys-additional-capital-rule-for-important-banks-credit-positive/,Moody's: Additional capital rule for important banks credit positive,Banking,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",3:59 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR:  Bank Negara Malaysia's proposed additional capital requirement for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) is credit positive, Moody's Investors Service says.

The proposal would increase Malaysia’s largest banks' ability to absorb potential shocks and enhance banking system stability amid challenging operating conditions, the rating agency said in a statement on Monday.

On April 3, the central bank, held a public consultation on the proposed designation of D-SIBs and the implementation of higher loss absorbency requirements for them. 

Under the proposed framework, banks designated as D-SIBs would have to maintain an additional capital buffer of 0.5%-1.0% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital relative to risk-weighted assets (RWAs) on a consolidated group basis. 

The proposed D-SIB buffer would complement other CET1 capital requirements implemented this year, such as the countercyclical capital buffer and capital conservation buffer.

“Assuming all six of the Moody's-rated Malaysian banks are designated as D-SIBs, we expect all of them would comfortably meet the higher capital requirement without having to raise additional capital because they maintain buffers well above the new minimum regulatory capital levels,” it said. 

Moody's said the CET1 capital ratios of all six banks were more than 300 basis points above the 8% minimum CET1 ratio (including a 1% D-SIB capital buffer) at year-end 2018.

“In addition, we expect the banks’ internal capital generation to remain sound and outpace capital consumption over the next 12-18 months because of sluggish loan growth and weak market sentiment,” it said.

To identify D-SIBs, Bank Negara would use the criteria of size, interconnectedness and substitutability to determine the degree of a bank’s systemic importance and the effect that its failure would have on the domestic financial system and economy. 

“Bank Negara has not determined the implementation date of the proposal. Bank Negara proposes an annual review of designated D-SIBs to divide the banks into three groups and calibrate D-SIB buffers of 0.5%-2.0% depending on the banks’ relative systemic importance. 

“As proposed, a 1.0% capital buffer would apply to D-SIBs of greater systemic importance, and a 0.5% capital buffer would apply to the other D-SIBs. The 2.0% capital buffer would not apply to any of the D-SIBs at the start of the policy implementation, but allows for higher capital requirements at the discretion of Bank Negara,” Moody's said."

Jacintha Poh, a Moody's vice president and senior credit officer said the dividend cash flows to the parent company Genting Bhd would not be be impacted by the higher capital spending.

Moody's had on Monday affirmed the Baa1 issuer rating of Genting Bhd. At the same time, it affirmed the Baa1 issuer rating of Genting Bhd's unit Genting Overseas Holdings Ltd (GOHL) and the Baa1 backed senior unsecured rating of the notes issued by GOHL Capital Ltd.

“The outlook on the ratings is stable,” said Poh, who is also Moody's lead analyst for Genting Bhd. 

To recap, on April 3, 2019, Genting Bhd's 49%-owned Genting Malaysia Bhd  (GenM) announced the proposed acquisition of a super yacht -- Equanimity -- for US$126mil (RM515mil) for completion this year.

Genting Bhd's 53%-owned Genting Singapore Ltd (GenS, A3 stable) had on April 3 announced that it would invest S$4.5bil (RM13.5bil) to expand Resorts World Sentosa (RWS).

The expansion of RWS will be delivered in phases with new experiences opening every year from 2020 to a projected completion time around 2025.

Poh pointed out the latest capital spending plans, which do not require debt funding, will not hurt GENB's credit metrics. 

“However we continue to expect that Genting Bhd's credit metrics will weaken over the next 12-18 months owing to the group's debt-funded capital spending for the development of Resorts World Las Vegas,"" Poh said.

She said Genting Bhd had limited headroom to accommodate further increase in debt until the construction of Resorts World Las Vegas completes and the new integrated resort starts contributing to the group's earnings, which is unlikely to be before 2021.

Moody's expects Genting Bhd's capital spending to rise significantly to around RM11bil per annum in 2019 and 2020, from RM6bil in 2018.

More than half of this capital spending will relate to the development of Resorts World Las Vegas, which will be funded by the remaining proceeds from GOHL's US$1.5bil bonds issued in 2017 and Resorts World Las Vegas LCC's latest funding programmes -- the US$1bil bond priced on April 2, 2019 and the US$1.6bil secured credit facilities.

Moody's expects Genting Bhd's leverage, as measured by adjusted debt/EBITDA, will weaken to around 3.8 times in 2019 and 3.7 times in 2020, from 3.4 times in 2018. Retained cash flow (RCF)/debt will likely weaken to around 12% in both 2019 and 2020, from 16% over the same period.

As of Dec 31, 2018, Genting Bhd had maintained a sizeable cash position of RM31bil compared to gross balance sheet debt  of RM29bil.

However, over 65% of the group's cash are held at three majority-owned and listed subsidiaries – GenS, GenM and 52%-owned Genting Plantations  Bhd -- therefore limiting its ability to access the funds in their entirety.

“While Moody's expects Genting Bhd to generate annual operating cash flows of around RM5.5bil over the next 12 months, more than sufficient to cover short-term debt repayments of RM1.9bil, the group will turn into a net debt position in 2019 as cash is being used to fund multiple development projects across its listed subsidiaries.""

""Genting Bhd's Baa1 rating reflects Moody's expectation of stable consolidated cash flow generation from the group's monopoly gaming operation in  Malaysia and duopoly gaming operation in Singapore, as well as the group's track record of maintaining excellent consolidated liquidity with  sizable cash holdings and a well-managed debt maturity profile.

“The outlook on the rating is stable, reflecting Moody's expectation that Genting Bhd will exercise financial prudence during its current expansion phase and will maintain strong financial flexibility with ample liquidity reserves,” it said."

This is a Shariah-compliant equity fund seeks to provide a stable income stream with medium to long-term capital growth, it said in a statement on Monday. The initial offer period for the fund is for 21 days and will close on April 28.

The units of the fund are at 50 sen per unit during its initial offer period. The minimum initial investment is RM1,000.

The fund was launched to meet the demands of investors with the appetite for medium to long-term equity income funds.

Although the fund will be a Shariah-compliant version of the company’s equity income fund, the fund managers will adopt the same investment philosophy of stock picking.

“We will generally pick companies with good quality management, which are able to deliver stable earnings growth and have sustainable dividend yields backed by strong cash flow generation,”  Doreen Choo, chief investment officer, Eastspring Investments Bhd said.  

“This strategy is intended to provide steady recurring income, as well as capital appreciation over the medium to longer-term,” she said.

Raymond Tang, CEO of Eastspring Investments Bhd said Eastspring was a valuation and research-driven house with good fundamental stock-picking skills and a disciplined portfolio construction process.

“We believe our investment philosophy can potentially generate consistent and attractive returns for our clients over the long run.  The team’s vast experience and strong drive enables us to add value during periods of market volatility,” Tang said.
 
On the outlook for Malaysia's stock market, Choo said: “We are optimistic about Malaysia’s long-term market outlook, but remain cautious over the near-term given the many challenges. Volatility is the new norm, be it from domestic politics or policies, made more challenging by external noises from the ongoing US-China trade war, US monetary policies and volatilities in commodities. 

“As such, we will focus on companies with strong fundamentals and good track record of adapting well even in challenging environments,”  she said.
 
Eastspring Investments managed over US$193bil assets as at Dec 31, 2018 on behalf of institutional and retail clients. It is the Asian asset management business of Prudential plc, one of the world’s largest financial services companies.
 
In Malaysia, Eastspring Investments Bhd has about RM39.30bil in assets under management as at Dec 31, 2018."

The letter was sent to the EU over the weekend, said Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating minister for maritime affairs, who also oversees natural resources issues. He declined to disclose the content of the letter.

Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's top producers of the vegetable oil, have both threatened a World Trade Organization challenge against the EU over its plan to stop the use of palm oil by 2030 in renewable transport fuel.

An Indonesian delegation arrived in Brussels for an official visit this week ""as a response to the EU's discriminatory policy"", the country's Coordinating Economic Ministry said in a separate statement on Monday.

The Indonesian delegates were part of a joint mission of the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries, which consists of Indonesia, Malaysia and Colombia.

""The main purpose of the joint mission is to convey disappointment and to fight the delegated act that has been adopted by the European Commission,"" the statement said.

Last month, the European Commission determined that palm has resulted in excessive deforestation and its use should be phased out.

The EU plans to increase its use of renewable energy sources and to take into account deforestation when it determines what can be labelled renewable.

Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer, argues that rather than promoting sustainability in the vegetable oil sector, the regulation is more about protecting and promoting the European Union's home-grown vegetable oils.

European spirits makers said last week they are facing difficulties exporting drinks to Indonesia amid rising tension over palm, but an Indonesian official denied that it was a retaliation against EU's renewable energy policy. - Reuters"

A joint OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial committee known as the JMMC is due to meet in May. Saudi Arabia and Russia are members of the panel, which includes other major oil producers that took part in a global supply-cutting agreement last year, such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Nigeria and Kazakhstan.

""JMMC will be a key decision point because we will certainly by then know where the consensus view is and, more importantly, before we ask for consensus, we will know where the fundamentals are pointing,"" said Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih.

""I think May is going to be key,"" he added.

Oil inventories remain higher than average but the market is on its way towards rebalancing, Falih said.

""I don't think we will need (to do more) ... the market is on its way towards balance. We have done a lot more than others,"" he added, referring to the possibility of Saudi Arabia cutting output further below its target under the global deal.

""We are getting to a stage where inventories are starting to stabilise and come down but still significantly above what I would consider a normal level.""

Russia, which is cutting oil output in tandem with OPEC, also said production cuts would stay in place at least until June, when Washington's next steps on reducing Iranian and Venezuelan oil exports become clearer.

NO CHANGE IN TRADING CURRENCY

The United States has been increasing its own crude exports steeply and U.S. President Donald Trump has been pressing OPEC to lower the oil price by boosting production.

U.S. policies targeting Iran and Venezuela have introduced a new level of uncertainty for OPEC as the producer group struggles to predict global supply and demand. Washington is also advancing a bill, known as NOPEC, that could expose OPEC members to U.S. antitrust lawsuits.

The NOPEC move prompted Saudi Arabia to threaten to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if Washington passes the bill, three sources familiar with Saudi energy policy told Reuters last week.

However, the kingdom's energy ministry on Monday said the report was “inaccurate” and does not reflect its position on the matter.

""The Kingdom has been trading its oil in dollars for decades, which has served the objectives of its financial and monetary policies well,” the ministry said in a statement.

It added that Saudi Arabia would not risk its key policy priority -- as a stabilising force for global energy markets -- through a fundamental change to the financial terms of oil trading in its relationships around the world.

Falih also told reporters at an oil event in Riyadh that there was no change to the kingdom's policy of trading oil in U.S. dollars.

""Absolutely not. There is no change whatsoever to our long-standing policy,"" Falih said.

The United Arab Emirates' energy minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, also said that the use of the dollar as the main oil-trading currency could not be changed overnight. - Reuters"

The mega funding comes as Grab rolls out an aggressive strategy to expand its bouquet of services, from transport to food delivery and payments, as it races Indonesia's Go-Jek to become an app-for-everything in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people.

Grab, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank, expects to invest a significant portion of the funds in Indonesia, it said in a statement later. Reuters reported the funding target earlier on Monday.

""We basically received a very strong vote of confidence. And Masa shared that SoftBank is very happy with Grab and that SoftBank will provide unlimited support to power our growth,"" Tan said, referring to SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son.

SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment.

Funding, to be raised from strategic investors, including SoftBank, will be a mix of debt and equity, Tan said.

Grab's ongoing massive financing round started soon after it bought the Southeast Asian operations of U.S. peer Uber in March last year.

The Singapore-headquartered firm, like its regional rival Go-Jek, has been raising billions of dollars to bring ride-hailing, food delivery, e-commerce and banking to a populous region with a growing number of consumers that use smartphones to commute, shop and make payments.

Both firms started out in ride-hailing and have since amassed millions of users with cut-rate prices.

Backers for Go-Jek include Temasek Holdings, Tencent and Alphabet Inc's Google.

Grab counts Toyota, Microsoft, China's Didi Chuxing and Hyundai among its backers.

People with direct knowledge of the matter said Grab has raised about $8 billion since its launch almost 7 years ago.

Last month, Grab's president Ming Maa, a former SoftBank executive, said the ride-hailing firm was considering raising more funds in its ongoing financing round, in which the SoftBank Vision Fund has invested $1.5 billion.

Tan said: ""With the amount of funding we have raised, and the support from strategic investors like SoftBank, we are so well-funded to execute on our expansion and investment plans, so there is really no need to IPO.""

Grab wants to make at least six investments or acquisitions this year, and plans to add 1,000 tech staff globally, Tan said.

In Singapore, it will double staff to 3,000 when its $134-million headquarters is complete by end-2020.

SoftBank's support will help Grab ""grow very aggressively this year across our verticals - transport, mobility, food and payments"", Tan told Reuters in an interview. ($1 = 1.3559 Singapore dollars). - Reuters"

Led by a strong surge in foreign purchase of Malaysian bonds, the country recorded a net foreign fund inflow of RM3.8bil in the first quarter of this year, marking a significant improvement from a net outflow of RM2.8bil in the fourth quarter of 2018 (4Q18).
According to United Overseas Bank (Malaysia) Bhd senior economist Julia Goh, the domestic bond market saw an inflow of RM5.1bil in 1Q19, which has offset equity outflows of RM1.3bil.
Foreign flows into the Malaysian bonds rose from only RM400mil in 4Q18 to RM5.1bil in 1Q19, while foreign outflow from the equities reduced by more than half from RM3.2bil in 4Q18 to RM1.3bil in 1Q19.
For the month of March, Goh pointed out that foreign investors bought RM2.9bil of Malaysian debt securities, lower than RM4.5bil in Feb. This marks the second month of net buying, which brings cumulative flows to RM5.1bil in 1Q19.
“In March 2019, foreigners bought Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) and Government Investment Issues (GII) of RM1.4bil and RM1.3bil respectively (Feb: -RM4.9bil and RM800mil). Foreign holdings of government bonds (MGS and GII) edged up to RM169bil or 22.8% of total outstanding (Feb: RM167bil or 22.7%).
“Foreigners also bought RM300mil of Treasury bills (Feb: -RM800mil) against marginal net selling of private debt securities last month,” stated Goh in a note yesterday.
As for the Malaysian equities, foreign investors have continued to pare down their holdings by RM1.6bil in March as compared to a net selling of RM800mil in February.
Cumulatively, foreign net selling rose to RM1.3bil in 1Q19 and RM15.2bil since 2Q18.
On the ringgit outlook, Goh said that the US dollar-ringgit exchange rate will hover in a tight range of RM4.06 to RM4.08 per US dollar as growth risks take center stage.
“The Asian Development Bank predicted that growth in Asia’s developing economies will fall to its slowest pace in nearly two decades and the World Trade Organisation cut its global trade projection for 2019 to the lowest level in three years.

The largest hit came from sluggish demand in China, a sign that Japan’s recovery prospects would depend heavily on how quickly Beijing’s stimulus measures help prop up its economy.
BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the economy was expected to continue expanding moderately with robust domestic demand offsetting some of the weaknesses in exports.
But the central bank warned that weakening global growth and simmering Sino-US trade tensions were taking a toll on some Japanese regions reliant on overseas demand.
“We have had to cut our assessments on exports and output for some regions because we’re hearing more complaints about the impact of the global economic slowdown more than three months ago,” said a BoJ official briefing journalists on the quarterly report.
Aside downgrading its economic assessment for three regions, the BoJ raised its assessment for one, and it maintained its view for five.
On output, the BoJ cut its assessment for seven out of the nine regions – the biggest number of downgrades since 2013 – due to weakening demand for semiconductor and machinery.
The BoJ expected the economy to continue expanding moderately and points to resilient capital expenditure as a sign the pain from weakening global growth will not push Japan into recession.
But the report cited several companies that put off investment in new equipment due to uncertainty over the global outlook.
“We decided to forgo a plan to build a new semi-conductor equipment plant as Sino-US trade frictions heighten uncertainty over the global economy,” a machinery maker in Kumamoto, southern Japan, was quoted as saying.
Another company in Kofu, eastern Japan, said shrinking demand for Chinese equipment forced it to slash production by up to 40%  from a year earlier, according to the report.
But Yasuhiro Yamada, head of the BoJ’s branch manager in Osaka, western Japan, said many companies in his region believe China’s stimulus measures would help boost demand around the latter half of this year.
“If external demand picks up while domestic demand is still strong, we can expect output to rebound from a temporary soft patch,” Yamada told a news conference.
The report will be among factors the BoJ will scrutinise when it meets for a rate review on April 24-25.
Exports fell for a third straight month in February and industrial output in January saw its sharpest decline in a year, stoking fears Japan could slide into recession.
And yet, many BoJ policymakers are reluctant to ramp up stimulus as years of massive money printing have left the central bank with a dearth of policy ammunition. —Reuters"

Economies in the 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations “and Asean as a group both continue to grow quite well even this year and next,” Heng told Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on the sidelines of meetings of the regional bloc in Chiang Rai, Thailand. 
“There will still be growth even though the growth will be uneven across the world and it’ll be slower than before.”
Global growth has lost momentum since the beginning of the year, a knock for trade-reliant nations in South-East Asia, especially Singapore. For now, regional growth seems to be holding up, with the Asian Development Bank forecasting 4.9% expansion in 2019.
In Singapore, authorities see growth easing to slightly below the midpoint of a 1.5% to 3.5% range this year, after reaching 3.3% in 2018, with inflation remaining benign. Heng said the growth forecast isn’t being revised at this stage.
The finance minister reiterated that a potential worsening of the US-China trade war is a risk to the global economy, with the two powers yet to ink an agreement that would relieve any of the tariffs put in place on US$360bil in goods. 
Brexit uncertainties and a general malaise among workers about how to adapt amid rapid technological change also weigh on world growth prospects.
“The investment sentiment has been affected, uncertainty has increased,” said Heng. “For investors making long-term investments, making major investments, they would adopt a wait-and-see approach, and this can in turn affect sentiments further.”
In South-East Asia, regional economies are benefiting as companies adjust supply chains to take account of rising tariffs in the United States. and China, Heng said.
Conversations with investors “have been generally quite positive, still,” Heng said.
“There is a sense that the global supply chain is re-configuring quite rapidly and now people are thinking about the resilience of the supply chain,” which means diversification and movement of operations to Asean economies, he said.
Heng said he’s heard from logistics operators who report a “far higher volume of business” as they move heavy machinery and goods from around the region.
Fiscal and monetary authorities have a smaller margin for managing economic problems after taking unconventional policy measures in the aftermath of the last financial crisis, Heng said.
The minister also made the following comments in his interview: “US-China tensions aren’t a one-off dispute as intellectual property rights and broader competition over technology will continue; there will be many ups and downs in the coming months and years.
“I’m hopeful that good sense will prevail and there will be a deal between the United States and China. The signals are more positive recently on their trade talks.”
Officials at Asean meetings agreed to share more “threat intelligence” around cyber-security issues, and to reinforce basic security practices at ministries such as resetting passwords.

In a statement yesterday, the International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) said the investments would mainly be in key projects within the electrical and electronics (E&E) as well as chemical industries.
The mission, which was held from April 1-6, was co-organised by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida), Malaysia External Trade Development Corp (Matrade) and InvestKL Corp.
“Covering the cities of Washington DC, New York, Seattle and San Jose, Darell held several bilateral discussions with senior US government officials to strengthen trade and economic relationships between the two countries,” Miti said.
It said a series of high level meetings were also held with potential US investors in the manufacturing and services sectors, such as chemical, E&E, aerospace, tourism, support services for business aviation, as well as centre of excellence for financial services.
Meanwhile, Miti said during the mission, Darell was also interviewed by several international media agencies, in which he commented that both the United States and China had a global responsibility to resolve their differences amicably, as their actions would impact all economies and the global supply chain. 
“The minister also delivered key messages on investment opportunities in Malaysia,” it said.
Other than that, Miti said specific discussions on potential investments in data centres were also being held during the mission, with Microsoft Corp and Mimos Bhd, an agency under Miti, agreeing to establish the Centre of Artificial Intelligence for Future Industry in Malaysia.
In conjunction with the mission, the ministry said a seminar themed “Forging Stronger Economic Relationships between Malaysia and the US” was also organised in San Jose, California, which attracted over 150 participants in the manufacturing and services sectors.  
The seminar provided an update on the current economic situation and highlighted investment opportunities and potential business cooperation available in Malaysia, it added.
“The minister also had the opportunity to network with successful Malaysian professionals based in the Silicon Valley as well as witnessed the exchange of a memorandum of understanding on collaboration and development of professional programmes in the areas of AI, Internet of Things, robotics, blockchain and financial technology,” Miti said. — Bernama"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/09/moodys-dsibs-move-credit-positive/,Moody’s: D-SIBs move credit positive,Banking,"Tuesday, 9 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR:  Bank Negara’s proposed additional capital requirement for domestic, systemically important banks (D-SIBs) is credit positive, Moody’s Investors Service says.
The proposal would increase Malaysia’s largest banks’ ability to absorb potential shocks and enhance banking system stability amid challenging operating conditions, the rating agency said in a statement yesterday.
On April 3, the central bank, held a public consultation on the proposed designation of D-SIBs and the implementation of higher loss absorbency requirements for them. 
Under the proposed framework, banks designated as D-SIBs would have to maintain an additional capital buffer of 0.5%-1.0% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital relative to risk-weighted assets (RWAs) on a consolidated group basis. 
The proposed D-SIB buffer would complement other CET1 capital requirements implemented this year, such as the countercyclical capital buffer and capital conservation buffer.
“Assuming all six of the Moody’s-rated Malaysian banks are designated as D-SIBs, we expect all of them would comfortably meet the higher capital requirement without having to raise additional capital because they maintain buffers well above the new minimum regulatory capital levels,” it said. 
Moody’s said the CET1 capital ratios of all six banks were more than 300 basis points above the 8% minimum CET1 ratio (including a 1% D-SIB capital buffer) at year-end 2018. “In addition, we expect the banks’ internal capital generation to remain sound and outpace capital consumption over the next 12-18 months because of sluggish loan growth and weak market sentiment,” it said.
To identify D-SIBs, Bank Negara would use the criteria of size, interconnectedness and substitutability to determine the degree of a bank’s systemic importance and the effect that its failure would have on the domestic financial system and economy. 
“Bank Negara has not determined the implementation date of the proposal.
“Bank Negara proposes an annual review of designated D-SIBs to divide the banks into three groups and calibrate D-SIB buffers of 0.5%-2.0% depending on the banks’ relative systemic importance. 
“As proposed, a 1.0% capital buffer would apply to D-SIBs of greater systemic importance, and a 0.5% capital buffer would apply to the other D-SIBs. 
“The 2.0% capital buffer would not apply to any of the D-SIBs at the start of the policy implementation, but allows for higher capital requirements at the discretion of Bank Negara,” Moody’s said."

MSM Malaysia Holdings Bhd  is nearing the final stages of discussions to set up partnerships in China’s downstream sugar industry, executive director Datuk Khairil Anuar Aziz said. 
The refiner is looking to sell sugar for popular snacks such as bubble tea, health drinks and bread, as well as healthier sweeteners, condensed milk and molasses used in alcohol.
There’s “opportunity if you really blend it with the current lifestyle of people” in China, Khairil said in an interview at the company headquarters here last week. 
“We really want to provide sugar to all these different industries – bakeries, bubble tea, healthy drinks. The demand is there.”
MSM’s wager on China follows a tumultuous time for the global sugar market, which has been one of the worst performing commodities in recent years. 
The more-than 40% plunge in futures in the past two years has hurt firms from Germany’s Suedzucker AG to major Singaporean food trader Olam International Ltd. MSM hasn’t gone unscathed either, with dwindling sales leading to a quarterly loss and share prices tumbling to a record low yesterday.
MSM is hoping China can help turn things around. 
The refiner, the world’s sixth largest for standalone capacity at 2.25 million tonnes per year, sees China as Asia’s next biggest sugar market as the younger generation become increasingly busy and pick up easy to eat sugary snacks on the go.
Consumption in China is forecast to rise in the year ending September 2019 to more than 15 million tonnes, according to its ministry of agriculture, while the OECD forecasts the country to become the world’s leading sugar importer by 2027.
MSM also expects sugar prices to improve in the second half of 2019 as the global supply glut moves into a deficit, albeit a small one, according to Khairil. 
Raw sugar prices for export may average 14 US cents a pound this year, as Brazil converts more of the commodity into ethanol and crop-unfriendly weather in some of India’s sugar producing regions cuts into supplies, Khairil said. 
Sugar in New York traded at 12.76 US cents a pound yesterday.
Recovering prices, as well as forecasts for a stronger ringgit, should help MSM shore up cash for new investments, Khairil said.
“We’re looking for the market to balance out,” Khairil said. “A deficit in global raw sugar will give us a little breather.” — Bloomberg"

In a note, Affin Hwang Capital research said the group was looking to launch a new product pipeline focused on ""small-ticket items"" to aknowledge the shift in market demand.

It added that it was also looking to revamp its recruitment and retention programme in 2019 to revilalise its depressed distributor base.

To recap, Hai-O's 9MFY19 results were below Affin Hwang's and consensus expectations and the MLM segment's performance remained lacklustre, dropping 35% year-on-year.

""Management experienced challenges with membership attrition (falling from a peak of 160k distributors) following the company’s 25th anniversary grand sales promotion in 1HFY18, alongside persisting weakness in the market,"" the researc house said.

The group's wholesale and retail segments performed better but contributed only about 26% of group EBIT for the financial year to date.

Affin Hwang expects more volatile performances for the group in 2019 despite the management's response to the underlying market conditions. 

However, it expects a stronger 4Q for the group due to seasonally better performance for the MLM segment.

The research house maintained its hold call on Hai-O with an unchanged target price of RM2.50.

FUNDAMENTALS
* Malaysian palm oil futures surged to their highest in six weeks on Friday evening, charting a fifth straight session of gains, on expectations of dwindling stockpiles and improved exports.
* U.S. soybean futures dropped on Friday as uncertainty about the timing and details of a potential trade deal with China caused investors to lock in some profits from recent gains, traders said.
* Oil prices rose to their highest levels since Nov. 2018 on Monday, driven up by OPEC's ongoing supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela.
MARKET NEWS
* Asian shares edged higher on Monday as investors cheered a much-needed rebound in U.S. payrolls, while looking forward to more policy stimulus in China.

International benchmark Brent futures were at $70.69 per barrel at 0047 GMT on Monday, up 35 cents, or 0.5 percent from their last close.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude were up 35 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $63.43 per barrel.

Brent and WTI both hit their highest levels since November last year at $70.76 and $63.48 per barrel, respectively, early on Monday.

""Brent prices increased more than 30 percent year-to-date as OPEC+ continued to cut supply for 4 months in a row and optimism over U.S.-China trade talks helped to buoy the demand outlook,"" U.S. bank J.P.Morgan said in a note released over the weekend.

Traders said strong U.S. jobs data from Friday also helped lift Asian markets early on Monday.

Energy consultancy FGE said OPEC-led supply cuts meant ""excess inventories are disappearing and the market looks healthy,"" adding that ""the market is poised for prices to rise to $75 per barrel or higher"" for Brent.

Oil prices have also been driven up by U.S. sanctions against OPEC-members Iran and Venezuela.

""Sanctions can cut 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan exports. Add that to a cut in Iran waivers and prices can rise substantially,"" FGE said.

There remain, however, some factors that could bring prices down later this year.

Russia is a reluctant participant in its agreement with OPEC to withhold output, and Russian oil production may increase again if a deal with the producer club is not extended once it expires before July 1, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday.

Russian oil output reached a record high of 556 million tonnes, or 11.16 million barrels per day (bpd), last year.

In the United States, crude oil production reached a record 12.2 million bpd in late March.

U.S. crude exports have also risen, breaking through 3 million bpd for the first time earlier this year.

""With the new Permian pipelines (from July), we can see a boost of 500,000 to 600,000 bpd in U.S. exports,"" FGE said.

There also still remain concerns about the health of the global economy, especially should China and the United States fail to resolve their trade dispute soon.

""Global (trade) demand has weakened, and existing tariffs on Chinese goods shipments to the U.S. are providing an additional drag,"" credit rating agency Moody's said on Monday, although it added that Chinese monetary stimulus measures would likely support growth over 2019. - Reuters"

The research house said on Monday while the improvement in its offshore vessels (OSV) utilisation this year is a given, the need to resolve its financial predicament is Icon’s key priority (net gearing level of 727% as at December 2018), which is set to be unveiled in 3Q19. 

“Also, daily charter rate (DCR), which is at its historical trough now, needs to rise to warrant a re-rating,” it said.

Maybank Research pointed out Icon has announced the three plus one plus one year charter of five AHTS for the Petronas Integrated Logistics Control Tower (ILCT) contracts and (ii) one straight supply vessel (SSV) for PCSB’s six plus six months contract. 

Icon has deployed these OSVs, namely Tigris, Marissa, Azra, Lotus and Sophia for the former (3 units to PCSB and one each for Hess and IPC) since Sep 2018, on a call-out basis and Tanjung Pinang 2 for the latter since March 2019. The DCRs are to be in the RM21,000 to RM23,000 range for these vessels.     
   
“While the OSV market, especially the domestic segment, has improved, premised on Petronas’ Activity Outlook report, our earnings estimates are unchanged. 

“We expect Icon to remain in the red in 2019, on an average OSV utilisation of 60% (vs. 56% for 2018). Its DCRs, which are at a historical trough, need to rise to reflect a cyclical recovery. Icon needs to achieve a 62% utilisation just to be P&L break-even,” it said.  

Similar to most of its OSV peers, Icon is in the Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC) scheme too to address its balance sheet (i.e. de-gear/ refinance and restructure its debts). 

Its proposed restructuring scheme, which is currently in progress, is scheduled to be announced in 3Q19. 

“The urgent need to restructure takes precedence over any prospect of an earnings turnaround or fleet rejuvenation exercise. The age profile of its OSV fleet averages around 10 years old,” said Maybank Research."

Kenanga noted that BJToto's share price gained 25% year-to-date due to the improving ticket sales amid strong advances in other sin stocks such as Magnum, Carlsberg and Heineken.

Outside of Malaysia, earnings from the group's Philippine-based PGMC and UK unit HR Owen could be volatile. 

Pre-tax profit from PGMC fell to RM5.2mil in 3Q19 from RM22.7mil in 2Q19 owing to lower leased rental income as the contract for the lottery system machine expired last August.

Earnings from HRO were volatile given the auto sales value coupled with the volitility of the pound sterling.

Lynas, the world’s only major producer of rare earths outside China, has been locked in a dispute with the South East Asian nation, which has told it to remove years of accumulated waste as a condition of renewing its licence in September.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday that companies interested in acquiring Lynas had pledged to remove low-level radioactivity before shipping raw materials to the country.

Mahathir did not specify which companies were interested in Lynas. The company last month rejected a $1.1 billion takeover approach by Australian retail-to-chemicals conglomerate Wesfarmers.

Lynas said on Monday that for some months it has been developing detailed plans that would assist the company to mitigate risk from any regulatory changes in Malaysia.

“We see value in operating alternative cracking and leaching processing close to our resource,” it said in a statement, Lynas mines rare earths at Mount Weld in Western Australia and currently ships the concentrated material to an $800 million processing plant in Kuantan, Malaysia, where it stores thousands of tonnes of waste.

Initial ore processing in Australia to lower levels of radioactivity would mean building a cracking and leaching plant at a cost of about A$100 million over three years, according to a research report by brokerage CLSA.

Mahathir said even Lynas could operate in the country as long as raw materials coming to Malaysia were cleaned.

“A partial resolution to the political uncertainty has been reached which will bring forward plans to build a cracking plant in Australia,” CLSA said.

Wesfarmers said that it welcomed comments by the Malaysian government.

“It is consistent with prior public statements by the government and the views shared with us in meetings with senior Malaysian government officials since we announced our proposal to acquire Lynas,” it said in a statement.

“We look forward to more detail from the government about Lynas’ operating licence certainty, to assess the conditionality of our proposal.”

Lynas said its Japanese lenders and customers had pledged their support for the company and its management. It was seeking further clarification from the Malaysian government.

In December, Malaysia’s Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) told Lynas that it must export stockpiles of a type of residue from its processing plant by Sept. 2, when its full operating stage licence is due for renewal.

In February, Lynas said that exporting the residue within the mandated timeline was ”unachievable”. - Reuters"

The liquefied petroleum gas cargo aboard Clipper Sun is expected to arrive at Ennore on the South Asian nation’s east coast on April 11, according to shipping data and intelligence firm Kpler SAS.

At least three more tankers are headed to India from the U.S., the first cases of “direct LPG shipments on this route,” Kpler said in an emailed report on Friday. 

About 95 percent of the South Asian country’s LPG imports come from the Middle East, mostly Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

The shipments open up a new market for U.S. LPG as America’s trade war with China has almost drained exports to that Asian market. Meanwhile, India is scouting for supplies to meet soaring demand as cargoes from the Middle East shrink as a consequence of the deal between OPEC members and their allies to reduce crude production. The scramble for shipments has boosted premiums for the fuel.

“We see the U.S. taking the incremental market share from Saudi Arabia,” Thomas Olney, a Singapore-based analyst at industry consultant FGE said, adding that the kingdom is able to sell to China at a “very substantial premium.” That’s “forced India to source cargoes from further away,” he said.

Cargo Demand

India’s three state-oil companies issued rare spot tenders seeking more than half a million tons of LPG for delivery in March and April, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 

The country usually purchases cargoes containing equal quantities of propane and butane gases, byproducts of crude production and refining. The U.S. primarily exports propane.

However, butane export capacity in the U.S. is set to increase in the second half of this year. Enterprise Products Partners LP, one of the biggest operators of American petroleum export terminals, is expanding its Houston facility, which will become operational this year and be able to switch between propane and butane loadings. 

Another exporter, Targa Resources Corp., also expects higher volumes for overseas shipments.

“This year, all things being equal and if tariffs imposed by China remain in place, India will have to turn to the U.S. to provide the incremental cargoes,” Olney said. - Bloomberg"

He said the factors include the United States (US) federal government’s temporary shutdown which lasted for 35 days, from Dec 22, 2018, to January 25 this year -- the longest government shutdown in the US history.

Mohd Radzi said the shutdown affected the US’ economic growth, which indirectly affected the world’s economic growth during the first quarter of 2019.

“Additionally, the uncertainties in the US’ monetary policies, the slowdown in China’s economic growth and the ongoing trade tension between the US and China also affected global economy and thus the nation’s economy,” he told the Dewan Rakyat here today.

Mohd Radzi was replying to a question from Datuk Dr Shamsul Anuar Nasarah (BN-Lenggong) who asked about Malaysia’s economic projection for the year and the ministry’s economic buffering mechanism to avoid an economic crisis.

He said according to Bank Negara Malaysia’s 2018 Annual Report, Malaysia’s economic growth for 2019 will be supported by domestic growth, especially the demand from the private sector which continues to be the nation’s main driver for economic growth.

Private consumption is expected to grow by 6.6 per cent while private investments are projected to rise by 4.9 per cent in 2019, he said.

At the same time, all of the nation’s main economic sectors are expected to record positive growth, with the service and manufacturing sectors projected to grow by 5.7 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively.

Both sectors remain as the largest contributors to the nation’s economy at around 79 per cent, Mohd Radzi said, adding that the Gross Domestic Product is expected to remain on a steady growth path, expanding between 4.3 per cent and 4.8 per cent this year. - Bernama"

She also said that TH has also not recorded any bank run since December last year.

“I am confident that TH now is under a team that is capable, high integrity and knows what are the best practises in Islamic finance.

“The worse is now over for TH. The problem was actually back in 2017, but people were not so worried as they were getting high hibah (dividends).

“Even though people get low hibah for 2018, they should know that everything is now back into Shariah- compliant,” Fuziah told reporters after delivering a keynote address at the one-day Malaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC) International Conference on Islamic Wealth Management and Financial Planning.

She also reiterated that the haj subsidy will only be awarded to first time pilgrims.

“The quota for the haj currently stands at 30,200 individuals and we will not give anymore special quota to ministers and those with ‘connections’, but to those who are really eligible and elderly, who are first timers,” said Fuziah, adding that the people should understand TH’s objectives.

She also said there is no limitation on the amount of saving by depositors in TH.

Last Friday, TH announced a hibah of 1.25 per cent for the financial year 2018, which amounted to a payout of RM913 million to its 9.3 million depositors.

Earlier in her speech, Fuziah said her ministry has proposed three main thrusts of good governance to ensure sustainability to move forward with the rapid changes of the current atmosphere.

The first thrust she said involved the establishment of Malaysian Model in various fields including economy and Islamic finance.

“This model will be the benchmark on how we can amalgamate Islamic principles in our administration by taking into consideration of our local culture, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society.

“In gearing up to achieve this objective, the second thrust is infusing the Maqasid Shariah, a practical approach to Islam is adopted in the current administrative approach. While the third thrust namely is Rahmatan Lil Alamin (Mercy to All Creation),” Fuziah added. - Bernama"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/new-nafta-deal-in-trouble-bruised-by-elections-tariff-rows/,"New US$1tril NAFTA deal 'in trouble', bruised by elections, tariff rows",Corporate News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",6:44 AM MYT,"MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA: More than six months after the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed a new deal to govern more than US$1 trillion in regional trade, the chances of the countries ratifying the pact this year are receding.

The three countries struck the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) on Sept. 30, ending a year of difficult negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded the preceding trade pact be renegotiated or scrapped.

But the deal has not ended trade tensions in North America. If ratification is delayed much longer, it could become hostage to electoral politics.

The United States has its next presidential contest in 2020, and Canada holds a federal election in October.

The delay means businesses are still uncertain about the framework that will govern future investments in the region.

""The USMCA is in trouble,"" said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America.

Though he believed the deal would ultimately be approved, Rozental said opposition from U.S. Democrats and unions to labor provisions in the deal, as well as bickering over tariffs, made its passage in the next few months highly unlikely.

Canada's Parliament must also ratify the treaty and officials say the timetable is very tight. Current legislators only have a few weeks work left before the start of the summer recess in June, and members of the new Parliament would have little chance to address ratification until 2020.

Trump, a Republican, has shown frustration with the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives for failing to sign off on the USMCA. He has threatened to pull out of the old pact, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), if Congress does not hurry up.

If Trump did dump NAFTA, the three nations would revert to trade rules in place before it came into effect in 1994.

TARIFFS

Canada and Mexico are seeking exemption from U.S. tariffs on global metal imports imposed last year.

The metals tariffs were not included in the USMCA and Mexico and Canada are impatient to resolve the issue. Mexico has repeatedly threatened to target new U.S. products by the end of April in retribution if tariffs are imposed.

Meanwhile, Trump on Thursday threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican auto exports unless Mexico does more to stop drug traffickers and illegal immigration.

Mexico's government is in the final stages of completing a new list of potential U.S. imports to be targeted, said Luz Maria de la Mora, a Mexican deputy economy minister.

""There's going to be a bit of everything,"" she told Reuters, declining to give details of how the list - originally encompassing products such as bourbon, cheese, motor boats, pork legs, steel and apples - could be modified.

De la Mora would not be drawn on whether Mexico could refuse to ratify USMCA if steel tariffs are not withdrawn, saying only: ""All options are on the table.""

In Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said this week her government was ""constantly"" looking at its own retaliation list, noting that Trump's tariffs left the country over C$16 billion worth of space to strike back.

Freeland did not say when that list could change, and a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it might not be necessary. Still, Freeland said Canada was coordinating with Mexico about its options.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who faces a tough re-election battle, on Thursday rejected accepting quotas on Canadian steel and aluminum in exchange for U.S. tariffs being dropped.

Trudeau was criticized during the USMCA negotiations for giving ground to Trump on access to Canada's dairy sector.

WORKERS

U.S. Democrats have threatened to block the USMCA unless Mexico passes legislation to improve workers' rights, a demand shared by the Canadian government.

A bill already in Mexico's Congress to strengthen trade unions should be approved this month, the government says.

Trump blamed NAFTA for millions of job losses in the United States as companies moved south to employ cheaper Mexican labor. Trump is running for re-election in 2020, and his 'America First' policy will likely feature prominently in the campaign.

Forcing Mexico and Canada to rework NAFTA was one of Trump's signature pledges during his shock win in 2016, and Democrats are pulling out the stops to avoid losing again.

""The closer the election gets, the harder it will be for Democrats to grant Trump a victory"" by ratifying the USMCA, said Sergio Alcocer, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister.

Some Democrats are pushing to change the deal - an idea that both Canadian and Mexican officials resist.

""People need to be very careful around opening up what could really be a Pandora's box,"" Freeland said on Thursday.

Canadian officials say they fear that if one part of the treaty were reopened, it could spark clamor for other sections to be renegotiated as well. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/how-flawed-software-and-excess-speed-doomed-an-ethiopian-airlines-737-max/,"How flawed software, excess speed doomed a Boeing 737 MAX",Airlines,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",6:51 AM MYT,"PARIS/SEATTLE/SINGAPORE: Minutes after take-off, the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX were caught in a bad situation.

A key sensor had been wrecked, possibly by hitting a foreign object, according to four aviation experts and two U.S. officials who were briefed on the flight data.

As soon as the pilots retracted the flaps and slats, according to flight data, the sensor began to feed faulty information into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), designed to prevent stalls.

Flying at full take-off power, according to the flight data, the crew then struggled with nose-down commands from MCAS, the four experts said. The high speed and the jet's forward-leaning posture made it nearly impossible to use the controls to pull the nose up.

Moments later, the Boeing Co jet hit the ground, killing all 157 people onboard after six minutes of flight.

A complicated picture of what happened in the cockpit of Flight 302 on March 10 is emerging from the sparse commentary of a preliminary report and a new data plot showing how crew and technology interacted.

Ethiopia's transport minister said on Thursday that the pilots followed all correct procedures in trying to keep the plane in the air.

""The preliminary report confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that the crew followed the right procedures,"" Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday. ""Under the circumstances, with a number of simultaneous warnings in the cockpit, the crew have performed professionally.""

The airline's youngest-ever but highly-experienced captain, a 29-year-old with a lengthy 8,122 hours flying time, and his 25-year-old co-pilot, with 361 hours, left the engines at full take-off power.

That would be an unusual step in a regular flight, according to four experts and five current and former pilots interviewed by Reuters, most of whom were not authorized to speak publicly.

""You would never, ever have full power for the whole flight,"" said Hart Langer, a veteran former senior vice president for flight operations at United Airlines.

The reason the pilots continued at full take-off power was not clear from the report. But it is not part of a usual procedure for dealing with the loss of key information such as the sensor data, the four experts said.

The Ethiopian Airlines statement suggested the crew left the throttles at takeoff power because they intended to continue to climb and were hampered by the nose-down commands of MCAS.

By the end, the aircraft was traveling at 500 knots (575 mph, 926 kph), far beyond Boeing's operating limits.

The Ethiopian Airlines statement said ""no excess speed was noted at the initial phases of the flight.""

The aircraft's speed and its nose-down angle when MCAS switched on for the last time may have left them unable to fight flawed Boeing software that eventually sent the jet into an uncontrollable dive, the four experts said after studying the data.

The Ethiopian Airlines crash, and another in Indonesia five months earlier, have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis as its top-selling jetliner is grounded worldwide, and Ethiopia scrambling to protect one of Africa's most successful companies.

All 737 MAX aircraft have been grounded and Boeing is working on an MCAS software fix and extra training that it says will prevent a repeat of such accidents.

Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday that both accidents were caused by a chain of events, ""with a common chain link being erroneous activation of the aircraft's MCAS function.""

BIRD STRIKE

Sources who reviewed the crash data said the problems started barely 12 seconds after take-off.

A sudden spike in black box data was consistent with a bird or other debris hitting the plane as it was taking off, shearing away a vital airflow sensor, said the four experts and two U.S. officials.

Ethiopian Airlines on Sunday called that scenario ""completely speculative"".

Ethiopian investigator Amdye Ayalew Fanta said a preliminary report released by Ethiopian investigators did not contain any indications of this.

Boeing said it would not comment on ongoing investigations.

As with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the damaged 'angle of attack' sensor, which measures how the wing is cutting through the air, may have set off a volatile chain of events.

In both cases, the faulty sensor tricked the plane's computer into thinking the aircraft was about to stall, or lose lift. The anti-stall MCAS software then pushed the nose down forcefully with the aircraft's ""trim"" system, normally used to maintain level flight.

The first time the MCAS software kicked in, flight data shows the Ethiopian Airlines pilots reacted quickly by flicking switches under their thumbs - they had recognized the movements as the same type flight crews had been warned about after the Lion Air crash. 

But data shows they were not able to fully counteract the computer's movements. At that point, they were a mere 3,000 feet above the airport, so low that a new warning - a computerized voice saying ""don't sink"" - sounded in the cabin.

When MCAS triggered again, the jetliner's trim was set to push the nose down at almost the maximum level, flight data shows, while the control yoke noisily vibrated with another stall warning called a ""stick shaker."" 

This time, the pilots countered MCAS more effectively, the experts said after studying the data. But when they turned off the system - as they were instructed to do by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the wake of the Lion Air disaster - the nose was still pointed downward, leaving the jetliner vulnerable.

The combination of their speed and a nose-down attitude meant up to 50 pounds of force would be needed to move the control column, the four experts and one of the pilots said, and moving the manual trim wheels was impossible.

'PULL UP, PULL UP'

The captain called out ""pull up"" three times, according to the cockpit voice recorder. The co-pilot reported problems to air traffic control.

In the meantime, the aircraft's speed remained abnormally high, the five pilots and four aviation experts said.

The sensor problems and loss of airflow data would have affected airspeed information too. In such cases, pilots are trained to turn off automatic engine settings and control thrust manually, according to a Boeing checklist, the pilots told Reuters.

Data confirms the engines stayed at nearly full power.

Still, several experienced pilots said there was an array of stressful factors sapping the pilots' attention.

""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high-workload environment,"" Muilenburg said Thursday. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk.""

Among the distractions was a ""clacker"" warning telling the pilots their aircraft was going too fast

As the nose gradually fell, the captain asked the co-pilot to try to trim the plane manually using a wheel in the center console to help the plane recover from the dive, according to the voice recorder.

But it was too hard to move the wheel. Both men then tried to pitch the nose up together. The captain, according to the report, said it was not enough.

MCAS RE-ACTIVATES

Data shows the MCAS-related systems were switched back on. That would also reactivate the electric trim system, making it easier to force the reluctant nose higher, the experts said.

Reactivating MCAS is contrary to advice issued by Boeing and the FAA after Lion Air. The report did not address that. The airline did not comment.

The pilots managed to lift the nose slightly using the electric thumb switches on their control yokes. But the data readout shows they flicked those switches only briefly.

With its power restored, a final MCAS command kicked in, eventually pushing the nose down to a 40 degree angle at 500 knots, far beyond the plane's safe operating speed, defined by Boeing as 340 knots.

As the 737 MAX plunged, G-forces turned negative, pulling occupants out of their seats.

Just six minutes after take off, the plane crashed into a field. - Reuters"

The meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, last month demonstrated how Malaysian brands and advertisers are punching above their weight with the appointment of another chief marketing officer (CMO) to the WFA’s executive committee.
CIMB Group  CMO Adam Mohamed Wee Abdullah joins Tune Group	   head of marketing and media  Margaret Au-Yong as part of the leadership group for an organisation that represents 90% of the world’s ad spend. 
The Lisbon conference brings together more than 800 industry leaders, of which 80% are brand owners.
The Malaysian delegation was led by the Malaysian Advertisers Association (MAA) president Mohamed Kadri Mohamed Taib. Also present at the WFA’s AGM  were senior representatives from the MAA. 
The power of Malaysia’s marketing voice has also played a part in persuading the WFA to hold next year’s Global Marketer Week in Singapore. 
The decision to return to South-East Asia after the 2016 event, which was successfully hosted by MAA in Kuala Lumpur, reflects both the importance of Asia Pacific as a region and the increasingly high-profile of South-East Asia as a source of growth for many of the multinational brands that make up the WFA’s membership.
Commenting on Malaysia’s voice in the federation, WFA CEO Stephan Loerke said: “Malaysia has become a vital voice in the WFA, offering counsel and understanding of an increasingly important market for our members. We’re thrilled to have so many of those voices on our executive committee and corporate members such as AirAsia  and CIMB.” The World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) is the voice of marketers worldwide, representing 90% of the global marketing communications spend – about  US$900bil per annum.
Meanwhile,  WFA has called on all brands globally to hold social media platforms to account, in light of recent failures to block dangerous and hateful content. 
While companies must decide their own approaches, WFA is calling on its members and brands worldwide in their capacity as the funders of the online advertising system to put pressure on platforms to do more to prevent their services and algorithms from being hijacked by those with malicious intent.
The call comes after the recent multiple incidents on some of the world’s biggest digital platforms, including paedophile comments being left in comments below videos of children on YouTube, the glorification of self-harm and suicide content on Instagram and, most recently, the live-streaming of the terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand on Facebook.
All these platforms are funded by advertisers and as such those that make them profitable have a moral responsibility to consider more than just the effectiveness and efficiency they provide for brand messages.
WFA noted that it was standing alongside its member association and colleagues at the Association of New Zealand Advertisers (Anza), which has issued a call asking for members to think carefully about where they place advertising and challenging platform owners to do more.
Loerke stressed that marketers must reflect on the extent and terms on which they fund these platforms. “Conversely, the platforms must do more to assuage the growing number of advertiser concerns. 
“WFA is committed to working with the platforms in a constructive manner to find solutions to these grave problems. Our shared goal must be to build an ecosystem that is sustainable and doesn’t undermine people, communities and society at large,”  he added. 
Making a firm stand,  Anza chief executive Lindsay Mouat said: “This is not an issue of brand safety, this is a moral question to hold social media platforms to account – in the same way we do for traditional media.” 
Improving the online ecosystem is a top priority for WFA members. About 47% of respondents to a WFA member barometer conducted last month of more than 200 senior marketers from over 100 brands representing US$125bil in ad spend cited improving the online advertising ecosystem as the single biggest issue the marketing industry needed to address this year.
On another note, a WFA research highlighted that marketers would have to work more closely with in-house policy teams not only to help brands avoid regulatory scrutiny but also to meet society’s rising expectations. 
Nine out of 10 marketers agree that it is increasingly important to have input from the policy team in order to meet society’s changing brand expectations and demands for companies to help solve the world’s many challenges.
New research from WFA with input from global PR firm Edelman highlights the demand on both sides for greater interaction, with 87% of policy experts and 68% of marketers wanting to see greater collaboration.
Today’s reality, however, is that 65% of policy executives said they felt there was too little interaction between the two teams, a view supported by 43% of marketers.
Most marketers see the value that policy teams bring in avoiding regulatory challenges, with 65% of marketers able to think of a time when the policy team helped avoid regulatory scrutiny.
The findings are based on responses from 97 marketers and policy experts representing 50 WFA member companies and a collective advertising spend of more than US$60bil."

Matrade deputy director Md Zainuddin A. Jalil shared that local exporters should market their products and services in China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Egypt, Russia, Japan and Germany.
Zainuddin who gave a presentation on Going Global with Matrade at the recent Export Excellence Awards 2019 roadshow in Penang, said Malaysia’s total trade amounted RM1.876tril in 2018, from RM9.45bil in the 1970s.
He said that China, Singapore, US, Japan and Thailand were Malaysia’s major trading partners last year, making up more than half the country’s combined trade.
At the Export Excellence Awards 2019 roadshow, Zainuddin shared with participants that the country’s five major export and import products are electrical and electronic products; petroleum products; chemicals and chemical products; palm oil agriculture, machinery and equipment; and, metal manufactures.



He urged exporters to register free with Matrade so that they could access information on how to export their products and services effectively and efficiently. They can also receive the latest alerts on opportunities in foreign markets.
“They just need to download the Matrade mobile app to get the updates on market opportunities, new regulations or barriers imposed by the particular country, on tender, on limitation on import for certain items, and other inputs which are easily accessible to our members,” he said, adding that Matrade has 34 trade offices and 12 marketing offices abroad.
“Make use of our Business Information Centre library at our headquarters for business directories, country profiles, tariff schedules, market reports, periodicals and statistics,” he said.
Zainuddin told participants they could apply online for market development grants from Matrade, whereby exporters who visit international trade fairs could claim 50% of their costs (which covers rental of booth, economy flight ticket and accommodation for one person) – up to RM15,000 for one session, and a maximum RM200,000 per company.
He shared that Matrade conducts trade fairs where local participants could engage in direct negotiation and dealings with international buyers without having to travel abroad, as well as international sourcing programme and export acceleration missions.
For the export acceleration missions, the participants would be limited to 15 companies, and the focus would be on two or three sectors per trip, adding that the sectors this year are construction and building materials, medical, automotive, machinery, aerospace, maritime, oil and gas, and, chemicals and chemical products.
Star Media Group in partnership with Standard Chartered launched the inaugural Export Excellence Awards 2019, with PKT Logistics as co-sponsor and Matrade as patron. 
The seven main award categories are electrical and electronics; oil and gas; chemical, mineral and alloy; agriculture; machinery, equipment and automation; services; and, other industries. 
Three companies will receive the Exporter of the Year title, while a special award will be given for the halal products category.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/debt-market-dampener/,Debt market dampener,Corporate News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Bond issuers in the non-financial space could come under further pressure this year due to weaker economic prospects and external headwinds.
These issuers could face the possibility of their debt ratings being lowered by rating agencies, hence placing them on negative outlook in the agencies’ portfolios.
A positive rating outlook means that a rating may be raised while a negative outlook reflects the possibility of the rating lowered. A stable outlook denotes situations where the rating is expected to remain unchanged over the intermediate term. 
A rating outlook generally covers a six to 24-month time horizon.
Bank Negara is projecting Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) to expand between 4.3% and 4.8% this year - a slightly more cautious forecast compared with the 4.9% GDP growth estimated by the Finance Ministry during the tabling of the 2019 Budget last November. In 2018, Malaysia’s GDP grew by 4.7%.
RAM Ratings head of data analytics Julie Ng told StarBiz the rating agency has placed a negative outlook for the automotive, media, oil and gas support services, commercial property and construction sectors. 
“These sectors are facing the mounting pressures stemming from a slower economy, declining prices and poor industry prospects,” she added.

PHOON: We expect broad credit conditions to remain supported on the back of still stable macro settings.
As at end-2018, there were 14 issuers with a negative outlook in RAM’s portfolio, of which many of them were from the above sectors.  
While the majority of the issuers on negative outlook had already transitioned to lower ratings in the preceding quarters, she said their outlook remained negative as industry challenges had not sufficiently abated to warrant a revision ie back to stable outlook. 
Ng, however, said she does not expect rating downgrades to further rise this year, adding that  a change in rating outlook typically, although not always, precedes a change in rating in the subsequent 12-18 months. 
In 2018, there were more downgrades than upgrades due to the more challenging economic conditions. 
The downgrade to upgrade ratio was 2.25 in 2018 (2017: 2.00). 
Issuers with a positive outlook could eventually see a rating upgrade in upcoming reviews, she noted.
These positive outlook involved companies in the plantation and power sectors, which exhibited sturdier credit metrics as a result of improved sales and cost savings, Ng said.
A rating downgrade is when a rating agency lowers a bond’s rating as opposed to an upgrade when a rating is raised. 
Meanwhile, Maybank Kim Eng  head of fixed income research Winson Phoon noted that within the rated universe, there has been negative-biased credit trends in the past few years, with “ratings downgrades and negative outlook ratings “ outnumbering “ratings upgrades and positive outlook ratings”, partly due to sector-specific weaknesses such as the media and toll-road sectors. 
He thinks this trend would continue in 2019.
Phoon said he does not expect broad-based bond issuer downgrades this year as there was no sign of stress in domestic bond markets as credit spreads have tightened in the past few months because of positive supply-demand profile (ie demand exceeds supply). “We expect broad credit conditions to remain supported, on the back of still stable macro settings,” he said.   
Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd (MARC) in its latest 2018 Annual Corporate Default and Rating Transitions Study noted that  the overall weaker performances of Malaysian corporates would likely exert pressure on the rating trajectories of MARC-rated non-financial corporates. 
In particular, the rating agency expects corporates in the property, construction and palm oil sectors to be more vulnerable to headwinds. 
On balance, it however noted, there is generally enough headroom within the rating bands to allow performance stress to be absorbed without necessitating severe rating changes. It foresees more challenges for Malaysian non-financial corporates in 2019 due to weaker economic prospects on both the domestic and external fronts. 
As for yield projection for this year amid a Dovish stance by the US Federal Reserve (Fed),  Phoon said he forecasts the 10y MGS yield to reach 3.90% by end-June and 4.00% by end-December 2019.
As to whether the dovish stance by the Fed would impact government and corporate bonds? 
He noted: “The Fed’s dovish pivot is causing the US Treasuries (UST) curve to gravitate lower. 
“This has encouraged yield-seeking flows to other regional bond markets and indirectly benefited local bonds.” 
On the impact of the current inverted US treasury yield curve on the Malaysian Government securities (MGS) and overall bond market, Phoon said it depends on the time horizon. 
In the near term, he said the focus would be more on lower yields in the developed markets and the anchoring effect on other regions.  But if one were to take a medium to longer term view, he said the fact that the UST yield curve inversion signals a recession risk in the US, then it should not be under-estimated. Ng views the  inverted US treasury curve as a dampener to foreign investor demand for domestic bonds even as the Fed and other major central banks pull back on liquidity tightening efforts."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/is-the-fed-boxed-in-on-providing-stimulus/,Is the Fed boxed in on providing stimulus?,Economy,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"Has the Federal Reserve painted itself into a corner by always having to prop up failing markets, especially through a flood of stimulus money called quantitative easing (QE)? 
After ten years of inundating the markets via US$4.5 trillion of bond purchases, the Fed is again called to prop up weakening growth through provision of such liquidity and rate cuts.
The pressure is growing. US President Donald Trump had last Friday, an hour after the release of strong jobs numbers and wage growth, called on the Fed to turn the economy into a “rocket ship,” restart QE and cut rates.
The rebound in US non-farm payrolls by 196,000 jobs was in sharp contrast to meagre gains of a revised 33,000 jobs in February.
US jobs growth in 2019 is below the brisk pace in 2018.
Earlier, Trump had attacked the Fed for raising rates and carrying out the “ridiculously timed quantitative tightening (QT).”
US National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow had wanted a stop to this QT, where the Fed had started withdrawing its bond purchases and shrunk its portfolio to still a sizeable US$3.8 trillion.
Along with its abrupt change from two to zero rate hikes this year, the Fed had planned to stop its QT by September which is just five months away.
But it looks like the forces cannot wait.
“I think we are set for QE forever; the Fed is boxed in. Long before the recession arrives, the Fed will likely cut rates and when the recession sets in , they will quickly engage in the next QE programme,’’ said Pong Teng Siew, the head of research of Inter-Pacific Securities.
This switch from QE to QT, and then potentially back to QE, is likened to a process of “rinse, wash and repeat,” where a perpetual motion machine allows other machines to operate without any energy inputs.
This seems to be the way where markets may be set up to run practically non-stop for a long time.
In scolding the Fed over rate hikes and QT, Trump had said the stockmarket would have ‘been much higher and world markets would be in a better place,’ if not for those Fed actions.
Trade war was not mentioned.
Post the 2008 financial crisis, a huge stimulus was required to revive the US economy; stoking asset prices was one such way.
That, however, created a huge stockmarket bubble where price earnings ratios of 100 times became acceptable even ten years later.
Many shudder at what it would be like once the bubble bursts.
The potentially devastating effects of such a big fall, against reduced liquidity and softening growth, would be undesirable; the Fed would have to maintain or pump in liquidity to keep the markets bubbling on.
It looks like the Fed believes in the role of asset markets to keep business and consumer confidence strong.
The wealth effect generated will lead to stronger consumer spending, a bulwark of the US economy.
A very slow normalisation process by the Fed, which had kept monetary policy highly accommodative well into the post-financial crisis expansion, has continued to fuel market froth.
“The fact that according to former Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, monetary policy is far too blunt an instrument to prevent asset bubbles, does not help,’’ noted Nor Zahidi Alias, chief economist, Malaysian Rating Corp.
QE may be more sought after as the Fed clearly lacks the room for major rate cuts unlike previously, when rates were slashed by four to five percentage points.
The Fed has dragged its feet in unwinding monetary stimulus from the last recession, and this has significantly weakened its ability to combat another recession anytime soon, said Anthony Dass, head of AmBank Research.
Kudlow had asked for an immediate cut of half a percentage point in rates. Two Trump nominees to the Fed board, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, also back lower rates with Moore calling for rate cuts.
The Fed’s moves on QE and interest rates, are part of its monetary stance to keep growth steady while maintaining price stability.
The Fed can always recalibrate this when the economy no longer needs a supportive and accommodative policy, said Lee Heng Guie, the executive director of Socio Economic Research Center.
Such assessments may be difficult. Estimating the lags of monetary policy that had, since last year, entailed four rate hikes and some QT, requires a thorough understanding of the many ways through which monetary policy impacts the economy.
Insufficient knowledge of these channels leads to overshooting in the easing or tightening of monetary policy.
Investors should be aware of the perils of prolonging the period of asset bubbles.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/investment-banking-to-pick-up-steam/,Investment banking to pick up steam,Banking,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: After a generally tepid year in 2018, there’s been improvement in the investment banking (IB) scene so far, but caution continues to prevail among investors.
Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) CEO  Fad’l Mohamed said this adding that the bank, the largest in the country, had already seen a healthier pipeline of deals in the first three months of this year, compared to the year earlier. 
“In 2018,  we saw a lot of adjustments, people were looking for clarity, this year  we are seeing a lot of value come out.
“In terms of deal pipeline, it will be  far better  but having said that, investors still  remain cautious so they will be very careful before taking  a position,” he told Starbiz in an interview.
To be sure, it was a relatively listless IPO market last year.
Although there were 22 listings in total,  capital raised on Bursa Malaysia during the year was only RM709mil, of which two were Main Market issuances.
This value was even less than the RM1bil raised in 2016, which at that time - based on that amount - was already seen as a collapse, no thanks to a soft overall global market.
In 2017, things had improved and total capital raised via IPOs stood at RM7.4bil from  13 listings of which among the larger ones were Eco World  International Bhd and Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd.
This year, among the more sizeable IPOs that are expected to take place are that of QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, the operator of the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Pizza Hut outlets countrywide, and poultry producer Leong Hup International. 
Notably, both are re-listings, having gone public before they were taken private more than five years ago. 
Fad’l noted that within the domestic market, companies were “bulking up” this year, starting to look at optimising their balance sheets and positioning themselves to either acquire assets or be more focused on their areas of strength.
In the merger and acquisition (M&A) space, Fad’l said he expects a potentially “more vibrant” market, citing opportunities which could come from certain government-linked  investment companies which have indicated that they would undergo corporate exercises.
Within the debt market used to finance mega infrastructure projects, he said he expected the segment to register levels “not very far” from last year which saw total issuance coming in at RM109bil. 
Of this, government-guaranteed  papers made up 29%.
“Although a lot of infrastructure projects have been deferred, at the end of the day there are still a lot of ongoing jobs such as the MRT and the water-related projects - whatever that needs to be done is still being done.”
He admits that the cancellation and deferment of a few key infrastructure projects has “in a way” impacted the investment bank.
“But I think the market remains vibrant and there is still a lot of demand for debt-raising,”
Recall, some of the cancelled or deferred projects include the The East Coast Rail Link or ECRL, the  MRT Circle line (Line 3), the Trans Sabah Gas Pipeline, the KL-Singapore High Speed Rail and the Sistem Kawalan Imigresen Nasional (SKIN). 
All these were postponed or axed post GE14,  due largely to costs issues.
Meanwhile, Maybank Kim Eng Group CEO Ami Moris taking on a bigger-picture view, said she believes that the Malaysian economy is in “good stead.”
“The key word to describe it is resilient. Resilient meaning it is very well diversified and there isn’t any one particular sector that really dominates in terms of the sectoral composition of Bursa as a whole marketplace,”  she said.
She pointed out the growing significance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that according to her,  are perhaps not well captured within the universe of public markets.
“The activity within the SMEs, where there is a lot more focus on new and innovative segments of the economy - I think that’s what we need to be excited about.
“Additionally,  some of these companies  have actually outgrown the definition of SMEs and now form about 50% of the Malaysian economy, she added.
“That is fairly astounding.”
Ami also said that execution remained something that people were watching and tracking.
“But as what (Finance Minister) Lim Guan Eng said, Malaysia (its fiscal position)  will be put back on track within three years.
“It’s a three-year thing so it will be fairly hasty to judge on a  monthly or  yearly basis... he has said very clearly that the Government has set the milestone within a 3-year period, I think that’s highly realistic.” 
Lim had also said last month at the Invest Malaysia conference that the country will return to its “Asian tiger” status in three years.
In February, he said the country’s debt was still at the trillion ringgit level as at the end of 2018."

A feasibility study on the BICT’s expansion is currently under way and the plan will involve infrastructure development and procuring container handling equipment.
The BICT handled 349,792 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit) last year, representing 13.1% growth over 2017 and the the highest ever volume, according to BPHB group chief executive officer Datuk Mohammad Medan Abdullah.
“We have seen three consecutive years of double digit growth to date. Our growth rate in container volume surpassed the national container throughput average of 3.7% growth annually.
“In terms of capacity, the BICT is currently operating at 78% capacity with the utilisation expected to improve further in 2019 in line with expected increase in container volume,” he added.
Short-term measures to improve operational efficiencies and service delivery on container sector include tackling specific bottleneck at the container yard, berth window management and allocating the general cargo wharf into container feedering operation.
Reviewing BPHB’s yearly performance, Mohammad said the strong growth had strengthened BICT as the No. 1 container port in Sarawak and Sabah in terms of container throughput and connectivity.
“The impressive throughput was driven by increased import and export due to active economic development in Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE), particularly the Samalaju Industrial Park (SIP),increasing trend towards containerisation of cargo and more transhipment volumes from Sabah and Sarawak.
“Of the total containerised cargo handled at BICT, 23.7% (82,930 TEUs) were transhipment cargoes,” he said in the company’s 2018 annual report.
As part of the on-going efforts to enhance service and operational delivery,BICT has deployed additional yard equipment and resources to support the container yard’s operations.
2018 saw BICT attracting more shipping connectivity to Intra-Asia ports with the introduction of the new container shipping routes by SITC Container Lines (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.
BICT is now directly connected to Indonesian ports such as Makassar, Balikpapan and Semarang as well as more ports in China, such as Shanghai,Xiamen and Shokou.
At present, BICT is connected to regional and global container trade lanes through nine major shipping lines. Three of the shipping lines – Evergreen Marine Corp (M) Sdn Bhd, SITC Container Lines and Harbour-Link Line Sdn Bhd – offer direct shipping services to the Intra-Asia ports, thus boosting BICT’s connectivity offering to customers.
Mohammad said Bintulu Port’s dry bulk cargo sector also registered an impressive 8.3% growth in cargo throughput to 6.86 million tonnes in 2018 over 2017 due to higher raw materials’ imports (like aluminium oxide, silica quartz, manganese ore, semi coke and iron ore) generated from energy-intensive industries in Samalaju Industrial Park as their plants ramped up production to meet increased demand from customers.
The export of woodchips via Bintulu Port jumped by nearly 190% to 388,759 tonnes from 134,729 tonnes year-on-year due to higher demand from Japan and Indonesia.
Bintulu Port also recorded higher palm oil throughput of 4.32 million tonnes (+2.3%) and break bulk cargo of 1.77 million tonnes (+5.3%) during the year under review.
There was higher export volume of palm oil products to China, India, Pakistan and US.and Bintulu Port handled some 95% of Sarawak’s total production.Bintulu Port is also the largest palm oil products’ exporting terminal in Malaysia, handling about 26.2% of the country’s total export.
On liquified natural gas (LNG), Mohammad said LNG cargo delcined to 23.68 million tonnes in 2018 from 27.14 million tonnes in 2017 due mainly to gas supply disruption experienced throughout the year.
“The LNG export market for cargoes from Bintulu Port saw China emerging as a prominent buyer behind Japan, indicating the rise of China as a major global LNG market.
“To capitalise on this,the group has been actively pursuing opportunities in terms of new ways of handling,transportation and export of LNG via ISO tank containers,” he added."

Jet, India’s oldest private carrier, is saddled with more than US$1bil in debt, compounding its financial woes and forcing it to ground most of its fleet.
After Jet failed to convince potential investors, including its largest shareholder Etihad Airways, to bail it out, Indian banks decided to take a majority stake in the carrier.
Last month, Jet’s lenders, led by State Bank of India agreed to bail out the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a majority stake, while seeking out an investor to help revive the company’s fortunes.
Jet’s lenders on Thursday said they planned to seek expressions of interest in the airline from potential investors from April 6 and that all submissions from interested parties are expected to be completed by April 9.
But this process may be delayed as the Reserve Bank of India is yet to examine the issue of debt to equity conversion, the paper said, citing a source.
In February, Jet said its shareholders had approved a plan to convert its existing debt to equity. — Reuters"

Group chief executive officer Jeffrey Goh(pic) said the US$20mil plant in Singapore was being equipped with machinery.
“The plant, which produces engine casing for Airbus and Boeing, should be fully equipped by year-end and be fully operational in 2020,” he said.
The nacelle beam production plant in the RM140mil Bukit Minyak plant is equipped with state-of-the-art precision machinery and will employ 200 highly-skilled workers when fully ramped up.
“We currently have an order book of RM3.1bil. The ramp up is to fulfil partially the orders in the book,” he said. 
Goh said the short-term market outlook remains positive for the group’s aerospace business, which generates about 60% of its revenue.
“We continue to deliver parts that are used in Boeing B737 and B787 aircraft where demand is stable, and we are ramping production on parts used in the new Airbus A320neo.
“For our parts that are used in business jet applications, demand continues to be volatile as compared with the commercial airliner market,” he said.
On the recent controversy over the Boeing 737max, Goh said the group supplies engine casing to the aircraft.
“We are still producing parts for the model. There are no stop work instructions,” Goh added.
On the cancellation of Airbus 380 by Airbus, Goh said the impact on SAMEE is minimal.
In Penang, SAMEE has five plants in Bayan Lepas on the island, of which two are involved in the production of aerospace components.
In Seberang Prai, it has one plant producing nacelle beams.
The group also has two plants in Singapore and a plant in Thailand.
On the 2019 financial year that just ended March 31, Goh said the group expected the revenue from the aerospace industry which accounts for about 60% of our group revenue to remain stable.
“We expect the revenue from the equipment business to decrease marginally in the fourth quarter due to softer demand from the customers from semiconductor and HDD industry. “However, we expect the demand from the hard disk drive storage segment to recover next financial year,” he said.
Meanwhile, Airbus’ president for Asia Pacific Jean-Marc Nasr said recently in a media briefing in March that Airbus expected to increase its local sourcing activities and partnerships to US$550mil (RM2.24bil) by 2023, up 38.3% from US$400mil (RM1.62bil) in 2018.
“We are 100% committed to growing our presence in Malaysia and we believe that the country’s aerospace industry has the potential to become one of the largest in the region,” he added.
The growth would be due to higher passenger traffic growth in the region, translating into higher demand for air traffic production and maintenance, repair and overhaul services, according to Nasr.
Currently, he said the company is the biggest partner for Malaysia’s aerospace industry, while Malaysia is Airbus’ third largest market in the Asia-Pacific region after China and India.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/ecrl-deal-with-china-to-include-palm-oil-buy/,ECRL deal with China to include palm oil buy,Corporate News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: The current re-negotiations on the East Coast Rail Link  (ECRL) may see its construction price pegged at RM50mil to RM60mil per km as well as a commitment by the Chinese government to buy Malaysian palm oil and bring in projects, according to sources.
This means that the construction of the 688-km long ECRL, suspended last July after the new government found irregularities in the terms of the “lopsided” contract, would cost between RM34.4bil and RM41.3bil.
According to a source with technical know-how, China and Malaysia have agreed to this pricing: Constructing a rail track on normal terrain is about RM50mil per km; and for tunnelling at the Main Range and areas with challenging soil condition, the cost can be raised up to RM60mil per km.
Last Friday, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng hinted that the ECRL could cost RM36bil, down from about RM55bil announced in 2016 by the previous administration and RM81bil estimated by the present government.
The Malaysian team negotiating with China is led by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s special envoy Tun Daim Zainuddin, who has indicated the ECRL deal would be finalised this month.
Daim, also Malaysia’s former finance minister, told reporters last month: “We are almost there. Just need to tighten the screws here and there.”
One source close to the Malaysian negotiating team tells StarBiz that for the price to be lower, the ECRL will adopt single-tracking and not double-tracking, as the passenger and freight traffic flow is expected to be low due to sparse population and low investments in the states of Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan.
A single-track railway is a railway where trains travelling in both directions share the same track. A double-track railway involves running one track in each direction. The cheaper single track is for lesser-used lines.
“The Chinese really wants to see the ECRL coming into fruition, as this is a key project under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative. Their attitude has been very accommodating in the negotiations, though initially they were tough,” said the source from the Malaysian side.
The ECRL is of strategic importance to China because by using the Kuantan Port-ECRL-Port Klang route, its trading route and time to the west of Peninsular Malaysia could be cut short and there is no need to use Singapore Port.
The project will also benefit Malaysia as it will spur tourism and economic growth in the East Coast states. 
Touted as a game changer for Malaysia, the ECRL is expected to reduce travel time from Gombak (in Selangor) to Kota Baru (in Kelantan) to under four hours, from 8-12 hours at present.
But the price tag of RM81bil would be too much of a burden for Malaysia due to the heavy debts of the government.
However, if Malaysia were to cancel the ECRL project unilaterally, it would have to pay about RM20bil in compensation to China.
According to the sources, the ECRL package under negotiation will include a commitment from China to purchase more local palm oil and to direct more Chinese investments into Malaysia.
“This is under bilateral talks now. We are talking about a package, not just the ECRL project. Top officials from the Primary Industries Ministry have joined the negotiation team,” says the source.
In fact, Daim had already hinted earlier on the inclusion of the commercial elements.
In an interview on TV3’s prime-time Bulletin Utama three weeks ago, Daim said the ECRL would have “new commercial elements that would have a greater impact on Malaysian companies and people”.
He said: “When we discuss, we negotiate and I like to make a commercial deal... a lot more (projects) will come our way and we will get more profit.”
Daim also said he had been in touch with the relevant parties in China and “both countries have reached a decision to finalise the agreement”.
But it is not immediately known how much palm oil China will commit to buy and the duration of the commitment.
President Xi made a pledge to former prime mnister Datuk Seri Najib Razak that Beijing would buy Malaysia’s palm oil “without upper limit” during the latter’s official visit to China in 2016, when bilateral ties were very close.
But since last year, China has slowed down its purchase of local palm oil and raised its offtake from Indonesia. Many see this as a response to the suspension of several China projects in Malaysia and attacks on Chinese investments by some key politicians. 
The ECRL package will include China’s commitment to bring in investments in the manufacturing and high-tech industries needed for economic digitisation, says another source.
Last Friday, Lim hinted that the ECRL could include the state of Negri Sembilan, if negotiations with the Chinese government were successful, and the project was to go on."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/aramco-set-for-mega-debt-deal-pitched-by-jpmorgans-dimon/,Aramco set for mega debt deal pitched by JPMorgan’s Dimon,Oil & Gas,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"NEW YORK: In a bond sale closely watched by investors globally, Saudi Aramco and its bankers are preparing to kick off what could be at least a US$10bil offering next week. Early indications suggest investors are already crowding in.
A message circulated among investors on Friday said interest in the most highly anticipated sale of the year already totalled more than US$26bil, according to sources. The state-owned oil giant and bankers spent the last week drumming up support for its debut offering at presentations in cities ranging from New York and Chicago to Singapore and Tokyo.
The success of the sale is hugely important for banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, that are working on the company’s behalf. They are eager to run an initial public offering by Aramco -- the world’s most profitable company -- if and when it comes, which would bring lucrative fees for the selected banks. In a rare appearance that underlines the bond sale’s significance, JPMorgan’s chief executive officer Jamie Dimon spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to a source.
Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc and NCB Capital Co are also managing the bond sale, according to a prospectus seen by Bloomberg News. The initial price talk on the bond may be announced today, with pricing as early as Tuesday, the people said. Representatives of the company declined to comment on the sale process.
“It will be definitely a jumbo deal with at least four tranches,” said Sergey Dergachev senior portfolio manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt. “Demand should be huge.” He speculated that demand could even surpass the record US$53bil in bids that Qatar received for its US$12bil bond sale last year.
Aramco is turning to the dollar bond market as the company is starting to raise cash ahead of the purchase of a US$69bil majority stake in domestic petrochemical giant Sabic. The bond sale represents an alternate way for Saudi Arabia to raise money and diversify from oil after an IPO of Aramco was postponed last year. Saudi Arabia has valued Aramco at a whopping US$2 trillion, though not all investors are convinced it’s worth that much.
The bond sale will extend the already record start for issuers from the Gulf Cooperation Council – exceeding US$30bil so far this year. It caps four consecutive years of bond sales from the kingdom, most recently pricing US$7.5bil in international bonds in January, only months since the brutal killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
While demand for the bonds is likely to be high, investors remain torn on whether that interest will allow Aramco to pay yields lower than what its owner, the Saudi Arabia government, does. On the one hand, Aramco is immensely profitable and produces endless cash flow. In addition, investors who manage high-grade corporate debt are showing interest in buying the Aramco bonds. All of that could bring the borrowing cost lower than that of the government, according to Nikolay Menteshashvili, an analyst with Insight Investment in London.
But others see it differently. They say Aramco is inextricably linked to the Saudi government, which is subject to a variety of risks including low oil prices. That’s why Jim Barrineau, head of emerging-market debt at Schroders Plc, said he wouldn’t be interested in buying Aramco’s bonds at a rate lower than the government’s. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/top-us-court-rebuffs-challenge-to-nike-over-michael-jordan-photo/,Top US court rebuffs challenge to Nike over Michael Jordan photo,Corporate News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",7:00 AM MYT,"WASHINGTON: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider reviving a copyright case in which Nike Inc was accused of unauthorized use of photographer Jacobus Rentmeester's famous 1984 photograph of basketball superstar Michael Jordan soaring through the air.

The justices turned away an appeal by Rentmeester, a former Life Magazine photographer, of a lower court's ruling throwing out his copyright infringement lawsuit against the sportswear company. Rentmeester had said the decision against him by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could stifle creativity and reward piracy.

Rentmeester, a former Olympic rower, photographed Jordan on a grassy knoll at the University of North Carolina for a Life edition on American athletes bound to compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Jordan appears in a sort of gravity-defying leap, inspired by the grand-jeté pose in ballet, his left hand holding a basketball aloft. Rentmeester thought to capture Jordan that way after photographing Mikhail Baryshnikov at the American Ballet Theatre a year earlier, according to court papers.

Rentmeester accused Nike of commissioning a version of his photo for its commercial benefit, infringing his copyright.

Nike's version shows Jordan in a similar pose against the backdrop of Chicago's skyline after he joined the NBA's Chicago Bulls. Nike used the photo on posters and billboards promoting its lucrative Air Jordan brand.

Rentmeester's 2015 lawsuit also accused Nike of infringing his copyright by creating its silhouetted ""Jumpman"" logo, which has become one of its most recognizable trademarks, accounting for billions of dollars in sales.

The 9th Circuit, in dismissing the case last year, ruled that the pose, as well as other elements of the photograph, could not be copyrighted and that Rentmeester did not show that the photo's details were ""substantially similar.""

Urging the Supreme Court to review that decision, Rentmeester's attorneys said the image is not a cliche shot of a basketball player. Its ""expressive elements were meticulously created by Rentmeester, and then meticulously pirated by Nike,"" they said in a written brief.

Nike has said that ideas, such as capturing Jordan in a leaping pose, cannot be copyrighted.

Jordan, 56, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, is principal owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and is worth $1.9 billion, according to Forbes magazine. - Reuters"

Lynas, the world's only major producer of rare earths outside China, has been locked in a dispute with the South East Asian nation, which has told it to remove years of accumulated waste as a condition of renewing its licence in September.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday that companies interested in acquiring Lynas had pledged to remove low-level radioactivity before shipping raw materials to the country.

Mahathir did not specify which companies were interested in Lynas. The company last month rejected a $1.1 billion takeover approach by Australian retail-to-chemicals conglomerate Wesfarmers.

Lynas said on Monday that for some months it has been developing detailed plans that would assist the company to mitigate risk from any regulatory changes in Malaysia.

""We see value in operating alternative cracking and leaching processing close to our resource,"" it said in a statement,

Lynas mines rare earths at Mount Weld in Western Australia and currently ships the concentrated material to an $800 million processing plant in Kuantan, Malaysia, where it stores thousands of tonnes of waste.

Initial ore processing in Australia to lower levels of radioactivity would mean building a cracking and leaching plant at a cost of about A$100 million over three years, according to a research report by brokerage CLSA.

Mahathir said even Lynas could operate in the country as long as raw materials coming to Malaysia were cleaned.

""A partial resolution to the political uncertainty has been reached which will bring forward plans to build a cracking plant in Australia,"" CLSA said.

Wesfarmers said that it welcomed comments by the Malaysian government.

""It is consistent with prior public statements by the government and the views shared with us in meetings with senior Malaysian government officials since we announced our proposal to acquire Lynas,"" it said in a statement.

""We look forward to more detail from the government about Lynas' operating licence certainty, to assess the conditionality of our proposal.""

Lynas said its Japanese lenders and customers had pledged their support for the company and its management. It was seeking further clarification from the Malaysian government.

In December, Malaysia's Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) told Lynas that it must export stockpiles of a type of residue from its processing plant by Sept. 2, when its full operating stage licence is due for renewal.

In February, Lynas said that exporting the residue within the mandated timeline was ""unachievable"". - Reuters

Chinese reserves, the world's largest, rose by nearly $9 billion in March to $3.099 trillion, its highest since August last year, central bank data showed on Sunday.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would rise $5 billion to $3.095 trillion.

""The U.S. dollar index strengthened slightly in March due to China-U.S. trade talks, the revised policy outlooks of central banks in Europe and America as well as uncertainty over Brexit...China's forex reserves expanded marginally,"" China's forex regulator said after the data release.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) added that with the economy expected to maintain reasonable growth and improved flexibility in the yuan exchange rate, the country's forex reserves will remain stable.

The yuan fell 5.3 percent against the dollar last year as trade relations with the United States deteriorated and the Chinese economy slowed. But it has rebounded over 2 percent so far in 2019 on hopes Washington and Beijing will reach an agreement to end their bruising trade war

In March, the yuan fell 0.3 percent against the dollar due to the strength of the greenback. The dollar was up 1 percent against a basket of major currencies.

U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their latest round of trade talks on Friday and were scheduled to resume discussions this week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit-for-tat tariff battle that has roiled global markets.

But the outlook for the dollar is expected to remain soft after the Federal Reserve last month abandoned projections for further interest rate hikes this year on signs of an economic slowdown in the United States.

Assuming continued dollar weakness and progress in trade talks, the yuan will likely hold on to its recent gains and appreciate modestly over the coming year, according to analysts in a new Reuters poll. It last traded around 6.72 to the dollar.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a trade deal could be announced in the next four weeks. But the U.S. trade office said on Saturday that significant work remains to be done. Discussions are set to resume this week.

The value of China's gold reserves fell slightly to $78.525 billion from $79.498 billion at the end of February.

REVERSAL OF FORTUNES?

For much of last year, global investors worried about the risk of capital flight from China as the economy cooled, and debated how much yuan weakness Beijing would allow, though strict capital controls kept outflows in check.

More recently, with the dollar on the backfoot, attention has turned to how much upward pressure Chinese policymakers will be comfortable with, as foreign inflows into the country's financial markets look set to boost the currency.

Chinese stocks have rallied more than 20 percent this year on trade deal hopes, while some Chinese bonds were added on April 1 to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, one of the most widely tracked fixed income benchmarks.

UBS Asset Management estimated this phase of bond inclusion will introduce $250-$500 billion of passive money alone, and possibly trillions of dollars if active money is counted.

The tide may also be turning for China's economy, with business surveys showing March manufacturing activity returned to growth, suggesting months of government stimulus measures are starting to take hold.

If sustained, improving economic data could prompt markets to scale back expectations of further policy easing, though analysts still expect several more cuts in banks' reserve requirements this year, possibly as soon as next week. - Reuters"

In its research note issued on Monday, it expects FY19F net gearing to hit 145% of equity upon the capitalisation of operating leases, with MFRS 16 effective since Jan 1, 2019.

“Target price cut to RM1.50 on lower core EPS forecasts (unchanged CY20F P/E of 10 times) and including expected dividends of 13 sen,” it said.

CIMB Research pointed out spot jet fuel prices have traded up to US$80 a barrel recently, exceeding its assumption of US$75 for FY19F. 

This is on the back of very strong determination by Saudi Arabia to cut its oil production in excess of its commitments to cut under the OPEC+ deal that took effect on Jan 1, 2019, continued declines in Venezuelan oil production due to ongoing US sanctions as well as the upcoming expiry on May 2 of the waivers granted by the US to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil since November 2018. 

The upcoming Jan 1, 2020 implementation of the low-sulphur limits for marine fuels under the IMO 2020 rules may also cause a rise in jet fuel crack spreads, impacting airlines, the research house said. 

In its base case estimate, the International Energy Agency expects diesel prices to rise by 20% in CY20F or up to 100% assuming strict enforcement of IMO 2020, against the research house’s assumption of 13% increase to US$85 for jet fuel. 

“AirAsia Group is partially shielded by hedges covering 52% of its oil needs in FY19F with an effective exercise price of c.US$78 of jet fuel and 40% of its oil needs in FY20F at US$60 Brent,” it said. 

CIMB Research also said AirAsia Group sold 79 aircraft to lessor BBAM during 2018 and is expected to sell a further 25 planes to lessor Castlelake by 3Q19F. 

“Given this, together with other existing operating lease aircraft, AirAsia Group is expected to capitalise RM11.8bn worth of borrowings related to the above operating leases in FY19F, effectively bringing back to the balance sheet what had previously been off-balance sheet. 

“The impact would be to raise reported gross gearing of 19% in FY18 to 198% on a proforma basis after MFRS 16. 

“The overall impact to P&L earnings from the above sale and leasebacks (S&LB) is negative because AirAsia Group would have to pay for the lessors’ profit margin as well as provide for a higher level of maintenance charges based on lessors’ conditions for lease returns, which tend to be strict. The net result would be a squeeze on AirAsia Group’s profit margins,” it said."

Bank of Thailand (BOT) Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob and Perry Warjiyo, governor of Bank Indonesia (BI) signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Cooperation in the Area of Payment Systems and Financial Innovation. 
Veerathai and Bank of Laos governor Sonexay Sitphaxay also signed an MoU on Cooperation in the Areas of Financial Innovation and Payments Systems. 
The MoU targets enhanced collaboration on financial innovations and payment services to promote more efficient and secured domestic and cross-border transactions as well as to promote the use of local currencies. 
The two central banks are working together to develop interoperable QR Code for payments and real-time remittance to facilitate cross-border retail payment services between Laos and Thailand.
“Our financial institutions have been collaborating to offer cross-border QR payments to enable easy and convenient payments for Lao and Thai tourists, as well as for SMEs in both countries to receive payments in an efficient, convenient way. Progress was also achieved in the area of corporate funds transfers between the two countries using blockchain technology,” said a BOT statement.
The Thai central bank also agreed to cooperate with central banks in Cambodia, Malaysia Myanmar, Philippines and Singapore on financial connectivity. 
Banks and non-bank operators in Asean have joined the bandwagon. 
“Today, we have witnessed collaboration among banks, non-banks and card companies to develop cross-border payment services using modern technologies, ranging from interoperable QR Code, blockchain technology, Application Programming Interface [API], and card networks. These new services can serve the needs of different customer segments, improve efficiency of the regional financial system, facilitate business transactions and international trade, reduce the cost of service providers and customers, and enhance financial inclusion for a broad range of Asean population,” said Veerathai.
The cooperation will also cut the cost of exchange-rate risk and streamline financial transactions.
Currently, migrants who send money back to their hometowns face high service fee for remittances. For example, people in Thailand transferring US$500 (RM2,045) out of the country are charged a US$36.40 service fee while the fees in Singapore and Malaysia are US$16 and US$15.50 respectively.

The re­port, re­leased re­cently by the Shar­ing Economy Re­search Cen­ter un­der the State Informa­tion Cen­ter, showed that in 2018, the transac­tion vol­ume of China’s shar­ing econ­omy mar­ket reached 2.94 tril­lion yuan (US$437.5bil), up 41.6% on an an­nual ba­sis.
There were 5.98 mil­lion em­ploy­ees reg­is­tered on shar­ing econ­omy plat­forms, up 7.5% year-on-year. A to­tal of 760 mil­lion peo­ple par­tic­i­pated in the sector, of which 75 mil­lion were ser­vice providers, up 7.1% from the pre­vi­ous year.
“China’s shar­ing econ­omy mar­ket and the employment in the sec­tor wit­nessed rapid growth de­spite ris­ing macroe­co­nomic down­ward pressure,” said Yu Fengxia, deputy di­rec­tor of the Shar­ing Econ­omy Re­search Cen­ter.
In­vest­ment into the coun­try’s shar­ing econ­omy sector dropped 23.2% year-on-year to 149 bil­lion yuan, mostly due to ra­tio­nal in­vest­ment pat­terns amid fierce com­pe­ti­tion in the ride-shar­ing sec­tor.
The re­port also showed that uni­corn com­pa­nies in the shar­ing econ­omy sec­tor were ex­pand­ing rapidly. In 2018, 11 shar­ing econ­omy com­pa­nies turned into uni­corns.
In ad­di­tion, as pointed out by the re­port, the sharing econ­omy is help­ing trans­form the ser­vices in­dus­try. By in­tro­duc­ing the shar­ing econ­omy, the structure of the ser­vices in­dus­try is con­stantly being op­ti­mised, and its scale is ex­pand­ing more rapidly.
From 2015 to 2018, the shar­ing econ­omy contributed 1.6%, 2.1% and 1.6%, re­spec­tively, to the growth of the travel, accommodation and catering industries.
The pen­e­tra­tion rate of shared ser­vices also increased. By June 2018, there were 570 mil­lion con­sumers mak­ing on­line pay­ments, 260 mil­lion more than the level of 2015, and the an­nual growth rate reached 16.9%. The pen­e­tra­tion of shared ser­vices among ne­ti­zens in­creased from 46.9% in 2015 to 71% in 2018, sta­tis­tics from China In­ter­net Net­work In­for­ma­tion Cen­ter showed.
“We are liv­ing in a so­ci­ety which con­stantly pursues ef­fi­ciency im­prove­ment. Re­sources that are not fully uti­lised give birth to the shar­ing economy. I am con­fi­dent that as the shar­ing economy pen­e­trates into more and more industries, it will cre­ate great value for our so­ci­ety,” said Li Xiao, found­ing part­ner of Joy Cap­i­tal.
Apart from its role in the ser­vice in­dus­try, the sharing econ­omy con­trib­utes to em­ploy­ment and con­sump­tion.
Zhao Dawei, di­rec­tor of the re­search cen­tre un­der Bei­jing-based on-de­mand ser­vices gi­ant Meituan Dian­ping, said food de­liv­ery ser­vices, as part of the shar­ing econ­omy sec­tor, have boosted employment in the coun­try.
“Take Meituan Waimai as an ex­am­ple. A to­tal of 2.7 mil­lion em­ploy­ers earned money from the platform in 2018, 22.7% higher than the pre­vi­ous year. There are over 600,000 ac­tive de­liv­ery drivers ev­ery day,” Zhao said, re­fer­ring to Meituan Dian­ping’s food de­liv­ery op­er­a­tion.
Yu of the Shar­ing Econ­omy Re­search Cen­ter said the shar­ing econ­omy will con­tinue to sta­bi­lise and pro­mote em­ploy­ment.
“As flex­i­ble work­ers, more and more peo­ple are able to par­tic­i­pate in shar­ing econ­omy ac­tiv­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to their in­ter­est, tech­nique, time and resources.
“Also, the shar­ing econ­omy’s po­ten­tial of stimulating con­sump­tion will be re­leased, as it can not only sat­isfy con­sumers’ needs lim­ited by the tra­di­tional ser­vice mode, but also boost their new con­sump­tion needs. As peo­ple’s con­sump­tion concepts change, shared ser­vices will pen­e­trate into peo­ple’s major fields of life, and serve as the main driv­ing force to fuel con­sump­tion,” Yu said.
As promis­ing as this is, chal­lenges still re­main. For ex­am­ple, the su­per­vi­sion mech­a­nism should be updated, the gov­ern­ment and en­ter­prises should in­crease the level of data shar­ing, and en­ter­prises in the shar­ing econ­omy sec­tor should bet­ter ful­fill their cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity. — China Daily/ANN"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/global-factory-activity-weak-in-march/,Global factory activity weak in March,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"FACTORY activity remained weak around the world last month, reinforcing worries of a global slowdown as forward-looking indicators pointed to gloomy times ahead, surveys showed last week.
Euro zone manufacturers had their weakest month for almost six years in March. While China showed a slight, surprising recovery last month, growth in new domestic and export orders was marginal, in a sign that stimulus already injected into Asia’s growth engine may not be enough.
Factory activity in Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan shrank further, adding to expectations of a dovish turn from central bankers.
Britain was an anomaly, with manufacturing growth at an unexpected 13-month high, but that was driven by factories stockpiling for Brexit at an explosive rate, unlike anything seen before in a major rich economy.
“The jump in the UK manufacturing PMI in March largely reflects producers rushing to complete work before the Brexit deadline, rather than a strengthening of underlying demand,” said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Figures from Germany and France, the euro zone’s two biggest economies, showed manufacturing activity contracted, as it did in Italy. Growth returned in Spain after a brief dip in February but activity was still stagnating.
So IHS Markit’s March final manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone declined for an eighth month, coming in at 47.5 from February’s 49.3, its lowest reading since April 2013.
“The fall in the manufacturing PMI shows that the industrial recession is still deepening,” said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
Casting a shadow over the bloc’s outlook, new orders fell at their fastest rate in over six years, backlogs of work were run down at their fastest pace since late 2012 and factories curtailed purchases of raw materials as they stockpiled unsold products.
The weak global environment is feeding back into the U.S. economy, prompting the Federal Reserve to abruptly end its policy tightening last month and causing the Treasury yield curve to briefly invert last week - a potential signal of a looming recession.
A pause from the Fed has changed the game for many central banks and investors are betting on a growing list of potential rate cutters.
Last month, the European Central Bank changed its outlook. It pushed back the timing of an interest rate rise until 2020 at the earliest and said it would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.
“The big picture is that with the economy performing poorly, pressure is soon likely to build on the ECB to increase its policy support,” said Jack Allen at Capital Economics.
China’s Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI expanded at the strongest pace in eight months in March, rising to 50.8 from 49.9, the highest level since July 2018.
An official survey released on March 31 also showed modest expansion.
Economists cautioned there were seasonal factors in play, with activity in March traditionally picking up markedly whenever the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays fell in February, as they did this year.
But if the trend is sustained, it could mark the turnaround China’s policymakers had hoped for after some heavy fiscal and monetary stimulus, including five cuts in bank reserve requirements in the past year, although analysts say more measures may be in the pipeline.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last month the government has additional monetary policy measures that it can take, and will even cut “its own flesh” to help finance large-scale tax cuts.
On the trade front, US President Donald Trump said talks with China were going very well, but cautioned he would not accept anything less than a “great deal” after top US and Chinese trade officials wrapped up two days of negotiations in Beijing.
“A set of better economic numbers on the Chinese side could raise the bargaining chips in negotiations with the US, as they could show that the Chinese economy can still bounce back from the tariffs imposed by the US so far,” said Kevin Lai, chief Asia ex-Japan economist at Daiwa Capital Markets.
The US-China tariff war and slowing Chinese demand after a campaign to reduce financial risk-taking have caused broad damage, hurting everyone from small firms in the supply chains of Chinese manufacturers to global tech behemoths such as Apple.
Activity in Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines grew at a modest pace, but in economies with a larger impact on Asian growth the outlook remained bleak.
South Korea’s factory activity in March contracted for a fifth straight month.
Japanese manufacturing activity contracted at a slower pace in March, but output fell at the sharpest rate in nearly three years. Japanese business confidence worsened to a two-year low in the first quarter of this year, a central bank survey showed. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/new-yorks-fashion-startup-scene-gets-the-red-carpet/,New York’s fashion startup scene gets the red carpet,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"NEW York’s startup fashion scene is trending among venture capitalists. Record amounts of funding are being raised, leading to two freshly minted billion-dollar companies in the past two weeks. 
And there are more waiting in the wings, buoyed by the convergence of online shopping and Instagram. 
Glossier Inc, a direct-to-consumer skincare and makeup startup, and Rent the Runway Inc, an online service for borrowing designer fashions and accessories, announced last month that they’ve hit unicorn status after recent funding rounds. Wedding-planning platform Zola Inc and luxury designer website Moda Operandi Inc are both currently valued at around US$650mil, PitchBook data shows, well ahead of where others have been before a final injection of capital vaulted them across the billion-dollar line.
These new companies are more than just fashion and beauty startups, says Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner Ventures. They’re building revolutionary business models that are powered by intimate relationships with consumers. “This is why investors are clamouring to get involved, and this is just the beginning,” Kim says.
The total venture capital investment in fashion and beauty tech startups in New York rose 30% last year to hit a record US$612mil, according to data from PitchBook. So far this year, the industry has already brought in US$349mil, putting it on pace for a new high. 
New York has been seeing a surge in venture capital in general recently, and has been turning out unicorns in other sectors too, such as mattress startup Casper. 
Amazon.com Inc’s recent about-face on opening a new, huge office park in Long Island City was viewed by some as a potential blow to the city’s startup scene, though it hasn’t seemed to had an effect yet, at least on this corner of the market.
New York’s roots as a fashion leader go back decades, from the start of the annual Fashion Week in 1943, to Vogue magazine and the luxury shopping strip of Fifth Avenue that’s home to the likes of local brands Coach and Ralph Lauren. Entrepreneurs have been able to draw on the deep industry knowledge of local world-class designers, pattern makers and beauty specialists, while also tapping into top tech talent that’s been growing in the city. That’s helped spawn seven unicorns in the industry over time, out of a total of 13 across the country, according to PitchBook.

New York’s legends in the fashion and beauty industry, as categorised by PitchBook, include Etsy Inc, which is now an US$8.4bil public company and glasses purveyor Warby Parker, which hit the symbolic billion-dollar status back in 2015. Makeup line Pat McGrath Labs became a unicorn last year. 
But many other promising startups either got bought before reaching unicorn status or fizzled before making a splashy public market debut. Fashion and beauty subscription pioneer Birchbox, sold a majority stake to private equity firm Viking Global last year; men’s clothing startup Bonobos, was acquired by Walmart Inc in 2017. And the one that started it all, Gilt Groupe, the city’s first fashion unicorn, was valued at more than US$1bil in 2011 with backing from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank Group, only to be sold first to Hudson’s Bay for US$250mil and then to Rue La La last year for less than US$100mil. 
But if Gilt lost some of its lustre, its legend lives on through the many executives and co-founders who went on to build some of the new crop of startups, including Shan-Lyn Ma, the founder of Zola. 
“We saw the rapid rise and then fall of Gilt,” Ma said. “We learned a great deal about what to do and what not to do.” 
The startup has tripled its number of employees in the past two years, is gearing up to launch a new website and recently opened its first store, where else but on Fifth Avenue.
What’s also changed this time around is the rapid rise of online shopping and social media that connects companies with their consumers and helps trends go viral.  
Glossier started out as a beauty blog where it established a loyal following before becoming one of the rare beauty companies that does almost all of its business online. The company promotes its house-brand serums, balms and milky cleansers to some 2 million followers on Instagram where its pages are minimalist and pink and encourage fans to engage with feedback and questions. 
Rent the Runway’s Instagram feed is an “unlimited closet”, as one co-founder describes it, with a parade of photos of real people in all shapes and sizes wearing their rented gowns. 
A successful social media strategy has allowed the startups to disrupt traditional players who lack a digital footprint, said Scott Friend, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, which backs Rent the Runway. Friend said the appeal stems from the fact that both companies have a “rabid customer following” giving them a steep competitive edge. 
“The result is great investor enthusiasm to invest now while these companies are still, remarkably, in the early innings of very, very large markets.” 
Glossier founder Emily Weiss says there’s always been significant customer demand for women-focused businesses, but it’s only recently that they’ve seen “meaningful capital investment into categories like beauty.” The long-standing assumption has been that these types of businesses aren’t disruptive or ‘world changing’ enough, despite massive markets and loyal consumers, Weiss said. 
“As the venture community slowly becomes more diverse and we see new types of success stories, I think this perspective will continue to evolve.” 
Rent the Runway co-founder Jennifer Hyman agreed. 
“New York City will continue to be a place where disruptive and next-gen fashion and beauty companies get started and grow,” she said.
New York is the stomping ground of dozens of scrappy fashion upstarts, from clothing rental subscription services like Gwynnie Bee to custom high-heel maker True Gault. It’s also home to dozens of tech beauty startups like Swivel Beauty, an app dedicated to hair care for African American women, Glamsquad, which delivers on-demand hair stylists and makeup artists to your door, and cruelty-free cosmetic brand Winky Lux. 
Natalie Mackey, chief executive officer of  Winky Lux, said the boom of tech-savvy fashion brands has permanently disrupted the industry. 
“This new breed of company is nimble, innovative and able to speak to the customer directly,” she said. “Venture continues to lead the charge in backing founders with better and better understanding of how to inspire and galvanize young customers. Incumbents should be terrified by startups that are able to act instantly on feedback.”
The recent success stories are even luring tiny startups like online styling app Wishi away from Silicon Valley and towards the bright lights of midtown Manhattan. Wishi co-founder Clea O’hana Harroch said the company began relocating to the Big Apple in March because she thinks there’s no better place for a budding fashion and beauty business. 
“Our goal is to be one of the unicorns and it’s really why we want to put all our chances on our side to get there,” she said. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/creating-opportunities/,Creating opportunities,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"“THERE is this stereotype that youngsters nowadays give up very easily, but this is because they don’t see what we are actually going through. They don’t see the difficulties we face when applying for jobs, they only see, ‘Oh, this kid is very choosy’.” 
Those are the words of 26-year-old Sharifah Syahirah Tuan Abdul Rahim, a senior supervisor from the risk management department at Duopharma Biotech Bhd. 
“It’s not that we want to think about the money, but we have to for our own survival – everything is so pricey these days,” she continues. 
This is especially true for individuals who live far away from their families and hometown, like herself. 
“I don’t have anybody here. I can be independent, but it feels like there’s no safety net – it’s dangerous when things are so uncertain,” says Sharifah.
Indeed, it seems that it is becoming more and more challenging for fresh graduates to secure a job these days, as there are just not enough jobs to match the number of diploma and degree holders entering the workforce each year. 
The Bank Negara Malaysia Annual Report 2018 suggests that this is because the economy has not created sufficient high-skilled jobs to absorb the number of college and university graduates. The report also revealed that the real monthly starting salary for most fresh graduates has decreased since 2010.  
Sharifah’s colleague, Lavaniya Panirselvam, shares that some of her friends have turned to entrepreneurship to supplement their income.

“I see some of my university friends working for companies, but also doing their own part-time business. Being in the current generation right now, it’s really as if we are in a pressure cooker. We are pressured by so many expectations from the people around us,” says the 27-year-old who is from Duopharma Biotech’s regulatory affairs department.
“I think that’s one of the reasons graduates are looking for a side business to support themselves even though they already have a job,” she adds.
Muhamad Ikmal Aliff Muhamad Nasir, an operational excellence executive at the same company, says that he had always thought it would be easier to get a job as a graduate from an overseas university, but found that this was not the case when he returned from the UK in 2017.
The 24-year-old elaborates that employers in Malaysia focus too much on a candidate’s grades and are not even willing to accept resumes from those whose CGPAs are below a certain figure. 
“Many local graduates graduate with flying colours, I’d say like (a CGPA of) 3.8 and above, which is a first class, but it’s really difficult for those in overseas universities to even get a second upper class.”
He feels that this is unfair to overseas graduates, as employers just dismiss candidates based on the final result without considering the effort it took to get there.
Lavaniya chips in, “I don’t know why they (employers) always focus on grades and don’t want to accept the fact that not all grades (from different universities) are of equal quality.”
Serving a bigger purpose
This is where the Professional Training and Education for Growing Entrepreneurs (PROTÉGÉ) comes in. Formerly known as Skim Latihan 1Malaysia (SL1M), this programme under the Entrepre­neur Development Ministry (MED) includes new modules on entrepreneurial skills in addition to the existing employability training modules.
This is to encourage the nation’s youth to expand their horizons and make a living through entrepreneurship, instead of being fixated on securing a job with a company. By starting their own businesses, graduates will become job creators who create opportunities for others rather than compete with other job seekers in an increasingly competitive workforce.

 
Third time lucky: Sharifah Syahirah secures a job after going through the programme the third time.


According to MED secretary-general Wan Suraya Wan Mohd Radzi, the focus of the programme is in line with the 10th strategic objective of the National Entrepreneurship Framework (NEF), which is to cultivate entrepreneurial skills in unemployed graduates.
She adds that PROTÉGÉ is collaborating with more parties now, with new strategic partnerships that include small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and multinational companies (MNCs), in addition to government-linked companies (GLCs) which have been the main supporters of the SL1M programme before this.
Previously, only university graduates were eligible for the programme, but it is now open to diploma holders, school leavers, and students as well, especially those from low-income families or rural areas.
Wan Suraya says: “We hope that with PROTÉGÉ, high technology companies need not approach the government to get foreign workers, at least for the relevant technical positions. The number of participants from programmes such as PROTÉGÉ should be able to fill their needs in terms of manpower. This is in line with the current wave of change in the economy and Industrial Revolution 4.0.
“We will set up a suitable system so that any Malaysian citizen who wants to start their own business can come to us for guidance or support. This support is not necessarily in the form of cash loans – I think the days of easy money are gone – it is about sharing knowledge regarding the various entrepreneurial options out there.” 
Giving graduates hope 
Sharifah, Lavaniya and Muhamad Ikmal are just three out of the 64 trainees who graduated from the PROTÉGÉ-Duopharma Biotech Bhd 2018 programme on March 21. When asked about their thoughts regarding PROTÉGÉ and if they had any advice for others, this is what they had to say: “I think the new direction is interesting as I see that people nowadays are more into entrepreneurship, because they feel that being bonded to a company or working for others is quite restrictive,” says Lavaniya.
She continues: “When they go into entrepreneurship, they can actually explore for themselves without being limited by anyone’s boundaries. It also helps them develop their self-confidence because they are going to be on their own and they have to make sure they do everything well. I think it is actually a good idea.”

 
Overcoming challenges: Muhamad Ikmal advises graduates not to give up even if they do not get good results.


Muhamad Ikmal says: “Don’t ever give up even if you don’t get good results – we all have to go through a few challenging things before we can get a job. I submitted more than 100 resumes on JobStreet within two months and didn’t get a single response. In the end, I actually turned up at the companies and submitted my resume in person, and managed to secure two interviews. If you start to give up, then that’s it.”
Sharifah agrees. After being a PROTÉGÉ trainee twice and having failed to obtain a permanent position with the two companies, she doubted her decision to accept yet another PROTÉGÉ placement, this time at Duopharma Biotech. 
However, she has since been absorbed into the company and has no regrets.
“The mindset they should have is to keep trying. I’ve been there. There is always a chance for you, it’s just a matter of time. So, give it a try and don’t look down on any programme, because you never know how it will turn out. Even if you’re a contract worker, just do your best, because people will value you for that. If you put honest and sincere effort into your work, then they will see that,” says Sharifah.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/corbyn-im-waiting-for-may-to-move-brexit-red-lines/,Corbyn: I’m waiting for May to move Brexit ‘red lines’,Business News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"LONDON:Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to move the “red lines” that have blocked a deal for Britain to leave the EU, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Saturday, after May launched talks with him in a last-ditch bid to save Brexit.
With Britain due to leave the bloc on April 12 and no sign of her minority government being able to pass a deal through parliament on its own, May turned to Labour Party leader Corbyn in recent days in the hope of securing a bi-partisan agreement.
A deal with Corbyn could be May’s last chance to deliver Brexit without either a long delay or leaving with no deal at all. But Corbyn said the prime minister had yet to show the flexibility that Labour would need to say yes.
“I’m waiting to see the red lines move,” he told the BBC. “I hope we can reach a decision in parliament this week which will prevent a crashing out.”
No talks have been arranged yet between the two sides for this weekend, a Labour source told Reuters. May’s decision to seek an agreement with Corbyn was an astounding reversal after months of saying her plan for Brexit was the only possible course. It reflects weeks of high drama in parliament that saw May’s deal rejected by a historic majority but no agreement emerge on an alternative plan.
While both major parties have said they are committed to carrying out the results of Britain’s 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, Labour has long demanded a softer break than May has been willing to consider.
In particular, Labour seeks a customs union with the EU after Britain leaves, which would cross one of the “red lines” May set out at the start of negotiations by preventing Britain from setting its own trade tariffs.
Many Labour lawmakers also want a second referendum on the terms of Brexit, which May says would be a fundamental threat to Britain’s democracy after the vote to leave. Her decision to open talks with Labour infuriated Brexit supporters in May’s Conservative party and divided her cabinet.
With time running out, May has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain’s exit from the bloc until June 30. The EU, which gave her a two-week extension the last time she asked, insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice-rejected divorce deal in the British parliament. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/yens-outlook-worsens-as-traders-turn-bearish/,Yen’s outlook worsens as traders turn bearish,Business News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"SINGAPORE: The omens are looking bad for the yen.Traders have boosted short positions on Japan’s currency for six straight weeks as signs that economic growth is slowing make it more likely the central bank will maintain its record monetary stimulus.At the same time, global risk sentiment is improving as the United States and China near a deal to resolve their long-running trade dispute, sapping demand for haven assets.Japanese data due this week may add to the bearish yen mood: economists predict machine orders probably shrank from a year earlier in February, while producer price inflation was near a two-year low in March. The Bank of Japan’s Tankan survey released last week showed manufacturers’ confidence tumbled the most in six years in the first quarter, while the government is set to raise the sales tax to 10% from 8% in October.Even one normally yen-positive factor has so far failed to offer much relief. The extra yield on US Treasuries over Japanese government bonds fell to the lowest in more than a year last month, but only gave the yen a short-lived boost.A more important factor than the yield spread appears to be investment flows. Japanese investors bought a net 7.85 trillion yen (US$70.3bil) of overseas stocks and bonds this year through March 29, compared with 20.1 trillion yen they sent abroad last year, according to Ministry of Finance data.“The dollar tends to be supported during this time of the year as Japanese investors are expected to allocate more of their funds abroad,” said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank & Trust Co. “These seasonal flows are expected to keep the yen under pressure. US dollar/yen could weaken toward 112.30,” he said.The yen has fallen 2.8% versus the dollar over the past three months to trade at 111.67 per dollar late on Friday in Tokyo. A break beyond the March 5 low of 112.14 would put it at the weakest this year.The technical outlook remains bearish. The dollar-yen currency pair has rallied after dropping to support at around 110 at the end of March. Slow stochastics, a momentum indicator, shows a per cent D reading of 63, still below overbought territory, indicating there is still room for the pair to run higher. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/to-shoo-away-the-bond-markets-doves-inflation-needs-to-show-up/,"To shoo away the bond market’s doves, inflation needs to show up",Business News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"NEW YORK: It’s going to take a lot to dispel the bond market’s view that the world’s biggest economy needs stimulus, but some consistent signals on inflation would help.The rebound in March payrolls may have allayed concern that US growth is headed for a ditch, and supported the updraft in yields seen last week. But the weaker-than-expected wage growth in Friday’s employment data still left futures markets reflecting a 70% chance of a quarter-point Federal Reserve rate cut this year.That’s well out of step with the central bank’s current signalling, that it will pause through 2019 and potentially hike again next year.“For the market to begin pricing in a hike, we will need to see persistent inflation pressures,” said Noelle Corum, a portfolio manager in the fixed-income group at Invesco Advisers Inc. Her expectation is that inflation will quicken enough by year-end to justify another rate increase.Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield 2.5%. That’s up about 16 basis points from the 15-month low set in March as last week also brought encouraging signs on growth from China. Friday’s US figures also confirmed that the American jobless rate remains close to the lowest in decades.While bond prices may seem out of step with the tight labour market, they jibe pretty well with investors’ grim outlook for inflation, says Martin Hegarty at Garda Capital Partners. He says the pricing in inflation markets translates to a sustained undershoot on the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, a phenomenon that would typically justify easing. The central bank’s target for that measure is 2%. It’s now at 1.4%.Consumer prices probably rose 1.8% in March from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey before this week’s report. In the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), traders see that clip continuing for the next five years.“We think the path of inflation priced into the TIPS market is too low,” particularly with officials planning to revisit their inflation-targeting framework, said Hegarty, a global fixed-income portfolio manager focused on inflation markets.Investors are about to get more insight into the Fed’s thinking on how it’s meeting its inflation mandate. This week brings the minutes from last month’s policy meeting, after which traders ramped up easing bets in response to the Fed’s downward revisions to economic and interest-rate projections.As for market drivers, this week’s inflation data may fail to force traders out of their dovish positions.Hegarty says a 0.3% monthly increase in the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, could get the market’s attention. That reading would be above consensus and a pickup from 0.1% in February. On an annual basis, core consumer inflation probably remained at 2.1%.If the inflation data fizzle, the best catalyst to push traders to a more neutral position on rates would have to come from overseas, he says. — Bloomberg"

US President Donald Trump had thrown last year’s summit of the club of major industrial countries in Canada into disarray, backing out of a joint communique and firing barbs at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
France, which now has the G7 presidency, scaled back its ambitions for the latest meeting, focusing on areas where consensus could be found including the dangers of cyber crime for democracy, tackling inequalities between men and women, and trafficking in Africa’s Sahel region.
“Last year there was an end of G7 that did not go very well but the G7 here in Dinard went very well,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian (pic) told reporters, seeking to put a positive spin on the two-day meeting.
The meeting was overshadowed by the absence of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who sent his deputy in his place. One diplomat said it sent a message that he “had better things to do”.
However, it did lay out ambitions for a cyber security initiative designed to help protect liberal democracies and defend civil liberties from digital attacks, though it was the turmoil in Libya that appeared to unite them the most.
As eastern commander Khalifa Haftar swept towards Tripoli, they pressed him to halt his forces’ advance on the capital as concerns grow of a civil war resurgence.
Urging restraint from all factions, the G7 said Libya’s oil installations should not be used by any group for political gain. 
“At least there seems to be a good degree of convergence on Libya from the international community,” Italy’s Foreign Minister Enzo Milanesi told reporters.
Despite that unity, Le Drian pointed out that differences on key issues were still evident, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how to handle Iran.
“Despite the crisp air of Dinard, we couldn’t overcome some of our differences,” Le Drian said.
A spokeswoman for Japan’s foreign ministry described the debate as friendly but at times heated and frank.
President Trump last year pulled the United States out of Iran’s international nuclear deal, rejecting the approach favoured by Washington’s allies to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
The final communique made no mention of the Iran accord, which France, Britain and Germany continue to abide by. 
However, it outlined concerns over Iran’s regional and ballistic missile activities, and its human rights record.
“We intend to continue our work to counter Iran’s regional proliferation of ballistic missiles and its unlawful arms transfers,” the communique said.
The biggest difference was on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
In March, Trump recognized Israel’s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights in an election boost for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, drawing direct or implied criticism from the European Union and European capitals.
“We had an exchange of views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and there were clear differences,” the communique read.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/ai-to-double-rate-of-innovation-in-malaysia/,AI to double rate of innovation in Malaysia,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"THE application of artificial intelligence (AI) in businesses will not only increase employee productivity but also double the rate of innovation by 2021, business leaders opine. 
According to a study from Microsoft and IDC Asia Pacific titled Future Ready Business: Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI, employee productivity is expected to improve by 60% in Malaysia.
The study surveyed 100 business leaders and 100 workers in Malaysia.
However, it notes that while seven in 10 business leaders polled agreed that AI is instrumental for their organisation’s competitiveness, only 26% of organisations in Malaysia have embarked on their AI journeys. 
Companies that have adopted AI expect to increase their competitiveness by 2.2 times in 2021.
“Today, every company is a software company, and increasingly, every interaction is digital. To be successful in this new world, organisations need to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology, and secondly, they need to build their own unique digital capabilities,” says Microsoft Malaysia managing director K. Raman.
“AI is the defining technology of our time that significantly accelerates business transformation, enables innovation, boosts employee productivity, and ensures further growth.
“Economies and businesses that have yet to embark on their AI journey run a real risk of missing out on the competitive benefits that are enjoyed by leaders.”
The study further notes the top five drivers for organisations that have implemented AI initiatives were better customer engagements (31% of respondents), higher competitiveness (31%), accelerated innovation (12%), improved efficiency (12%) and having more productive employees (8%).
“Last year, organisations that have adopted AI saw tangible improvements in those areas in the range of 17% to 34%. They forecast further improvements of at least 1.6 times in the three-year horizon, with the biggest jump expected in accelerated innovation, higher competitiveness and better customer engagements,” says Chin Jun-Fwu, research director for IDC Asia Pacific Datacenter Group.
The study uncovered that Malaysia needs to focus on improving on all areas, particularly its data and investments, in order to accelerate its AI journey.
“Malaysia is not ready yet for AI. To succeed in the AI race, Malaysia needs to substantially improve its readiness. 
“Organisations’ leadership should make AI a core part of their strategy and develop a learning agility culture. 
“They have to continuously invest in this transformative technology for the long-term success, sometimes without immediate returns.
“There is an urgent need for talents and tools to develop, deploy and monitor AI models, along with the availability of a robust data estate with the adequate governance,” adds Chin.
The top three challenges faced by business leaders who are adopting AI include a lack of thought leadership and leadership commitment to invest in AI, a lack of skills, resources and continuous learning programmes as well as a lack of advanced analytics or adequate infrastructure and tools to develop actionable insights.
The study showed that to move ahead in their AI journeys, businesses must create the right organisational culture to enable more risk-taking, proactive innovation and cross-function among teams.
Interestingly, the study found that Malaysia’s business leaders and workers generally hold positive viewpoints about AI’s impact on the future of jobs. 
About 67% of business leaders and 64% of workers believe that AI will either help them do their existing jobs better or reduce repetitive tasks.
“About 17% of business leaders believe that AI will create new jobs, while 10% also feel that the technology will replace jobs. 
“Workers are more optimistic, with only 7% expecting AI to replace jobs, and 18% to create new ones. At the same time, almost 11% of workers expect no impact to their jobs three years from now,” says Chin.
The study also found that workers are more willing to reskill than business leaders believe they are. Some 23% of business leaders felt that workers have no interest to develop new skills, but only 10% of workers were not interested.
“It is heartening to see that 82% of businesses prioritise skilling and reskilling of workers in the future. They plan to invest as much, or even more, in human capital than in new technology.
“Even so, 72% of business leaders have yet to implement plans to help their employees’ acquire the right skills, which is worrying in today’s context. They must have the urgency to support the fundamental shift in training workers for the future,” notes Raman.
“As technology changes the rules of business, it is imperative to future-proof the Malaysian economy by building a strong digital innovation ecosystem. The potential of AI is far from being fully exploited.
“Malaysian businesses need to jump onto the bandwagon to embrace digital transformation and leverage digital technologies such as AI to accelerate the shift towards IR4 and retain their competitive edge,” says Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) data economy director Dr Karl Ng Kah Hou.
MDEC expects to complete the development of the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Framework by year-end to drive the country’s AI ecosystem."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/wary-eyes-on-europes-sclerotic-growth/,Wary eyes on Europe’s sclerotic growth,Business News,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"FRANKFURT: Europe’s sclerotic growth and political dysfunction inspire frequent comparisons with Japan’s lost decade from the mid-1990s. It’s not there yet.The region’s bout of misery this year – Germany’s industrial slump and the struggle to fix its banks, Italy’s inability to reform, the apparent defeat of central bankers seeking to wean the eurozone off stimulus – may seem to make perpetual malaise look inevitable.The eurozone’s economy is similar in important ways to its Asian counterpart two decades ago: Interest rates at or below zero, the mountains of debt and non-performing loans, populations transitioning from an ageing society to an aged one.Economists insist there are limits to the comparison, though, while acknowledging that a prolonged period of European stasis, deflation and central bank impotence remains a threat.“I’m very worried about it,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, whose areas of expertise include both Japan and Germany. “Europe’s Japanification is a real risk.”Japan’s so-called lost decade, triggered by the bursting of a bubble in stocks and real estate, pushed the economy into anaemic growth or none at all, with rising unemployment and falling interest rates.Here are some of the ways Europe is heading in that direction – and some of the ways it isn’t.Dwindling workforceThe eurozone’s working-age population has decreased as people live longer and have fewer children. Overall population growth is set to peak in 2045, according to Eurostat, so the region is well on track to match Japan. There, the population has fallen for the last seven years; one in three people is now age 60 or older.Ageing populations are often thought to weaken inflation pressures, as people save for retirement and spend less per capita.Japan’s demographic squeeze has brought more women and old people into work and pushed the overall unemployment rate to 2.3%, near the lowest level in more than two decades. Yet wage growth is tepid, insufficient to spur inflation.In the eurozone, on the other hand, unemployment is still above its pre-crisis low, yet workers’ pay has started to improve, a signal ECB officials frequently cite as evidence that price growth will pick up.Monetary policyThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) has battled deflation for much of the last two decades. The European Central Bank (ECB) got a taste of that struggle in 2009 amid a recession and in the aftermath of the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis. While Japan’s woes began abruptly at the start of the 1990s, the eurozone slid more gently into weak inflation and growth.The BoJ was the first major central bank to embrace radical monetary policy, yet it’s still locked into negative interest rates and asset purchases, and weighing more easing. The ECB is a long way from raising rates. While it may be unable to adopt more BoJ-like measures if the slowdown worsens, the bank could be locked into its current stance for a while.“By refusing to ease policy appropriately, the BoJ created a situation where the country had to stay with near-zero interest rates for 20 years,” said Athanasios Orphanides, a former ECB policy maker. “If you look at it like that, 2020 or 2021 might become completely impossible for the ECB to hike.”Inflation expectationsWhile inflation in the eurozone has picked up, it’s still below the ECB’s goal of just under 2%, and the core rate is stuck around 1%.The ECB says the risk that markets anticipate even slower inflation is “very low”. Investors are less sanguine: A gauge based on derivatives prices has plunged to 1.3%, the lowest level since 2016 – when the ECB was buying bonds at a rate of 80 billion euros (US$90bil) a month.Debt and yieldsJapan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is now above 230%, and rising as deficits pile up. European Union rules impose fiscal limits that will limit such a buildup. The eurozone’s ratio is 89% and is forecast to decline slowly, though a weaker economy and the need for fiscal stimulus could hamper progress.Still, bond yields tell a worrying story: German borrowing costs are converging with those of Japan.“Japan and the eurozone are not that dissimilar,” said Andrew Bosomworth, a money manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. “We’re just following in their footsteps.”MigrationThe eurozone’s more dynamic labour market, with both external and internal migration, is a key caveat to comparisons with Japan.Net inflows of migrants peaked in 2015 as a recovering European economy coincided with instability in North Africa and the Middle East. That helped soften declines in the working-age population. More recently, however, Europeans have grown resistant to large-scale immigration. Annual net inflows into the euro area will decrease in the coming decades, according to Eurostat.Japan, with 126 million people, has only about 1.3 million foreign workers and remains opposed to a formal immigration policy. The government is likely to issue five-year residency permits to as many as 345,000 low-skilled workers over the next five years. That would plug about one-quarter of the predicted labour shortfall. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/a-hub-for-5g-rf-chip-production/,A hub for 5G RF chip production,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"PENANG is one of a handful of manufacturing sites in Asia with a 5G (fifth-generation mobile networks) radio frequency (RF) chip production facility. And the state has become an important production site for Mini-Circuits Technologies (Malaysia), a subsidiary of New York-based Scientific Component.
It is now producing one million 5G RF chips a month for use in 5G telecommunication base stations worldwide.
“We started 5G RF chip production in 2018.
“The plan is to increase the output to between 40 million and 50 million units in three years, depending on how fast telcos worldwide are able to implement 5G base stations,” says Datuk Seri Kelvin Kiew, president and chief executive officer of Mini-Circuits.
In Penang, Mini-Circuits produces 5G mmWave and sub-6 GHZ chips.
What is the fuss over 5G?
“In layman’s terms, 5G, the successor to 4G, is 100 times faster than 4G, with speeds that reach 10 gigabits per second. 
“This would let consumers download a full-length high-definition movie in seconds. 
“5G will have enhanced bandwidth, allowing it to accommodate the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) such as smart refrigerators to traffic lights to dog collars, enabling them to transmit and receive data.

 
Faster speed: The 5G technology will benefit both businesses and consumers, says Kiew.


“The potential benefits to 5G are vast for both businesses and consumers – for the former, the additional capacity and speed should allow for greater mobile working whilst for consumers, the speed should offer additional benefits within the ability of your smartphone. 5G is also crucial to the full implementation of AI (artificial intelligence) worldwide.
“For example, a business using a 5G network would mean employees can video conference from any location whilst for consumers, 5G could allow you to download a film to your smartphone in under a second,” Kiew says.
Penang is an important manufacturing site for Mini-Circuits, contributing about 10% of the 5G RF chips – valued at about US$350mil – to be shipped out by the group over the next few years.
“The value of the 5G RF chips shipped out from Penang is estimated to be about US$80mil for 2019, of which, about half of the amount is for the China market,” he says.
In the initial phase, the sub-6 GHZ application will dominate production, as it provides reasonable bandwidth speed and wider coverage.
“In the subsequent phase, the mmWave will be used in areas where there is a need for multi-gigabit communication services.
“The objective with mmWave is to increase the data bandwidth available over smaller, densely populated areas. 
“It will be a key part of 5G in many cities, powering data in sports stadiums, malls, and convention centres, as well as basically anywhere that data congestion might be a problem. 
“Out in rural towns and villages, sub-6 GHz and low bands below 2 GHz will probably play a more crucial role in ensuring consistent coverage,” Kiew says.
A problem with mmWave is that the signal cannot penetrate walls.
“However, the mmWave will leverage the support from 5G base stations to bounce around until a decent signal is transmitted.
“When it rains, the signal will be impacted.
“Our manufacturing site worldwide, including Penang, will work on improving both the mmWave and sub-6 GHZ band RF modules to overcome the limitations,” he adds.
According to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA) forecast, by 2025, there will be 1.2 billion 5G connections worldwide, with 5G networks covering almost 40% of the global population.
Asia Pacific will account for more than half of these, or 675 million 5G connections, by 2025.
But when will 5G become a reality?
“The first 5G compatible phones will become available in the middle of this year, but consumers will not initially notice vastly faster speeds because 5G coverage will be limited to certain cities or neighbourhoods at first.
“Analysts predict it will be at least a couple of years before the network’s reach will be extensive enough to let you use your 5G phone without relying on current wireless standards most of the time,” he says.
“We had a record year in 2018 shipping over US$400mil worth of RF products that includes filters, power splitters, and amplifiers.
“Growth in 2019 will be between 5% and 10%, impacted by the trade war and the overall slow down in the handheld products. 
“Our Malaysia facility is expected to ship US$150mil worth of RF products in 2019,” Kiew concludes."

No. Would I be thrilled and honored if I make it through this process? Yes. That’s the bottom line.”US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to nominate Cain, a former pizza chain executive. “I have recommended him highly for the Fed,” Trump said.“I’ve told my folks that’s the man.”Cain’s nomination would need to be approved by the U.S. Senate. “They have to collect an inordinate amount of information on you, your background, your family, your friends, your animals, your pets, for the last 50 years,” Cain said.Cain said people who dislike him are “already digging up all of the negative stuff that’s in storage from eight years ago.” He added, “I will be able to explain it this time.”Cain led opinion polls for a while during the Republican nominating contests, buoyed by his signature 9-9-9 tax proposal, which would have levied a flat 9% corporate, income and sales tax.But his popularity slipped amid sexual harassment allegations from several women, which he denied as “completely false.”Cain made his fortune as chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza before launching a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. Trump has been a strident critic of the Fed’s rate hikes under Jerome Powell, whom the president picked two years ago to chair the US central bank. Trump’s other Fed appointees have also supported the Powell Fed’s rate hikes, which the president has said hurt the economy. — Reuters"

EDT on Saturday. This echoes the hysteria - mostly overhyped - over global computers systems that gripped the world when the calendar was about to click over from 1999 to 2000.Fortunately, the glitch only affects older GPS systems or ones that haven’t been updated, and the US Department of Homeland Security says it isn’t expecting wide-scale disruptions. But they’ve still been warning that utilities, financial systems, airlines and telecommunication systems could be affected by the problem.  “A nanosecond error in GPS Time can equate to one foot of position (ranging) error,” the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a memo warning about the problem.The issue is caused by the “1024 week number rollover.”  GPS systems keep track of time by counting weeks, but only have enough data to keep track of 1,024 of them before they reset to Jan. 6, 1980, when the system first went online. The last time that happened was in August 1999 when GPS was used a lot less for everything from flying planes to mapping the best driving routes to locating lost pets. The next reset occurs tonight.The navigation technology manufacturer TomTom NV told users “there’s no need to worry” if you frequently update your device, but said those who don’t may find “navigation impossible” among other problems.Garmin LTD said its testing has shown the “vast majority” of its GPS devices will handle the rollover without issue, and those that are affected will see an incorrect date and time displayed but “the positioning accuracy will not be affected.” But other industries that rely on precise time could see an impact. Edward Powers, the GPS Operations Division Chief for the United States Naval Observatory, warned in a 2017 presentation that the rollover could lead to corrupted data and system failures, with problems occurring beyond April 6. — Bloomberg"

Polls suggest such a measure could pass, forcing the city to consider spending billions of euros buying privatised housing back.Demonstrators marched through the city centre under a giant model shark. Banners read “against rent sharks and speculators”.“We have had very bad experiences with these property companies for years, and we know that they answer to their shareholders and not to tenants. We don’t want them in our city any more,” organiser Rouzbeh Taheri told Reuters television.For decades after unification in 1990, Berlin became a magnet for artists, musicians and students drawn by housing that was far cheaper than in other major European cities.Around 85% of Berliners rent their homes rather than own them.But with an influx of some 40,000 people a year in the last decade, rents have more than doubled since 2008, according to a study by online housing portal immowelt.de. The city is no longer a bargain for newcomers, and many of its longer-term residents say they are struggling.Among the properties that have been sold off to the private sector are many of the large landmark Communist-era housing projects built as showpieces under the former East Germany. Many have been acquired in recent years by Deutsche Wohnen, the city’s largest landlord with around 115,000 flats.Campaigners, who call their movement “expropriate Deutsche Wohnen”, have six months to gather 20,000 signatures and until February to collect a further 170,000 to force a referendum. A February poll showed 44 percent of Berliners support renationalising flats, while 39% oppose it.Deutsche Wohnen and other landlords say the spectre of expropriation could exacerbate the problem by deterring new construction: “Expropriation brings no relief for the drastically tight housing market in the capital,” said Deutsche Wohnen chief executive Michael Zahn. — Reuters"

Epsilon has also attracted a joint offer from Advent International and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, people familiar with the matter said last week. Alliance may select a winner as early as this week in an auction that could fetch about US$5bil, the people said.
A takeover would bring Publicis more online data-mining expertise to help clients target shoppers more effectively and reduce its reliance on conventional advertising, which is in decline as consumers turn away from newspapers and traditional TV. Publicis shares fell the most in seven weeks as investors questioned its ability to integrate the business.
The share drop “reflects a lack of confidence in the ability of the ad-agency groups to make big M&A work,” said Matthew Bloxham, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Publicis chief executive officer Arthur Sadoun has poured resources into what he calls “strategic game changers,” businesses that make better use of data and devise creative digital offerings for clients. It already made one of the industry’s boldest bets on ad technology in 2015 with the US$3.7bil purchase of Boston-based Sapient.
There have been missteps along the way, with the group posting a loss in 2016 after writing down the value of one of its digital businesses.
Epsilon uses data to help its clients customize advertisements to their customers. Its services span from loyalty programmes to email marketing and its digital arm, Conversant, collects consumer data including transactions, location and web activity. Alliance Data said in February it was weighing preliminary offers for the unit after announcing a review in November.

The question is whether policy makers are still clinging to hopes of stabilization, or if optimism has completely faded. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has hinted at the latter, saying the world is in a “precarious” position.“The IMF meetings take place against the backdrop of elevated uncertainty,” said Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg Economics. “Our global GDP tracker is flagging the weakest growth since the financial crisis. The Fed pause, trade truce, and China stimulus, though, mean policy is now more supportive. We think the bottom for 2019 growth is either now or soon.”In January, the IMF made particularly dramatic downgrades to euro-area forecasts.

The jobs data are showing wage pressures intensifying relative to earlier in the current economic cycle. Upcoming releases on inflation, including CPI, PPI, import prices and inflation expectations will help to provide context on the degree to which labor costs are finally passing through the production pipeline,” said, Carl Riccadonna, Bloomberg chief US economist.> AsiaUnder the cloud of the US-China negotiations, Asia’s data such as South Korean jobs, Japanese machine tool orders and Taiwanese exports will be scrutinised for clues as to how regional economies are faring amid the uncertainty.

It is a huge market in China, he says. The market value of LED lighting to be used for passenger cars in China is projected to hit US$1.9bil in 2022.
According to Lim, the group will soon invest RM3.2mil on machinery to expand its production capacity.
“Without an expanded capacity, we won’t be able to tap into the automotive market in China nor increase our market penetration in the country, which is about 3% in the electronic packaging and interconnect solutions industry,” he says.
Amlex is also working on the miniaturisation of lead-frames used in smartphones and IoT products.
“We are now designing the 0.004-inch lead-frames for the new generation of smartphones and IoT devices using more sensors, which also requires more lead frames.
“We have a RM4mil budget for our design and development activities,” he adds.
The company is also investing in insert moulding, which is a cost-saving production technology process. Insert moulding differs from injection moulding, says Lim, in that it is used to enhance the physical qualities of the housing.
“The process is used mainly to manufacture housing for sensors requiring stronger protection,” he explains. 
According to Lim, the smartphone market will also be one of the key drivers for the company’s growth in 2019.
“Although the worldwide smartphone shipments are expected to decline by 3% in 2018 before returning to low single-digit growth in 2019 and through 2022, we are confident that our smartphone segment will grow because of the new models planned for release in the third quarter.
“In 2018, all the big players have further built out their portfolios with bigger screens and higher-end smartphones, including Apple’s new launch in September.
“In the third quarter of 2018, the 6-inch to less than 7-inch screen size band became the most prominent band for the first time with more than four times year-over-year growth,” Lim says.
According to research firm IDC, the larger-screen smartphones (5.5 inches and above) will lead the charge with volumes of 947.1 million in 2018, accounting for 66.7% of all smartphones, up from 623.3 million units and 42.5% share in 2017. 
“By 2022, shipments of these larger-screen smartphones will move up to 1.38 billion units or 87.7% of overall shipment volume,” the report says.
“This trend will continue in 2019,” Lim adds."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/08/india-needs-its-own-canary-wharf/,India needs its own Canary Wharf,Economy,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"Even as India is consumed by its upcoming elections, the world’s biggest, the country is nearing another milestone: It’s set to overtake the UK to become the world’s fifth largest economy.
By 2030, its GDP could top US$10 trillion.
Yet, unusually for such a geographically large and economically vibrant country, India has no states to compare to California in the US, China’s Guangdong province or Japan’s Kanto prefecture -- all regions with US$1 trillion economies. 
Nor does it have a city on par with New York or Tokyo, both of which boast bigger economies than countries such as Canada and Indonesia, accounting for over a tenth of national GDP apiece.
India’s next leader will have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change that by transforming the country’s commercial capital, Mumbai. A better one might never come along.
Mumbai is the engine of the prosperous western state of Maharashtra, India’s largest regional economy with a GDP somewhere between US$350-400bil; the city contributes well over half the total. For Maharashtra to become a US$1 trillion economy, Mumbai would need to double or triple the size of its economy, on the back of its preeminent role in service industries, especially finance. That means competing with the likes of Singapore and Shanghai to attract global banks and other world-class financial institutions to the humid, traffic-choked city.
This poses obvious challenges. It’ll require regulatory changes, in particular ending the uncertainty and complexity around taxation for financial services firms, which has led to the bulk of the local fund-management industry moving to Singapore. Maharashtra will also have to establish a first-rate system for resolving commercial disputes, involving everything from fast-track courts to international arbitration.
Just as importantly, the chaotic city needs to create an efficient core - a business district attractive enough for leading global businesses to want to locate there. Dense urban clusters create agglomeration benefits, one of the very few ways available to improve productivity permanently.
This is, to say the least, hard to imagine. However much residents love Mumbai’s freewheeling, cosmopolitan spirit, the city is an infrastructural mess. Headlong growth has worsened congestion, air pollution and the general quality of life. Urban planning is mostly an afterthought. Haphazard development and an explosion in car ownership has made parts of the cramped city virtually unnavigable during rush hour, when the average commute from the airport to downtown Mumbai can take over 1.5 hours.
However, Mumbai has a unique opportunity to turn its fortunes around. The city’s port, which occupies about 900 ha along the prime eastern waterfront, is slowly vacating the area because shipping and allied activities have moved elsewhere. Redevelopment plans so far have focused on infrastructure, including a cruise ship terminal. The area could be something much bigger: a means to transform Mumbai into a financial powerhouse on par with Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Remember that the City of London occupies only 290 ha. Canary Wharf, London’s new financial district where most major banks are located, is just over 40 ha.
This tiny area hosts financial services firms that provide 160,000 jobs with an average wage in excess of £100,000, while serving as a magnet for other businesses; those 40 ha generate economic output of over US$50bil annually. 
Harvard’s Ed Glaeser shows that the area in midtown Manhattan between 41st and 59th Streets houses 600,000 workers, earning US$100,000 on average. In Asia, the central business district of Singapore is built on 184 ha and the Dubai International Financial Centre on 45 hectares. 
Working with city and state officials, India’s next government should aim to redevelop the port area into an efficient, dense, walkable cluster offering the high quality of life and green spaces lacking in the rest of the city. The experience of reviving the London Docklands shows what’s possible. — Bloomberg"

With Friday's gains, the benchmark S&P 500 has closed higher for seven trading days in a row, its longest winning streak since October 2017.

The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs in March, topping the 180,000 new jobs forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Data for February was revised upward to a gain of 33,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 20,000, the smallest gain since September 2017.

The data provided reassurance two weeks after the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes briefly inverted, in what is commonly viewed as a sign of an oncoming recession.

""The yield curve inversion freaked people out, got them thinking about a recession,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York. ""Data like today's takes that off the table.""

However, wage increases slowed in March, leaving the data broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve's decision to suspend its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy.

A dovish Fed along with hopes for a U.S.-China trade agreement have lifted the S&P 500 to its highest level since Oct. 9, putting the index only 1.3% below its record closing high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.36 points, or 0.15%, to 26,424.99, the S&P 500 gained 13.35 points, or 0.46%, to 2,892.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 46.91 points, or 0.59%, to 7,938.69.

Stocks across the world also got a lift from President Donald Trump's comments on Thursday that Beijing and Washington were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks. Trump later said he would not predict that a deal will be reached.

Next week, corporate earnings will come into greater focus with major U.S. banks scheduled to report quarterly results. Analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to fall year-over-year for the first time since 2016.

On Friday, energy stocks jumped 1.7%, the biggest percentage gain among S&P 500 sectors, as oil prices firmed after the release of the U.S. jobs data and on expectations that conflict in Libya could tighten supply.

Technology stocks rose 0.4%, rebounding from Thursday's decline as shares of Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp rose.

Dow Inc shares helped cap gains on the Dow Industrials. The shares dropped 4.1% as J.P. Morgan started coverage of the company, which was spun off from DowDuPont Inc, with an ""underweight"" rating.

Boeing Co shares dipped 1.0% after UBS cut its price target and said the preliminary report following last month's fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash pointed to MCAS anti-stall software as a contributor to the crash. The software has also been implicated in the fatal crash in October of a Lion Air 737 MAX jet in Indonesia.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 23 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.24 billion shares, compared to the 7.33 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.- Reuters"

The benchmark palm oil contract for June delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was up 0.1 percent at 2,206 ringgit ($540.69) a tonne at the midday break.
It earlier rose to 2,218 ringgit, its highest levels since March 4. 
Palm is also up 4.7 percent so far on-week, in line for a second weekly gain in three weeks. 
A futures trader in Kuala Lumpur said the market, which had been overbought this week, is seeing some corrections now. 
Palm oil futures had gained over 1 percent in its past three trading sessions, as industry players expect March data from industry regulator the Malaysian Palm Oil Board to show a decline in inventory levels. 
Malaysia's palm oil stockpiles are likely to have dropped during March to its lowest mark in five months, according to a Reuters survey, as a hefty jump in exports outpaced production gains.
March inventories are expected to have fallen 6.4 percent from February to 2.85 million tonnes, the lowest since October 2018, while exports are pegged to come in at 1.63 million tonnes, a 23.4 percent rise from the previous month.
The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is scheduled to release March data on April 10.
Malaysian palm oil stockpiles rose to their highest in nearly two decades in December, and last increased unexpectedly in February by 1.3 percent to 3.05 million tonnes. 
In other related oils, Chicago May soybean oil contract was down 0.2 percent.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/ageing-japan-defies-demographics/,Ageing Japan defies demographics,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"JUST returned from a brief trip to Sapporo. Japan’s demographics defies destiny. A year ago, Japan was consigned to economic stagnation and then, contraction with its rapidly ageing population and continuing shrinking fertility rates. Their impact is evident everywhere you go. Don’t see too many kids around; many schools are empty (2,000 primary schools shut in 2016); old people are most visible. By 2040, more than one in three in Japan will be over 65, the highest ratio in the world. These are signs of the time: today’s population is smaller than it was in 2000; already 27% of the population is over 65; 50% is over 50; and deaths have exceeded births. Unemployment is near a 25-year low, at 2.5%. The ratio of job offers per applicant is near its 1963 all- time high of 1.6.A year ago, Japan’s GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter (1Q18), ending eight consecutive quarters of growth – its longest period of uninterrupted growth since 1989. Then, it was the only G-7 nation to start 2018 with a shrinking economy. Then, Japan’s GDP growth was among G-7’s lowest over the past 20 years, coming second only to Italy. Still, Japan’s GDP growth per person of working age is, in fact, the second-best performing G-7 nation, after Germany, over the past 20 years. Despite a shrinking labour force, its economy remains robust. March 2019 OECD forecasts (which downgraded almost every G-20 nation) now expects Japan’s GDP to rise by just 0.8% in 2019 (and 0.7% in 2020), with outcomes still weaker if downside risks materialised (Brexit and Chinese slowdown bringing about negative spillovers). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that ageing could potentially drag down Japan’s average annual GDP growth by one percentage point over the next three decades.Global phenomenonToday, 40 nations have shrinking working-age (15-64 years old) populations, up from only nine in late-1980s. China, Russia and Spain joined recently; Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka soon will. This poses a problem: losing a traditional driver of growth. With fewer workers, nations need to raise productivity even more to keep GDP expanding. The national debt will be borne on fewer shoulders. Fewer people will be around to come up with the sort of innovative ideas that can enrich a nation. Businesses may well loath to invest. In fast-shrinking Japan, even domestic firms focus on foreign markets. The old will weigh more heavily on society, too. The balance between people over 65 and those of working age (old-age dependency ratio) can tip even in countries where the working-age population is growing: just look at Australia or the United Kingdom. But it is likely to deteriorate faster if the ranks of the employable are thinning. In Japan, where young people are getting fewer and lives are long, demographers expect there to be 48 people over the age of 65 for every 100 people of working age in 2020 (just 17 in 1990). Some nations face gentle downward slopes; others are on cliff-edges. Whereas, France is gradually losing the working-age group, China’s will soon plunge – a consequence of its one-child policy. Chinese 15 to 64-year-olds (peaked at just over one billion in 2014) is expected to fall by 19 million between 2015 and 2025; by another 68 million the following decade; and 76 million in the one after that.How to prevent the economic cake from shrinking? Besides raising existing workers’ productivity, I see three policies which can greatly alleviate the effects of a shrinking working-age population: > Encourage more women to do paid work. Female participation in the labour market lags behind men’s in all but three countries worldwide; the gap is especially wide in Greece, Italy, Japan – even South Korea, where 59% of working-age women work, compared with 79% of men; > Tap older workers. Today, Chinese workers typically retire between 50 and 60; but by 2050 about 35% of the population is expected to be over 60. Thanks to generous early-retirement policies, only 41% of Europeans (60-64) are in paid work. Among 65 to 74-year-olds, it’s lower than 10%; and > Lure more migrants in their prime years. The trouble is that nations with the biggest demographic shortfalls are often opposed to immigration. Until recently, Japan viewed immigrants more negatively than any G-20 nations. China has never been a country of immigrants. But it is trying to lure back the ethnic-Chinese diaspora. In theory, every rich country can prise open the demographic trap – if it wants to. It just needs political will.Fertility	Falling fertility rates (number of live births per woman) add to Japan’s woes amid an ageing population. The United Nations’ (UN) best estimate suggests that fertility will fall gradually and lifespans increase, so the world’s population will rise from 7.7 billion today to 11.2 billion by 2100. But UN often underestimates. Data from before the Industrial Revolution are spotty but evidence suggests that a typical woman had seven or more children. By 1960, the global fertility rate had fallen to five. Today, it’s 2.4, only just above the “replacement rate” of 2.1, at which the population remains stable, with each generation replacing itself but no more. Nearly all rich countries have sub-replacement fertility rates: the OECD average is 1.7. It’s 1.44 in Japan; 1.62 in China, 1.77 in the United States and 1.9 in Malaysia. Middle-income countries are close, at 2.3. Only in poor countries is fertility rate still high enough to fuel rapid population growth. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is 4.8; in “heavily indebted poor countries”, 4.9. Pre-Industrial Revolution fertility rates persist only in the poorest parts of the poorest countries. No doubt, the 21st century will be African. In 1990, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 16% of world births. Because African birth rates are so much higher, this proportion has risen to 27% and is expected to hit 37% in 2050. About a decade later, more babies will be born here than in the whole of Asia, including India and China. The danger is not a Malthusian crisis, whereby countries run out of food or farmland at some point in the future. It is true that Africa, although vast, is already a net food importer. But that would be fine if Africans were otherwise productive. The real problem is that too many babies sap economic development and make it harder to lift Africans out of poverty.In the world as a whole, the overall dependency ratio (the share of those under 20 plus those over 65 who are provided for by working age population) stands at 74:100. In sub-Saharan Africa it is a staggering 129:100. Many African countries already struggle to build enough schools and medical clinics for their existing children, let alone the masses to come. The trouble is that the fall in fertility rate is happening much more slowly in Africa than elsewhere. One-half of Nigerians already live in cities, compared with 1/3 of Indians. Yet, Nigeria’s fertility rate is more than double India’s. Overall, the fertility rate in sub-Saharan Africa is dropping about half as quickly as it did in Asia or Latin America when families were the same size. Still, lots of children is regarded as an investment; an insurance policy that pays off. The African proverb sums it up: “A child comes with two hands and only one mouth.” Getting old, but not yet richThe demographic outlook is fuelling fears that most of Asia, including China, are growing old before it gets rich, leaving it with too few workers to cover the cost of keeping its ageing population. China is greying earlier and faster than other countries. In 1970, China’s median age was nearly 10 years younger than US; by 2015, it was older. By 2050, there will be only 1.3 workers for each retiree, compared with 2.8 now. It’s about the same level in US now, and 2.2 workers for every retiree by 2035. China’s overall population is expected to start declining in 2030, after peaking at 1.44 billion. Like China, Vietnam is also greying fast, even though its medium age is only 26. Over-60s make up 12% of the population, a share that is forecast to jump to 21% by 2040, one of the quickest increases in the world. That is partly because life expectancy has increased from 60 years in 1970 to 76 today, thanks to rising incomes. Growing prosperity has also helped bring down the fertility rate in the same period from seven children per woman to less than two. Demography is changing in similar ways in many Asian countries. But in Vietnam it is happening while the country is still poor. When the share of the population of working-age climbed to its highest in South Korea and Japan, annual GDP per person (in real terms, adjusted for purchasing power) stood at US$32,000 and US$31,700 respectively. Even China managed to reach US$9,500. In Vietnam, which hit the same peak in 2013, income averaged a mere US$5,000. Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to reach the turning-point in the next few decades, with an income level several times higher than Vietnam’s. Many countries in Asia are ageing fast. But growing old before it becomes rich makes Vietnam’s problems all the more difficult to resolve.Ceiling on ageHumans aren’t built to last forever. How long is life? In 2016, a team of scientists reported the upper limit to be 115 years. But in June 2018, researchers reviewing death rates among elderly Italians suggested that there may be no limit at all. Of late, scientists are reported to have identified the four cellular and molecular processes causing deteriorating old age, viz. chronic inflammation; cell dysfunction; changes in stem cells that make them fail to regenerate tissue; and cellular senescence, the accumulation in tissue of ageing cells that accompanies disease. Healthy young people have few of these ageing cells. But after age 60, they begin to accumulate, and their increasing quantity correlates with disabilities of old age. Scientists now agree that there is possibly an upper limit to how long we can live – about 85 years. Parts of the body, including the brain, are not designed for long-term use. The consequences of pushing the limits of survival: rise of Alzheimer’s disease, dementias, joint and hip problems, loss of muscle mass. In my view, these are not the consequences of failure. Rather of success in extending “health span, not life span”. Japan is very clearly at the global forefront of ageing. Its population has peaked out. It’s now shrinking. The 2016 book: The 100-Year Life was a huge best seller. Its central thesis: individuals, institutions, government, finances and infrastructure need urgent preparation for a time when millions can reasonably expect to live for a century. The consequences: Young Japanese may husband their yen carefully; but seniors are spending more on meat, cars, smartphones and package tours. Brokers have even identified three related “buy” calls: companies that run nursing homes or dispatch caregivers; manufacturers of robots to help or replace Japan’s greying workforce and fitness centres that focus on gym fanatics in their latter decades. Japan’s embrace of the 100-year life has become the call of the century. It is likely that half the children born today will live beyond 100. Fifty years ago, Japan had just 327 centenarians; in 2017 it had 67,824, and the largest per capita ratio in the world. The facts: 107 (age expected to be reached by 50% of Japanese born in 2007); 3.36 million (Japanese men and women aged over 69 who were still working in 2016); 40% (senior employees who say they want to work as long as they can). So, people are working much later into their lives. They remain in better health, continue to gain skills, and invest for a long stay on earth. This optimism is already making its mark in one fundamental area of Japanese life – its “slash and burn” housing market. People today want homes that are built with much longer potential lifespans of up to at least 50 years (instead of 30 years), use more durable materials, and with designs that allow the interiors to be easily converted to make them easier to live-in when they are older. It also foresees the mass ageing of Japan’s construction workforce. Hence, the need to seriously innovate: labour-saving construction techniques, and house designs that can be easily upgraded by elderly renovators.What then are we to do The puzzle: what to do about older men? It’s an issue that age discrimination laws make it harder to ease them out. Many have 20 or more active years ahead. They have no wish to spend the rest of their lives gardening or pottering around the house. While this is today a gender issue, it will in time become a generational one. The women who are now moving into their rightful places in the organisational hierarchy will soon grow older. Many of them have the same desire to continue to engage in meaningful work. While the gender pay gap may narrow as women rise through the ranks, company costs will continue to grow as high-paid staff either decide to stay, or feel they have no choice but to carry on. Younger employees will look at senior colleagues who are much older and wonder how long they will have to wait to reach the top.What can companies do? They can test the age discrimination laws by pushing older workers out. This is too drastic. Companies have ways of making it clear that your time is up. This is common. But legally risky. Or companies can start thinking creatively. While older workers may not want to retire, they may welcome a shorter week. It is a win-win solution: leaving experienced employees in the workplace (with more leisure), while reducing costs. Another option includes offering older employees consulting contracts with the company if they leave. Once again, this keeps them working, cuts the overall salary bill, and opens up promotion prospects for younger staff. But this should not be left just to employers. Older workers can take the initiative. It is wrong to generalise about an entire generation. We all have our own skills, and ones we can readily pick up. Some may have given up learning. Most have not.

Adobe Sensei activates AI and machine learning features across all Adobe products to dramatically improve the design and delivery of digital experiences, drive real-time decision making and accelerate tasks and workflows.In the Adobe Summit 2019, the California-based company unveiled its next-generation Adobe Sensei, which makes the AI and machine learning capabilities widely accessible to any business, including to those that lack or only have limited data science resources.Now in the 37th year since its establishment, Adobe is more than just Photoshop.The company’s products have expanded widely and are mainly classified into three groupings, namely the Creative Cloud, Experience Cloud and Document Cloud.The Creative Cloud offers Adobe’s clients apps and services for video, design, photography and the web. Among the products under the cloud are Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Lightroom.The Experience Cloud comprises solutions for marketing, analytics, advertising and commerce, with products such as Audience Manager, Experience Manager and Analytics. According to Adobe, the solutions under the Experience Cloud are “all integrated on a cloud platform for a single experience system of record”.Meanwhile, the Document Cloud consists of the commonly-used Adobe Acrobat as well as Adobe Sign.Adobe posted a strong financial performance in the financial year ended Nov 30, 2018 (FY18), as the company made significant investments across its product portfolio, entered new markets and made strategic acquisitions.Its revenue hit an all-time-high revenue of US$9.03bil in FY18, which represents a 24% year-on-year growth, surpassing earlier forecast. Adobe envisions the positive momentum to continue, with stronger financial results in FY19. In an exclusive interview with StarBizweek, Adobe executive vice-president and general manager of digital media Bryan Lamkin (pic) says the IT company plans to diversify its product offerings within its existing segments.“If you look at the Experience Cloud, we are clearly betting big on business-to-business and commerce-related solutions and products. For the Document Cloud, we are focusing a lot of our energy on collaboration and on mobile.“Meanwhile, under the Creative Cloud, we still have work to do in providing application offerings on our key services. We are also investing in screen or experience design, where we have our new product Adobe XD to allow our clients to design and prototype user experience for web and mobile apps.“Augmented Reality (AR) is also another area of investment. “We are not going to become a 3D modelling company but we can adjust 3D models and make them photo-realistic for AR experience or even video,” he says.Currently, Lamkin guides Adobe’s Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses.Over the years, Lamkin points out that Adobe’s capital expenditure trend has skewed more towards research and product development compared to distribution and manufacturing. This is largely due to the greater digitalisation of its products, from selling software items in boxes to offering them for sale online.Adobe’s continued innovation and unique product offerings compared to other industry rivals are the key factors that have made the company appealing to its clients, says Lamkin.“Not only our revenue, but also our customer base has expanded dramatically over the years.

She’s tried to forestall this by asking the experts to identify problems and recommend whether the EU’s competition law tools need to be updated.Any decisions on changes are likely to rest with her successor after she is due to step down later this year.“We may need to step in if powerful companies are trying to make it harder for people to multi-home” by using multiple services at the same time, Vestager told a gathering of smaller European competition authorities in Bucharest, Romania. Regulators “will have to stay alert to new ways companies can use their power to drive out competition” and shut down opportunities for others.While the EU closed its last big tech probe with a third fine for Google last month, Vestager told reporters she was hoping to move forward with an Amazon.com Inc investigation before her term is due to end.The next step would likely be the start of a formal investigation that could eventually lead to a fine or an order to change behavior.The report urges enforcers to remain skeptical of big tech firms, saying they “may want to err on the side of disallowing potentially anti-competitive conducts” and require such firms to show any benefits. That’s especially the case where a company is trying to expand into new markets “growing into digital ecosystems, which become ever more difficult for users to leave.” Strategies that lock in customers should be forbidden if there aren’t clear consumer advantages.“Requiring dominant players to ensure data interoperability may be an attractive and efficient alternative to calling for the break-up of firms” which would allow consumers benefit from the variety of services offered by big companies, the report says.Data protection rules don’t prevent powerful firms from being mandated to allow users’ data to be moved from rivals, the experts said. “more stringent data portability.” Orders to share data access or data interoperability “may need to be imposed” under strict terms if a firm isn’t aiding rivals providing complementary services, like after-sales. The report doesn’t call for changes in how the EU handles mergers despite officials’ concerns that their revenue thresholds for filings miss deals where target firms make no money, such as Facebook’s takeover of WhatsApp.  They do call for extra scrutiny of deals that might allow a technology platform take over an emerging mini-rival . — Bloomberg"

The abundance of online job platforms has made it easier for people to freelance and carve out their income in the gig economy.

It is no secret that traditional models have been disrupted by the gig economy. 
Millennials are becoming increasingly drawn to the gig economy lifestyle, which is all about freelance gigs and short-term jobs where “giggers” are free to choose where, when and how they work. 
The so-called “gig economy” term came into the employment vocabulary only recently and has become the catchphrase for everyone from Grab drivers to freelance professionals.

 
It was reported by McKinsey & Company in its “A labour market that works: Connecting talent with opportunity in the digital age” report that the gig economy could add US$2.7 trillion per year or 2% to the global economy in 2025. 
In Malaysia, according to the World Bank data, about 26% of the Malaysian workforce are freelancers and that the number is growing, as more people are opting for more flexible working hours. 
While the gig economy is expected to continue to grow, businesses and governments are scratching their heads to grasp the long-term impact of this kind of jobs. 
Some gig economy organisations, especially ride-sharing and food-delivery services, have raised public concerns on skills and retirement plans. 
It is worth noting that although the gig economy freelancers are offered independence and flexibility in working hours, they are not entitled to company-sponsored retirement.
As the gig economy matures and finds its place alongside more traditional companies, some argue that the gig economy or freelancing will not replace traditional jobs."

Optimism that Washington and Beijing are approaching a trade deal also boosted crude prices.

Brent crude futures settled at $70.34 a barrel, up 94 cents, or 1.35 percent. The session high of $70.46 was the strongest since Nov. 12.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $63.08 a barrel, up 98 cents, or 1.58 percent. Earlier in the session, WTI hit $63.24, the highest since Nov. 6.

Brent recorded its second straight week of gains, while WTI saw its fifth consecutive weekly rise.

The U.S. Labor Department report showed employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March.

""This data is going to be enough to keep us above the $60 level for a least a couple of weeks,"" said Josh Graves, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.

Military action in Libya, which could disrupt supply from the OPEC member, also aided prices.

On Thursday, Eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops to march on Tripoli, escalating a conflict with the internationally recognised government.

""The developing situation in Libya is also supportive, but, for now the oil is continuing to flow and will likely continue to do so,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

Crude futures also received a boost from news of a potential slowdown in crude production out of Venezuela, as U.S. sanctions and energy blackouts hit the OPEC nation's oil industry.

Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA expects its crude upgraders to operate well below capacity this month, according to industry sources and documents seen by Reuters.

Venezuela depends on the upgraders to convert the extra-heavy crude oil produced in the Orinoco Belt into exportable grades usable in overseas refineries.

U.S. energy companies this week increased the number of oil drilling rigs for first time in seven weeks, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday. [RIG/U] Companies added 15 oil rigs in the week to April 5.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/five-big-themes-likely-to-dominate-thinking-of-investors-and-traders-in-the-coming-week/,Five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week,Markets,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",7:13 AM MYT,"LONDON: Following are the five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week:

1/ THE I WORD

As the U.S. yield curve makes up its mind whether to invert or not, investors seeking reassurance that we are in a Goldilocks era of non-inflationary growth will get to scour two monthly price gauges this week.

On Wednesday, the Labor Department is expected to report that its March Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent on the month and 1.8 percent over the year - a reading that would reinforce subdued underlying inflation and validate the Fed's almost about-face after four hikes last year.

CPI - a proxy for overall inflation that factors into cost of living adjustments for Social Security - rose 1.5 percent year to February, the smallest increase since September 2016. The latest reading of the Fed's favourite inflation measure rose 1.8 percent in the year to January, below its 2 percent target.

Fed officials have started alluding to a new economic reality of slowish growth and little upward price pressure. Even as wages creep higher, improved productivity curbs firms' costs.

Minutes of the March Fed policy meeting, to be released on Wednesday, will be cross checked for references to the new ""patient"" approach and ""muted"" inflation. The March producer price index, a glimpse of pipeline price pressures, is scheduled for Thursday.

2/ MARIO TO THE RESCUE

Just a month since the European Central Bank put plans to normalise policy on hold and delayed a rate hike into 2020, further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors puts the spotlight back on the central bank.

A woeful set of German industrial orders data this week pushed German Bund yields back into negative territory and though a U.S.-China trade deal could be in sight, it looks like difficult times ahead for Europe.

No policy changes are expected at Wednesday's ECB meeting, especially since some board members are travelling to Washington for the International Monetary Fund's spring meetings.

But talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks, global recession fears, Brexit, and a sense of panic that has pushed 10-year German bond yields back below zero percent, all suggest ECB chief Mario Draghi's news conference may prove lively.

Investors will also keep an eye out for further details on cheap loans known as the targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) -- one of the few policy tools left in the kit after the end of QE -- and what the ECB will do to incentivise banks to take it up.

3/ WATCH YOUR CHINA

An unexpected recovery in China factory activity surveys offered investors a glimmer of hope the stimulus injected in one of the world's major growth engines may be yielding results.

Trade data due out on Friday could provide the next clue that could help investors regain confidence as they gauge whether the slowdown is bottoming out.

That said, the recovery remains feeble and analysts believe it is still highly-dependent on how the trade negotiations with Washington go.

Markets took some hope from an announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday that Washington and Beijing could announce a trade deal within four weeks while Chinese President Xi Jinping was reported as saying progress was being made. But Trump also warned Beijing it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact.

Many believe the Chinese economy may still need more stimulus either way. Looking at the pattern of past decisions by the People's Bank of China, a decision to cut bank reserve requirements may be announced by mid-April, economists say.

4/ THE LONG GOODBYE

After British Prime Minister Theresa May's request to the European Council to delay Brexit until up to June 30, focus now shifts to a meeting next week where EU leaders will discuss a proposal to offer Britain a flexible extension of up to a year.

After the British parliament failed to approve a withdrawal agreement, May started talks this week with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the hope of breaking the Brexit deadlock, but markets are not getting too excited about it.

While one-month risk reversals for the pound, a gauge of demand for the British currency in the derivatives market, have rebounded from a 2-1/2 year low hit last month, they still remained far below levels seen earlier this year, indicating overall sentiment remained bearish.

Implied volatility measures also indicated caution with one-month gauges for the pound remaining elevated despite a dip this week compared to the euro and the Japanese yen.

5/ IS IT SPRING YET?

It is that time of year, when central bank governors, finance ministers, policy makers and investors from around the globe gather in Washington for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. A Group of 20 central bankers and finance ministers meeting takes place on the sidelines.

There is no shortage of topics to talk about. Concerns over the health of the global economy amid trade wars and other political uncertainties such as Brexit have sent jitters through markets.

Major central banks' efforts to navigate their way back to normal after years of low interest rates and easy money following the 2008 financial crisis have not been without bumps. Central bank independence has been questioned in many countries.

Speaking in the run up to the gathering of the great and good of policy making and finance, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has called the outlook for growth ""precarious"" and warned that years of high public debt and low interest rates over the past decade have left many countries with limited room to act when the next downturn arrives. - Reuters"

Government and corporate bonds with a total value of $17 billion at the end of 2018 would be affected, according to a Reuters calculation based on fund data.

These are issued by Chile ($362 million), the Czech Republic ($50 million), Hungary ($63 million), Israel ($117 million), Malaysia ($1.9 billion), Mexico ($5.7 billion), Poland ($1.05 billion), Russia ($1.2 billion), South Korea ($6.3 billion) and Thailand ($241 million), the ministry said in a statement listing the countries, with the amounts taken from fund data.

""Along with certain adjustments to the country weightings for government bonds, the changes proposed will facilitate lower transaction costs in the management of the Fund,"" it added.

The fund will still be able to buy emerging market bonds if fund managers want to actively invest in them, rather than passively tracking the benchmark index, although such paper would be capped at five percent of the fixed-income portfolio.

The Norwegian wealth fund, currently worth $1.05 trillion, invests around 30 percent of its assets in fixed income. The 70 percent invested in equities was not affected by the decision.

In 2017, the central bank, which manages the fund, proposed cutting 20 currencies from the fixed-income benchmark, leaving only U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds.

Friday's decision means Danish, Swedish, Swiss, Japanese, Canadian and Australian bonds will remain part of the benchmark, as will those of Singapore, New Zealand and Hong Kong.

The proposals must be agreed by parliament, but as the Norwegian government holds a majority, the white paper is expected to be passed in June.

WIND FARMS, SOLAR FARMS

The fund's present mandate for renewable investments will double in value to 120 billion crowns ($14 billion), the ministry said, allowing investment in unlisted renewable infrastructure projects, such as wind or solar farms - something long demanded by environmental groups.

""Finally the government is...letting the oil fund invest in projects that can supply the world with green renewable energy,"" said Else Hendel, interim policy director at WWF-Norway.

Hendel said the new mandate represented only 1.3 percent of the present value of the fund. ""It is a start but Parliament should increase it further,"" she said.

The ministry also proposed tightening its rules for excluding from its investments companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from thermal coal.

It appointed a committee to review the fund's ethical guidelines. The fund cannot, for instance, invest in companies that produce tobacco, nuclear weapons and cluster munitions.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/boeing-cuts-737-max-output-in-wake-of-two-deadly-crashes/,Boeing cuts 737 MAX output in wake of two deadly crashes,Airlines,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",10:14 AM MYT,"CHICAGO/SEATTLE: Boeing Co said on Friday it plans to cut its monthly 737 aircraft production by nearly 20 percent in the wake of two deadly crashes, signaling it does not expect aviation authorities to allow the plane back in the air anytime soon.

Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after a global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10, killing all 157 people onboard.

Production will be cut to 42 airplanes per month from 52 starting mid-April, the company said in a statement, without giving an end-date.

U.S. and airline officials said they now believe the plane could be grounded for at least two months, but an even longer grounding is a serious possibility.

The crash in Ethiopia and the crash of a Lion Air plane in Indonesia last October that killed all 189 people on board have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis.

Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday the company now knows that a chain of events caused both disasters, with erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software ""a common link"" between the two.

Boeing said it would not reduce jobs at the new production rate and will work to minimize the financial impact.

The company's board will establish a committee to review how the company designs and develops airplanes, Muilenburg said. The group will ""recommend improvements to our policies and procedures"" for its 737 MAX and other airplane programs.

Boeing said it continues to make progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents.

Shares in Boeing Co fell around two percent after the market closed on Friday. While the number of 737 MAX planes grounded is just over 370, nearly 5,000 more are on order.

Boeing faces logistical issues in finding places to park the growing number of planes as well as being responsible for all their maintenance costs since it has been unable to deliver the jets to customers, two people briefed on the situation said.

Manufacturers avoid halting and then resuming production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. Boeing had been planning to speed up production in June to 57 a month.

Having to hold planes in storage without delivering them does, however, consume extra cash through increased inventory.

Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems Holdings said it will continue to make 52 737 MAX shipsets - the complete set of parts for each aircraft - per month, storing extras at its facilities. Its shares fell 3.5 percent.

National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that U.S. investigators were given the raw data from Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 as soon as it was read in France last month. He added that the Ethiopian Airlines 302 preliminary report ""was very thorough and well done.""

Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart was named by the Federal Aviation Administration this week to head an international team to review the safety of the 737 MAX.

He told reporters on Friday he thought the review, which will start on Monday, could take about three months. It is still not clear what countries will take part.

He said investigators are going to be focused far more on the interaction between software and pilots than mechanical issues in future.

""This is territory we are going to see more of,"" Hart said. - Reuters"

Jet, India's oldest private carrier, is saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, compounding its financial woes and forcing it to ground most of its fleet.

After Jet failed to convince potential investors, including its largest shareholder Etihad Airways, to bail it out, Indian banks decided to take a majority stake in the carrier.

Last month, Jet's lenders, led by State Bank of India agreed to bailout the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a majority stake, while seeking out an investor to help revive the company's fortunes.

Jet's lenders on Thursday said they plan to seek expressions of interest in the airline from potential investors from April 6 and that all submissions from interested parties are expected to be completed by April 9.

But this process may be delayed as the Reserve Bank of India is yet to examine the issue of debt to equity conversion, the paper said, citing a source.

Chinese reserves, the world's largest, rose by nearly $9 billion in March to $3.099 trillion, its highest since August last year, central bank data showed on Sunday.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would rise $5 billion to $3.095 trillion.

""The U.S. dollar index strengthened slightly in March due to China-U.S. trade talks, the revised policy outlooks of central banks in Europe and America as well as uncertainty over Brexit...China's forex reserves expanded marginally,"" China's forex regulator said after the data release.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) added that with the economy expected to maintain reasonable growth and improved flexibility in the yuan exchange rate, the country's forex reserves will remain stable.

The yuan fell 5.3 percent against the dollar last year as trade relations with the United States deteriorated and the Chinese economy slowed. But it has rebounded over 2 percent so far in 2019 on hopes Washington and Beijing will reach an agreement to end their bruising trade war

In March, the yuan fell 0.3 percent against the dollar due to the strength of the greenback. The dollar was up 1 percent against a basket of major currencies.

U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their latest round of trade talks on Friday and were scheduled to resume discussions this week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit-for-tat tariff battle that has roiled global markets.

But the outlook for the dollar is expected to remain soft after the Federal Reserve last month abandoned projections for further interest rate hikes this year on signs of an economic slowdown in the United States.

Assuming continued dollar weakness and progress in trade talks, the yuan will likely hold on to its recent gains and appreciate modestly over the coming year, according to analysts in a new Reuters poll. It last traded around 6.72 to the dollar.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a trade deal could be announced in the next four weeks. But the U.S. trade office said on Saturday that significant work remains to be done. Discussions are set to resume this week.

The value of China's gold reserves fell slightly to $78.525 billion from $79.498 billion at the end of February.

REVERSAL OF FORTUNES?

For much of last year, global investors worried about the risk of capital flight from China as the economy cooled, and debated how much yuan weakness Beijing would allow, though strict capital controls kept outflows in check.

More recently, with the dollar on the backfoot, attention has turned to how much upward pressure Chinese policymakers will be comfortable with, as foreign inflows into the country's financial markets look set to boost the currency.

Chinese stocks have rallied more than 20 percent this year on trade deal hopes, while some Chinese bonds were added on April 1 to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, one of the most widely tracked fixed income benchmarks.

UBS Asset Management estimated this phase of bond inclusion will introduce $250-$500 billion of passive money alone, and possibly trillions of dollars if active money is counted.

The tide may also be turning for China's economy, with business surveys showing March manufacturing activity returned to growth, suggesting months of government stimulus measures are starting to take hold.

If sustained, improving economic data could prompt markets to scale back expectations of further policy easing, though analysts still expect several more cuts in banks' reserve requirements this year, possibly as soon as next week. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/07/time-ticking-down-for-britain-to-come-to-brexit-deal/,Time ticking down for Britain to come to Brexit deal,Economy,"Sunday, 7 Apr 2019",7:51 PM MYT,"LONDON: Britain's government held out the possibility of compromise on Sunday with the opposition Labour Party to try to win support in parliament for leaving the European Union with a deal, just days before the latest Brexit date.

Prime Minister Theresa May, weaker than ever after her Brexit deal was rejected by parliament three times, has been forced to turn to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after giving up on winning over eurosceptics in her Conservative Party, whose opposition has hardened.

With Britain's departure now set for April 12, May's government is running out of time to get a deal through Britain's divided parliament, and must come up with a new plan to secure a new delay from EU leaders at a summit on Wednesday.

Britain's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years is mired in uncertainty, with ministers saying Brexit may never happen, businesses worried the country could leave without a deal, and others just wanting to reverse it.

In a last-ditch bid to get her deal through parliament, May opened talks with Corbyn last week to try to strike a deal on Britain's future ties with the EU in exchange for his support for her divorce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement.

So far those talks have failed to yield any kind of accord, with Labour policy chiefs saying the government has yet to move from its ""red lines"", above all over a customs union, which sets tariffs for goods imported into the EU.

""Specifically provided we are leaving the European Union then it is important that we compromise, that's what this is about and it is through gritted teeth,"" said Andrea Leadsom, the Brexit-supporting leader of the House of Commons (lower house of parliament).

""But nevertheless the most important thing is to actually leave the EU,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show, adding that May's proposal for a customs arrangement after Brexit was not too far from Labour's desire for a customs union.

But, while describing the talks so far as positive, Labour's business policy chief Rebecca Long-Bailey said there had as yet been no ""real changes"" to the deal.

""I think both sides are committed to working quite rigorously to compromise as much as possible so that we can provide that compromise Brexit deal that I think parliament desperately needs at the moment,"" she told the BBC.

Shami Chakrabarti, Labour's legal policy chief, was more blunt. ""It's hard to imagine that we are going to make real progress now without either a general election or a second referendum on any deal she can get over the line in parliament,"" she told Sky News.

RUNNING OUT OF TIME

Britain voted by 52 to 48 percent in 2016 to leave the EU, and parliament, May's cabinet and the country at large remain deeply polarised over the terms of Brexit and even whether to depart at all.

Despite the lack of convergence between the two major parties over a deal, there was one thing they did agree on - time is running out for Brexit to be secured.

May, who has been verbally mauled by members of her own party for turning to Labour, herself warned Brexit-supporting lawmakers that ""the longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all"".

In an attempt to avoid falling out of the EU without a deal, she again heads to Brussels this week to ask for a further delay until June 30 - something EU leaders have said requires her setting out an alternative path to getting her deal approved.

Any extension would require unanimous approval from the other EU countries, all weary of Britain's Brexit indecision, and could come with conditions. EU summit chair Donald Tusk plans to propose an extension of a year, which could be shortened if Britain's parliament eventually ratifies the deal.

But even the threat of losing Brexit has so far failed to change the minds of hardline eurosceptic Conservative lawmakers, and some are now suggesting that Britain make the EU's life a misery if Britain is forced to accept a long delay.

""If we are forced to remain in we must be the most difficult member possible,"" Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group, a Conservative eurosceptic group, told Sky News.

""When the multi-annual financial framework comes forward, if we're still in, this is our one in seven year opportunity to veto the budget and to be really very difficult."" - Reuters"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/eking-its-place-in-the-ports/,Eking its place in the ports,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"IN ALL modesty, Syed Sadiq Obaidi Albar frequently shouts out about Usaha Teknikal Sdn Bhd’s achievement in making a name for itself in the port engineering services space.
“We are proud of the fact that a bumiputra company has been able to establish itself as a key player in engineering services in the port business. And we did it on our own,” says the 44-year-old managing director.
The company was founded by Sadiq and sales director Alizi Ismail in 2008 as a pet project. Both were working in a multinational corporation and needed an avenue to look into clients’ requirements which were not served by their employer.
About three years ago, they left full-time employment and started to actively grow the business.
“We saw an opportunity that was not really served in the port industry. For example, what do port operators do when they are short of cranes, or need to refurbish a crane? Then, they’ll need a temporary arrangement.
“So we bought a crane and offered leasing services so that the port can still serve vessels temporarily while making arrangement for a more permanent investment,” explains Alizi.
Usaha Teknikal mainly operates in four key areas: leasing of equipment, refurbishment and maintenance of port equipment, carrying out automation projects, and research and development. The latter two are relatively new segments for the company.
Going into business was a steep learning curve for the duo. Equipment didn’t come cheap. This means heavy upfront investment and possibly a strained cashflow to finance the equipment.

 
Rail works: Sadiq (left) and Alizi see the potential to branch out into rail engineering services.


Additionally, some equipment take two years to order. So they bought older equipment.
“But we had to make sure that we have the expertise to bring these equipment back to life,” says Sadiq.
Luckily, the banks were supportive.
“That was a critical bit. It was very progressive of the banks (to support us). Otherwise, it would have been a different story. We secured a project, and went to the bank,” recalls Sadiq.
The company got its first contract to lease out a rubber tyred gantry (RTG) crane to Penang Port. And this was the start of its growth story.
Usaha Teknikal moved on from just leasing equipment to refurbishment works. And this is where they see opportunities to expand their expertise.
“These kinds of cranes can last for 25 years. But in eight to 10 years, the control system, the electrical, the system may become obsolete. That’s why there is a strong demand for refurbishment.
“It’s pretty intensive work. After we design the new system and engineering works, we stop the crane for 30-40 days and do the actual work. And you are paying only 20%-30% the cost of a new crane. Some of these cranes cost RM30mil.
“Nowadays, ships are also getting bigger and taller. So port operators also need to heighten the crane to accommodate bigger ships. So there is always a demand for these services,” says Alizi.
 
Next port of call
An opportunity for Usaha Teknikal to expand outside local borders came about two years ago – in Brunei, to be exact.
While it involved equipment leasing at Muara Port, Brunei, there was also an opening for the company to embark on a project that utilises its expertise in equipment refurbishment.
“We initially didn’t want to do those kinds of projects so soon but the opportunity in Brunei just came. And sometimes if you wait, that’s all you end up doing. So we took up the challenge,” Sadiq shares.
But when the company wanted to expand its services there, Sadiq found that local financial institutions were not as supportive of its venture. Regional business was not within their scope, he was told.
With the contract in hand, Usaha Teknikal went ahead and funded the equipment refurbishment project with its own resources, which put a lot of stress on its cashflow.
Fortunately, the company found a lot of favour with its partners and suppliers, which supported them with extended credit terms.
Somehow, the company managed to deliver the project on time.

 
An example: The company’s refurbishment work in Brunei serves as a testament of its capabilities.


“We are proud that we got to manage this internally. Our overseas venture has been good so far. For an engineering company, you would aspire to do projects like this and even more, overseas.
“(Now that it is completed,) we are hungry for more. We can do this and we want to do more. We are engineering guys and our team is excited. They have become very skilled and they are asking us, where to next,” he says.
Its success in Brunei serves as a confidence booster and a case study for Usaha Teknikal as it eyes more projects in the region.
Alizi notes that the local market is rather small in size and the company needs to move beyond to grow. It is currently looking at opportunities in Indonesia and Thailand where the port industry has grown more robust in recent years.
It has taken part in a number of tenders that total up to some RM30mil and Alizi is hopeful it will be able to nab some of them.
Last year, Usaha Teknikal handled projects worth about RM16mil.
Of course, going abroad does add to its challenges given that funding will be difficult as Malaysian banks are not keen on foreign business. Additionally, a lack of local market knowledge may be an obstacle for the company.
Nonetheless, Alizi sees strong demand, particularly for equipment refurbishment, in the region.

“There’s a need out there. There are a lot of older equipment in the region. That’s where we can come in to increase the lifespan of the equipment. One advantage we have is that we have the expertise at the right price. We have the same technical capability as some European companies but our cost is lower. But we need to work hard to deliver,” he says.
The space is, notably, not short of competition. There is a myriad of small and large firms around to provide engineering services to ports.
However, he says there are no strong players in the field yet, which gives Usaha Teknikal an opportunity to differentiate itself from the rest. And having its own fleet of equipment helps.
At the moment, the company’s asset size stands at about RM10mil.
“If we have good funding, we can grow much faster. We can zoom in on an opportunity knowing that funding will be there. I think a lot of companies going out have that challenge,” says Alizi.
The company also sees potential to expand into rail engineering services as more inland areas require connectivity with ports for businesses to grow.
“The rail business is something we want to grow. The engineering is not far from what we are already doing,” notes Sadiq.
But the big dream for Usaha Teknikal, says Alizi, is to someday become a port operator.
“There are big port operators out there, we can be a small operator.
“We have what it takes. We have the experience and the people. When we have accumulated enough assets, knowledge and experience, we should be able to offer that service,” he says.
With more ports being built in the region, he thinks it is not an impossible dream. Indonesia, for example, has ports of different sizes and could offer it an opportunity to start small.
 
Riding on automation
As with other industries, ports are seeing a growing trend in automation. In Malaysia, it is a rather new area, says Sadiq, but in regions such as the Middle East, Europe and Australia, ports are embracing automation.
“We are doing more R&D to see how we can put our know-how into improving equipment, automate and run more efficiently.”
Eventually, cranes will be operated remotely, he notes, with as little human intervention as possible. This will help reduce costs and improve efficiency at the port.
“Take reefer (refrigerated) containers, for example. When they arrive at the port, they get plugged in and someone goes around every few hours to check the temperature. There are thousands of containers in a port and this is currently done manually,” he says.

 
Lengthening lifespans: Port equipment needs to be refurbished and upgraded to cater to bigger ships and new systems.


Automation will enable operators to monitor these containers from afar, help reduce damage to goods and possibly alleviate some disputes and claims should they arise.
Sadiq hopes to be an early mover in the automation space, locally and in the region.
But he acknowledges that reception in the industry has been somewhat lukewarm. There is a looming concern about the cost of technology adoption.
“But technology is becoming more affordable now. And it is the right time now to look into it because of labour shortage and cost pressures,” he says.
“We also hope to develop our own technology. There is more and more technology coming into the market and we will be able to use their platform to develop our own products,” adds Alizi.
The possibilities open to them put them in an optimistic mood. Sadiq believes the company can continue to double in size over the next few years.
“The jobs are there, it is up to us to go out and be competitive. We can’t complain. We just have to keep being hungry,” he says."

“We only obtain the skins after the people in South Africa consume these animals, and many common species are culled by their wildlife department to control their population.
“In South Africa, the skins are often discarded after the animals are harvested for their milk and meat. So I thought, why not put the animal parts to good use?” said the 38-year-old, who owns the interior decor store in Stewart Lane, George Town.
Anoi said the hides were mainly used as pillow cases, cushion covers and carpets as they were extremely durable.
 
 
Anoi says the hides are often turned into pillow cases, cushion covers and carpets.

 
She said the hides of springbok, zebra, reindeer and Nguni cattles were sourced from South Africa and Botswana.
Although frequently misunderstood by tourists and passers-by, Anoi is passionate in the business  as she believes in the cause.
“Many people misjudge us                as being cruel from the moment they walk into our shop, but what they think about us is untrue.
“The animal hides that we source from are not slaughtered for decorative purposes.

“Besides, the skins take longer to degrade compared to plastic, so it    is more practical to use them as functional items,” she said at her shop recently.
Anoi said many might think    that the business was cruel as       the animal hides were sold in the      distinct shapes of the animals with tails and ears intact to the hides most of the time.
“But we only hope that visitors would ask us about the hides before they pass judgement, as it may not be what they think most of the time,” she said."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/08/the-australian-store-that-ships-to-china/,The Australian store that ships to China,SMEBiz,"Monday, 8 Apr 2019",,"AT AN Australia Post store in northern Sydney, there are almost no signs in English, the staff all speak Mandarin and anything bought there must be shipped to China.
The outlet, where shelves are stacked with a2 Milk Co infant formula, Blackmores Ltd vitamin pills, lip balms and Manuka honey, is the latest effort to feed the insatiable demand in China for premium foreign-made goods.
The so-called daigou trade, where people buy products overseas and ship them to the mainland for resale, is showing no signs of slowing down in Australia – even after China’s new e-commerce rules came into force on Jan. 1.
Government-owned Australia Post opened its “concept store” in the suburb of Chatswood just under a year ago on and its success has already spurred a similar venture in downtown Sydney and two in Melbourne. All are located in areas with large Chinese-speaking populations, where private stores catering to the burgeoning daigou trade operate.
For 35-year-old Cathy Wang, who spends an average of A$500 (RM1,455) a week on products at the Australia Post shop, the attraction is milk powder and other calcium products.
They are sold free of Australian goods and services tax, and the size of the packaging available in the store means Wang’s regular shipments typically fall under the level attracting a Chinese import levy.
“I come every day, sending packages to friends,” Wang said. “Because I’ve been here a short time I’m not confident in English. If I go to a local pharmacist and want to know more about the product information, I wouldn’t be able to understand their explanation.”
Wang, who’s studying English at a language school in Sydney, said she doesn’t take a cut from the sales, and her friends in China, especially those with kids, prefer buying milk powder from Australia. That’s a legacy of a major food scandal in China over a decade ago when contaminated infant formula killed at least six babies.
What’s more, Wang says that when she can’t make it to the store – located in the building that was Chatswood’s main post office for 60 years and still carries very similar signage and branding to conventional post offices – she uses the social messaging app WeChat to message staff. They then help package and post her order, before billing her via QR code.
Australia Post says the stores are an example of “finding new ways to give customers what they want while opening opportunities for Australian businesses wanting to connect with the growing Chinese market.” — Bloomberg"

Eventually, they sold the block to Parkway Group, which was already under the control of Khazanah Nasional Bhd, following a lengthy corporate battle.Malvinder and Shivinder focused on Fortis Healthcare Group, which became a target of takeover after it ran into financial distress. In November last year, IHH Healthcare Bhd , which took over the listing from Parkway, acquired a 31.1% stake in Fortis after a bidding process.Under the takeover, IHH has to make an offer for an additional stake of up to 26% in Fortis. Towards this end, IHH even placed a deposit of RM1.97bil with the regulators in India for the exercise that will increase its stake to up to 57.1%.The slew of problems began last year when Daiichi sought a court order through the Delhi High Court to block IHH’s further acquisition of more interest in Fortis.This is in relation to Daiichi’s move to enforce a decision of an arbitration tribunal in Singapore where Malvinder and Shivinder are to pay them 35 billion ruppes (RM2.07bil) in damages.Ranbaxy recorded losses after the sale by the Singh brothers and following a two-year investigation, the US Food and Drug Administration banned 30 drugs made at two Ranbaxy plants due to fabricated test results.This caused Daiichi to severely write down its investment in Ranbaxy.Up until yesterday, Malvinder and Shivinder have yet to settle the amount and the Supreme Court in New Delhi warned the brothers that it will send them behind bars for disobeying the orders to pay Daiichi.In February last year, they were also accused of siphoning 5 billion rupees (RM295mil) cash out of Fortis without board approval.Just a month prior, the brothers were slapped with a lawsuit from an investor, accusing the brothers of siphoning 18 billion rupees (RM1.06bil) from Religare Enterprises Ltd, a financial services firm then owned by them.As if the ongoing drama was not enough, the brothers took their feud public in September last year for alleged “oppression and mismanagement” of their companies.Shivinder accused Malvinder and former Religare Enterprises Ltd chairman Sunil Godhwani as the individuals to be blamed for “a systematic undermining” of the interests of the companies and their shareholders.He then said in a statement that he was disassociating from Malvinder as a business partner and will be pursuing an independent path going forward, adding that he can no longer be party to activities of which transparency and ethics are continuously and consistently negated.In December, Malvinder alleged that his younger brother assaulted him and in February this year, he filed a criminal complaint against Shivinder and several others claiming that they made death threats and committed fraud.Malvinder alleged that Shivinder siphoned funds from the family holding company and diverted them to spiritual guru Gurinder Singh Dhillon of Radha Soami Satsang, hoping that he will one day earn the status of spiritual head.It is quite the irony because Shivinder had once told Forbes in an interview that he once fired people for stealing as little as US$125 (RM507).Fortis, where the Singh brothers placed their dreams to build a global healthcare network, had requested regulators Securities and Exchange Board of India  in February to initiate legal proceedings and to arrest Malvinder and Shivinder to recover 4 billion rupees (RM236mil) that the duo fraudulently siphoned from the company and related entities."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/make-hay-while-the-sun-shines/,Make hay while the sun shines,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"ALMOST five months ago, this column called for the benchmark FBM KLCI to have a fair value of 1,600 points for this year as market’s valuation were then stretched when compared with the regional markets (StarBiz, Dec 8, 2018). The premise of a valuation of 1,600 points for the FBM KLCI was then on the assumption that the index, which traditionally trades at a premium to regional bourses due to its defensive and low beta nature, should trade at about 10% premium to regional averages in the form of forward Price-to-Earnings (PER) ratios. Pegging an anticipated earnings growth of 3.4% for 2019, although consensus forecast was still at high at 6.9%, the FBM KLCI was then valued at 1,600 points based on this year’s earnings. Guess what? On April 1, the FBM KLCI hit a low of 1,628 points, just short of 2% from the expected fair value for the index of 1,600 points envisaged in December last year. Since the new 2019 low early this week, the market has found some breathing space and was last seen at about 1,645 points as of Thursday’s close.What has changed?The first quarter of 2019 which ended last week was one of the best quarters for all asset classes, led by a strong rally in commodities, fixed income, equities and even emerging market currencies. Taking MSCI indices as a yardstick for performance in the quarter, the MSCI REITs was the star performer, rising by 16.3%, followed by MSCI Europe Australasia Far East (EAFE) and MSCI Emerging Market (EM) at 10% and 9.9% respectively. Meanwhile, commodities, measured by Bloomberg Commodity, was up 6.3%, and in the fixed income space, US High Yield was a strong performer, rising by 7.5% followed by both EM Foreign Bonds and Foreign High Yield Bonds at 3.6% each. Even Asian bourses were firmer across the region with gains ranging from 4.8% for the Jakarta Composite Index to 30% for the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index up to Thursday’s close. Only the FBM KLCI was a clear loser – down 2.7% year-to-date as at end of the first quarter. Even bitcoin, which was largely forgotten for the past three months, returned 33% to-date, mostly in the past week itself as the price past the US$5,000 per coin mark.  The euphoria to be “risk-on” was not only brought by disinflation in the US Fed’s move to stay put on its current Fed Fund Rate, reduced tension in the trade war between the United States and China, but sustained economic growth, despite slowing trade and manufacturing output. One cannot deny that the global economy is indeed slowing down but the pace of deceleration looks decent and the fact that we are not falling off the cliff just yet. The disappointment in selected economic data points, especially those related to manufacturing and exports, doesn’t warrant for investors to be utterly bearish as some indicators are still extremely healthy the world over. For example the JP Morgan Global Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). The March reading improved to 53.7 from 53.3 while the US Services PMI, although dipped marginally to 55.3 from 56 in the preceding month, is still a very healthy figure as it was above expectations.  This is an important gauge as services sector makes up bulk of developed economies’ GDP and not manufacturing or exports. For example, for the United States, the services sector accounts close to 80% of the GDP while for the eurozone, that number is 75%, while for China it’s 52%.	With the gains on all markets outside Malaysia, the the Asian bourses PER average, excluding Japan, has now gone up to about 14.4 times for this year’s earnings based on Bloomberg estimates, which makes Malaysia’s FBM KLCI’s current forward PER of 16.3 times at a 13% premium to the region. Question is, is the premium still high or low? Historically, it was very rare for the Malaysian market PER to even trade below 10% premium to the region as most of the time it was seen trading at between 14% to 18%, sometimes even surpassing the 20% mark. Hence, at the current level of 13% premium to Asia ex-Japan, the local bourse looks attractive to investors to start nibbling and to be invested in the market as returns can only be better from hereon. Why?About three weeks ago, Malaysia hosted the 15th edition of Invest Malaysia and in his keynote address, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad gave investors reason to cheer on one condition. The new government needs time to correct the wrongs of the previous administration and at the same time he laid out five key focus areas of the government. These were government’s focus on driving productivity to sustain growth, promoting quality investments, embarking on initiatives for industries to move up the value chain, strengthening our exports as well as fiscal consolidation to ensure sustainability of government’s finances.  The PM, in his address, hit all the right buttons by emphasising that growth of the economy today needs to be driven by digital economy, high-tech and high-wage industries and services. While the government is committed towards ensuring growth, its institutional reform agenda remains on track but of course some of these measures will take time due to constitutional amendments required. His take on educational reforms, shared prosperity and committees that have been set-up to look into the nation’s taxation, debt and liability management, fiscal policy are all long-term initiatives to put the country back on track.  While the PM’s speech did not move market or got investors excited immediately, his message was clear – Malaysia is getting its house in order and the time is now for investors to be benefit and reap the returns of Malaysia’s progress in the future. For foreign investors with interest in the real economy, they seems to have been won over as we saw total approved foreign direct investments (FDIs) in 2018 jumped to RM80.5bil, up 48% y-o-y and at an all time high! What was more interesting is that, the second half of 2018 FDIs more than doubled that of the first half figure of RM26.5bil, suggesting investors were confident after the new government was formed in May of last year. Perhaps the time is now for foreign investors to return to the local bourse, having net sold the market by about RM17bil since May 2018 up to April 4. It is indeed an opportune time to be in the market now and as we will soon be in summer months, although entirely applicable to local investors, what better idioms than to describe the period as a period to “make hay while the sun shines”."

The firm has proposed to buy the superyacht, which was formerly owned by fugitive businessman Jho Low, at a price tag of US$126mil (RM515mil).The market didn’t take the news very well, culminating in more than RM4bil being wiped off the cumulative market value of the three Genting companies listed in Malaysia and Singapore.Meanwhile, analysts are mixed on the half-a-billion-ringgit purchase, despite Genting Malaysia  buying the superyacht at a 51% discount to its previous owner’s purchase price.It is worth noting that Genting Malaysia is sitting on a massive cash pile of close to RM8bil, which means the company would be able to finance the acquisition of the superyacht from its coffers.Despite the strong cash position, the sentiment on the Genting stocks has been on the decline since last year, because investors are concerned about the challenging outlook for the group."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/missed-rally-leads-to-consolidation/,Missed rally leads to consolidation,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"REVIEW: The divergence between Bursa Malaysia and other Asian markets at the start of the week underlined that confidence on the domestic front was found wanting despite previously released economic data that suggested the global slowdown might not be as bad as initially feared.
This was further emphasised by the weakness in the index’s subsequent rebound even as global equities rallied on high hopes for a trade deal between the US and China. 
Bank stocks took a sharp fall on Monday, leading the FBM KLCI lower by nearly 15 points even as key regional indices rose on positive Chinese Purchasing Managers Index data and ahead of the latest round of US-China trade talks.
Lacklustre outlook on the country’s major banks triggered a spate of selling in the stocks that resulted in Public Bank losing nearly 3% and Hong Leong Bank dropping 1.5% in a single session.
In comparison to the ailing FBM KLCI, Asia’s bellwhether indice, the Shanghai Composite Index, surged 2.6% to its highest in 11 months.

While the rebound came on the local market over subsequent days, it  lacked conviction and failed to push the FBM KLCI beyond a technical range.
The index lifted a combined 14.55 points to 1,643.21 over Tuesday and Wednesday as the banking stocks attempted to recoup some losses from the Monday session.  The recovery was seen as tentative compared to the extended advance in other Asian markets.
This was a retracement to the previous Friday’s closing level, which meant the market had missed out on the gains seen in other Asian markets leading up to Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He’s visit to Washington.
Disappointing domestic data did little to help matters as Malaysia’s Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index showed a continued slide in March to a three-month low of 47.2, representing a sixth straight month of contraction since October 2018.
Compounding the general weakness on the index, IHH Healthcare was also seen dragging on the local index. On Tuesday, it fell as much as 34 sen or 6.1% to RM5.23 in intra-day trading, its biggest one-day move in nearly six months as a selloff was triggered by a qualified opinion issued by its external auditor, KPMG. 
There was some excitement as the Genting group stole the spotlight on Wednesday when it announced that it had struck a deal for the purchase of the superyacht Equanimity from the government for US$126mil.
While the purchase was not seen as game-changer to its existing entertainment and hospitality business, share prices of Genting and Genting Malaysia jumped, perhaps on recognition that the move might put the group in the government’s good books.
On Thursday, investors took to the sidelines in a wait-and-see approach as they awaited news over the outcome of the US-China trade negotiations. At market close, the index was up 1.86 points to 1,645.07. 
By yesterday morning, the results of the latest US-China trade negotiations were in. Trump announced that  a “monumental” announcement would be made within weeks and that a resolution was “not very far”, while US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer struck a cautionary tone, saying there were still some major issues left to be resolved.
What seemed evident, however, was that an end-April resolution would not be met.
Sifting through the noise and short of leads from Chinese markets closed for a holiday, the FBM KLCI took to a bearish mood and ended the week softer at 1,641.81.
Statistics: The major index ended the week 1.82 points or 0.1% lower over the previous week, at 1,641.81. Total turnover for the trading week stood at 13.89 billion shares amounting to RM9.58bil compared with 11.74 billion shares worth RM9.13bil over the previous week.
Outlook: The market rebound off a closing low of 1,628 on Monday managed to return it above the 1,640 mark, suggesting that the sharp decline over recent weeks may have halted for now. However, the index continues to move below all the key simple moving averages (SMAs), which indicates downward pressure and a negative outlook.
The FBM KLCI can be seen entering a consolidation phase as it struggles to stay above 1,640. It is expected to move in a sideways direction as investors look to fresh leads for direction.
The mixed results of the technical indicators suggest that the index is caught in indecision.
While the slow-stochastic is showing growing momentum, the 14-day relative strength index is moving in the opposite direction.
The daily moving average convergence/divergence line is headed upward towards the signal line but short of a positive crossing.
The 14-day SMA near the 1,650 level represents a near-term target for the index, a crossing of which would put it on the right footing to rise further towards the crucial target of 1,680, where the 50- and 100-day SMAs have converged.
The December 2018 low of 1,626 serves as support for the index, failing which the index can be seen falling towards 1,609, which proved to be a staunch support during bearish times in 2016."

This lent the opportunity for a reversal and a return to an uptrend. However, a couple of attempts in February and March this year to breach the negative trend line came to no success. It was only over the last two trading sessions that a tentative breach was made, lending hope that the stock would make a break out of its negative posture.
Price action was seen to be mildly positive starting March 19 as the share price was buoyed by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). On Thursday, the stock picked up momentum and crossed above the negative trend line. The share price advance continued yesterday, although at its closing price of RM62, profit-taking could easily see a retreat below the trend line.
To confirm a return of positive sentiment, the share price would have to rise past the immediate resistance at 65 sen, which represents the stock’s recent high and the 200-day SMA, which has remained intact since January 2018. However, even this is not enough to confirm the sustainability of the current uptrend as the stock’s decline over nearly two years gives the daily price chart a decidedly bearish outlook.

A strong crossing of the 70-sen hurdle overhead would be a more convincing breakout, and signal the return of the bulls.
It is a positive development, however, that the current rally is supported by high trading volumes not seen since end-May 2017.
Going by the technical indicators, things are looking positive. The slow-stochastic momentum index has risen to 71 points. This is supported by the 14-day relative strength index in overbought territory at 76 points, which indicates strong momentum.
The daily moving average convergence/divergence line has also picked up considerably sharply from the signal line, which suggests that a positive trend has taken root. 
There is strong support for the share price in the form of the convergence of SMA lines in the 53-55 sen range, suggesting that  in the event of a retreat, this would be a likely pit stop.

And despite operating within the mall, the store owner rarely followed the mall’s operating time and would close the store early whenever he felt like it.This frustrated Amir, who would then have to travel to an alternative store at another mall far from where he lived, just to purchase his supplements. It also did not help that Amir worked long and irregular hours and getting to a mall before it closed proved challenging.Then, one day, Amir decided to look up a local online retail store and discovered that all the supplements and health products he consumed were not only available at the click of a button but they were also cheaper!Subsequently, for the next two years, Amir has been ordering his health products online – hassle free. Amir’s situation is not unheard of. Today, many people are resorting to online shopping mainly because of convenience. With this trend growing, are the days of physical malls numbered?During a presentation at the 12th Malaysian Property Summit 2019 in February, Savills Malaysia head of retail services Murli Menon acknowledged that online retail is creating a structural shift, but added that the bulk of retail sales will still take place in stores.“We’re seeing a return to a customer-centric approach where engagement and convenience is important, but not the channel of purchase.”Murli asserted that physical stores will continue to play an important role in the retail segment.“It’s not a case of brick and mortar versus online. The grocery, beauty, leisure and food and beverage segments are the most defensive to the online migration.”He also noted that many retailers are offering omni-channel execution options to sell their products.“Today, two in three retailers share inventory applications across their store and online channels. Retailers are rapidly moving away from multiple channel-specific commerce platforms, from 66% of retailers in 2011 to 44% currently.“Around 61% of retailers currently use the store as a delivery hub for online orders.”He added that around 57% of retailers currently have store-specific social media initiatives to engage with customers.“Around 64% of retailers plan to increase social media usage to encourage two-way communication with customers, while only 24% provide special customer service based on membership levels.”At its AGM earlier this week, KLCC Property Holdings Bhd (KLCCP) group chief executive officer Datuk Hashim Wahir said the contribution from online retail sales was still minimal in Malaysia.“Online retail sales is just 4% of total retail sales. However, we (KLCCP) are going digital in order to remain competitive.“For example, in KLCC, 80% of our retailers can now use (electronic-payment service) Alipay and people still come to the malls. We’re using the technology to make things more convenient, especially convenience in parking. We have also undertaken cashless initiatives via digital.”KLCCP’s property portfolio includes Suria KLCC, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Kompleks Dayabumi and Menara Maxis. Going forward, Hashim says physical malls will continue to be relevant.“I do believe that in the future, it’s the place that will make a difference. At KLCC, we’re undertaking digital advertising to promote what we are selling at the mall. Our annual footfall is 45 million and 50% is from the LRT and that is the reason also why we’re facilitating the MRT, which will help boost future footfall.“But for us, it’s not just the mall. We also have the park, the Petrosains, the Aquaria and children’s playground, all of which add to the footfall.”Meanwhile, the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) in its research note “The Halo Effect – How Bricks Impact Clicks,” says physical stores are an essential ingredient to the success of retailers.“Opening a new physical store in a market results in an average 37% increase in overall traffic to that retailer’s website, compared with web traffic prior to the store’s opening.”For emerging brands, defined as those less than 10 years old, ICSC says new store openings drive an average 45% increase in web traffic following a store opening. “For comparison, established retailers experience an average 36% boost in web traffic. On average, the share of web traffic increases 27% within a specific market when a new store opens.”Additionally, ICSC says an increase of just 5% in the number of physical stores in a single market has a significant benefit on digital engagement and retail web traffic.“The opposite is also true. Web traffic drops off when retailers close stores. In one retailer’s case, the share of web traffic across the markets where they closed declined up to 77%.“Markets where retailers have stores perform better on brand health metrics (including awareness, consumer perceptions, and willingness to recommend) compared with national benchmarks,” it says."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/ecb-proves-central-bankers-are-bad-capitalists/,ECB proves central bankers are bad capitalists,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"THE global synchronised economy recovery has turned into a global synchronised economic downturn. The outlook seems to be getting bleaker by the day, and major central banks are hinting that they may need to keep monetary policies loose. The European Central Bank (ECB) has even suggested that it could start buying corporate bonds again. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that because it’s becoming evident that central bankers make for bad capitalists.Consider Germany’s AG Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in May 2016 for US$66bil in what was then the largest all-cash merger ever announced. The deal was controversial from the start as Bayer was going to need to raise billions of dollars. Traditionally, this means a company must go on a roadshow and explain its plan in great detail. Without evidence of a credible plan, capitalists will not part with their money.But not the ECB. It just so happened that in June 2016 the central bank began a new effort to stimulating the region’s economy by purchasing corporate bonds under an initiative dubbed Corporate Securities Purchase Program, or CSPP. So how did the ECB decide which corporate bonds to buy? The CSPP set up the following simple rules to qualify:> Incorporated in the eurozone and denominated in euros > Non-financial, including any parent company (the ECB was already in too deep with the banks) > Investment grade with a maturity between six months and 31 years > No asset-backed or structured securitiesNowhere in these rules were considerations such as coverage ratios, debt-to-equity percentages, use of cash, or management plans. The ECB left those issues to the credit rating companies. As long as a company kept its investment-grade rating, that was good enough for the ECB. The last time investors delegated investment decisions to ratings firms in this manner was mortgage securities in the early to mid-2000s. This was before housing collapsed, leading to large defaults on mortgage securities and ushering in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Lesson not learned at the ECB.Bayer’s Monsanto purchase has been nothing but problematic. The company said last week it lost a second trial over claims the weedkiller Roundup that came with the Monsanto deal causes cancer. Its shares have fallen to their lowest since 2012, although it retains an investment-grade rating for now.The ECB has been very secretive about the CSPP programme. It only publishes a list of company debt securities it holds, but not amounts. At last count, there are 1,192 corporate issues totalling 178 billion euros (US$200bil). Bayer is on the list, but the amount of debt the ECB bought to finance the Monsanto deal is unknown.The ECB should have known better. In September 2015, before the CSPP began, the ECB was buying car loans, asset-backed debt and securitised loans. This included the benchmark issuer of Volkswagen, which became embroiled in rigged emission tests in the US for its diesel cars. How important was the ECB to Volkswagen? When that scandal hit, the ECB announced that it would suspend purchases of Volkswagen debt securities. The move hurt the company’s ability to raise money.Or in January 2018 when the ECB was forced to sell its Steinhoff International Holdings NV debt after the company was downgraded to junk following accounting irregularities. The ECB’s cheap money, no questions ask programme also financed, maybe supported, other troubled companies such as Arkema SA, Proximus SADP and Glencore Plc.What does the ECB say about all of this? The central bank conducted a top-down macro study last year that concluded:Reassuringly, evidence of adverse side effects on corporate financing and market functioning as a result of the CSPP is rather scarce. In particular, the smooth implementation of the programme, underpinned by the flexible pace of Eurosystem purchases and its adaptability to dynamics in the primary market, has safeguarded corporate bond market functioning and liquidity conditions. Overall, these findings back up the assessment of a successful implementation of the programme under changing market conditions without having a distortive market impact.In other words, the ECB is falling into the trap of mistaking brains with a bull market. Buying bonds when things are good will show good results. The question is, are they creating easy money distortions so companies can engage is questionable behaviour? The ongoing saga of Bayer’s purchase of Monsanto thanks to the ECB suggests policymakers need to look deeper at the true costs of this programme. If they do, they might not like what they see. — BloombergJim Bianco is the president and founder of Bianco Research, a provider of data-driven insights into the global economy and financial markets.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/what-will-cause-the-next-debt-crisis/,What will cause the next debt crisis?,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"FOR her CBC Massey Lectures in 2008, Canadian writer Margaret Atwood chose to talk about debt. The text, written in the first half of the year (and later published as Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth), described how she’d noticed a lot more ads on public transportation for debt relief services. “Why are there so many of these ads? Is it because there are unprecedented numbers of people in debt? Very possibly,” she said. Today, more than 10 years after the global debt-driven financial crisis that Atwood intuited, angst remains. Central banks that bought bonds and kept interest rates low to spur economic recovery have fuelled record levels of corporate and government borrowing. While Atwood’s lectures considered debt from historical, theological, literary, and even ecological perspectives, we asked investors and analysts to consider a simpler question as this credit cycle ages: What could go wrong now?Kathleen Gaffney, vice-president and director of diversified fixed income at Eaton Vance ManagementIt’s got to be rates that cause a problem at some point. Then it’s a question of who goes first. Is it high yield? Is it loans? Is it investment grade (IG)? Because IG started to really crack more than high yield before December, because there just wasn’t enough of a cushion in credit spreads. It seems like it’s all wrapped up in credit markets. Then it seems like it would be liquidity. It’s hard to tell exactly where it’s going to come from. I don’t think there’s a particular sector that’s so levered up that it’s something like that. It could be everything all at once. Valuations are so tight there’s too much risk there. I don’t see it as a seizure as much as a dramatic lesson in price discovery. The idea that fixed income is no longer a safe hedge against equity volatility could create flows out of fixed income. There is this perception of safety. If you don’t have any return, then what’s the case for owning it?Kristin Forbes, professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management and a former Bank of England policymakerRisks are shifting to other sectors of the economy. We sometimes call it the shadow financial system. These risks now are in parts of the financial system that are less regulated, less monitored, and we have a less good idea of what those risks are and how they’re evolving. It could be the leveraged loan market, for example. Those are the sectors of the economy that I’m most worried about right now.Michael Temple, director of corporate credit research for the US at Amundi Pioneer Asset ManagementI actually don’t think it’s necessarily going to be the US that’s in the epicentre. I think it’s going to be overseas. Clearly growth is a lot slower in Europe right now, and you’re seeing a number of countries in recession. Could you see defaults and increasing problems in Europe that ultimately cycle back to the US? And what about China ? If China cannot reinvigorate growth with its current stimulus programme, then we could start to see problems coming out of China.Greg Hahn, president and CIO of Winthrop Capital ManagementWe think we’re on the front end of a potential shift in the credit cycle. It’s going to show differently this time. We think it’s going to be expressed in the public markets through leveraged loans. One of the telltale signs is structured securities. Issuance is up, CLOs (collateralised loan obligations) are up. We’re seeing covenant-lite loans that are coming to market. These are all signs; 2017, 2018, and 2019 vintage structured securities could be problematic.Adam Richmond, head of US Credit Strategy at Morgan StanleyPartly because of the last financial crisis, the system is safer. The chance of another systemic crisis is very low. What we’re looking at is something more like 2002 in terms of the leverage built up.Michael Buchanan, deputy chief investment officer at Western Asset ManagementI always say you follow the money, because that is where you really start to see excess risk build. Where is the money going now? Private credit. There’s quite a bit of money that’s flowing in that direction, whether through institutional managers or BDCs (business development companies).Investors didn’t necessarily need the liquidity that you get in the syndicated bond or syndicated loan market. If in exchange for that illiquidity risk, you could get better return on capital through higher yield – that made a lot of sense. There has been a tremendous amount of demand for private credit.But investors knowingly went into private credit understanding that there was real illiquidity there. The mark-to-market could be pretty painful when things do turn, but in terms of how they have these assets allocated, they fall within an illiquid bucket. That’s one factor that could prevent it from becoming a systemic crisis.Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities IncI don’t think there’s going to be another credit crisis because I don’t see the leverage in the trading system. In the financial crisis, everything was kind of interconnected. As soon as one part of the capital structure started getting in trouble, everything had to get sold. There was a lot of mark-to-market risk. I do think we can get bouts like we saw in December, where the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in particular drive prices lower, but they can rebound quickly. There’s just not liquidity. But I don’t see people being forced out of the market.Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD SecuritiesIf you do have people worried about the deficit plus a downturn, you could see an increase in real rates. You’re seeing this in Canada. Because their mortgage market is much more floating-rate, you’re seeing the impact on the consumer. A lot of people attribute the risk-off in the fourth quarter to the Fed’s shrinking balance sheet. I attribute it to the increase in real rates . When real rates rise, people move out of credit into Treasuries. If we get inflation, we can handle higher rates. If we don’t, that’s more damaging. — BloombergAbramowicz is co-host of Bloomberg Markets AM on Bloomberg Radio in New York."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/chinas-doghouse-is-smaller-than-it-looks/,China’s doghouse is smaller than it looks,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"All eyes in the trade world are fixed on the United States and China, with the world’s two largest economies locked in negotiations that could shape the contours of global commerce into the next decade.The issues on the table – technology transfer, intellectual property, cloud computing and the push by the United States to gain a bigger foothold for their financial and high-tech service industries – encompass the big battlefields of the 21st century economy. But a more telling look at the future of world trade might be found elsewhere, in disputes involving mundane commodities currently besetting Australia and Canada.Both have had very public political battles recently with China. They now have something else in common: some of their key exports are being shunned by Chinese buyers. The country’s importers started banning canola shipments in March from Canadian processors, citing contamination worries. In recent months, Chinese ports have also been turning away Australian thermal coal, on vaguely worded environmental grounds.It’s hard to find anyone in the Australian and Canadian governments and their respective business communities who believes these actions are motivated by anything other than politics. The Chinese themselves barely bother to deny it either.That illustrates two, seemingly contradictory, things: how willing Beijing is to use blunt economic coercion in political disputes, and, paradoxically, the constraints it faces in leveraging its market power.In recent months, China has threatened many countries with economic punishment over political issues. Either in official statements or through state-run media, Beijing has warned countries as diverse as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Germany and Spain over the consequences of keeping Huawei Technologies Co, the Chinese telecommunications giant, out of their next-generation 5G networks. Beijing issued veiled threats to the UK after Britain announced it would send an aircraft carrier into the South China Sea. With Turkey, it was more explicit, saying economic and commercial ties would be hit if Ankara kept criticising Beijing’s mass internment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Compared with the flurry of intimidation, though, cases of direct intervention are mostly confined to the Canadian and Australian examples. Beijing has a well-worn track record of using economic threats as a lever in diplomatic disputes. Norway had its salmon imports blocked after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010. Mangoes from the Philippines were left to rot after Manila won an international court case against Beijing on the South China Sea in 2016.The biggest set of sanctions were imposed on Seoul in the same year, when Beijing limited tourism to South Korea and harassed the country’s businesses inside China after its neighbour agreed to deploy a US anti-missile battery. Although the two countries normalised relations in late 2017, some unofficial restrictions still remain for Chinese travelling to South Korea.Still, for all the recent noise, China is selective in using trade to bully its adversaries, for several reasons.The ongoing trade war with the United States is one: while battling Washington, its peer adversary, Beijing doesn’t want to be fighting on other fronts. China’s weakening economy is an important constraint as well. Sanctions imposed by Beijing invariably bring blowback inside China, imposing extra costs on producers forced to source more expensive imports and on the local partners in joint venture companies with out-of-favour countries.Beijing also has to be careful about beating up on democracies like Australia and Canada. In a way that they weren’t even a few years ago, democratic countries in the west and Asia are swapping notes about China, largely in private, in ways they never have before.That’s helping to build an “alliance of multilateralists”, a term coined by Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas at a speech in Japan last year. If these governments see China punishing other countries for decisions any sovereign nation might take, the hawks in their own systems looking for ways to push back harder against Beijing will only be strengthened.Canada and Australia are being targeted largely because of clashes over Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Australia placed itself in the firing line early on with Huawei, by keeping it out of two major projects, the National Broadband Network in 2012, and the upgrade to the new 5G mobile network in 2018. In Canada’s case, the country’s police arrested Meng Wanzhou – Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder – in Vancouver in late 2018 on a US warrant, and refused Beijing’s demand that she be released. Beijing then detained two Canadian citizens in China, alleging violations of national security.The way that China has allowed parts of the anti-South Korea sanctions to linger bodes ill for these cases.The application to extradite Meng to New York to face fraud charges could be stuck in the Canadian and US courts for years. Australia and China had an official meeting last December to rebuild their relationship, but that seems to have achieved little, with China scaling back coal imports anyway.  The lesson so far seems clear. China’s bark is, so far at least, worse than its bite on threats of trade sanctions. Not as many counties as you might think get put in the Chinese doghouse – but once you are there, getting out can be a lengthy, painful process. — BloombergThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Richard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

A teenage girl from Beverly Hills went on an episode of Dr Phil, berating her mother for cutting her allowance from US$5,000 per month to US$1,000 a month, and refusing to get her a Mercedes G-Wagen worth over US$140,000.In the cringeworthy video, the mother regretfully admits to spoiling her daughter, and is at a loss of how to salvage the situation.It isn’t talked about enough, but it is clear that dysfunction tends to breed among the wealthy, especially among the young ones.For example, Paris Hilton, heir to the US$300mil Hilton hotel fortune. Paris, a symbol of celebrity privilege in America was famously remembered for the lavish and extravagant lifestyle that she has led. So much so that it has caused her grandfather Barron Hilton to pledge most of the family’s wealth to charity.But it’s not all bad news among the wealthy.There are also great examples of thoughtful parenting from the rich and famous. Bill and Melinda Gates are one of them. Despite amassing a total net worth of over US$96bil, their kids are well-grounded, highly-empathetic individuals whose aspirations involve pursuing further education and social work. The news of the Gates deciding to dedicate almost all of their wealth to philanthropy and leaving just a comfortable amount of US$10mil to their kids both surprised and impressed the world. Not only are they immensely generous, but they both hold firm in their values that with great wealth came great responsibility to give back to society.So, to all parents out there: how do you see yourself bringing up your kids? Do you want them to turn out privileged like the kids in reality shows? Or do you want them to grow into grateful and contributing members of society?In my years as a financial adviser, I’ve seen countless of married couples make the mistake of underestimating the need to instill financial literacy in their children from an early age. It is not only important for kids to grow up with the right values about money, but it is equally crucial that they know how to handle money.While each family is unique in their own challenges and needs, wealth-related issues – such as expenditure, child-rearing, wealth distribution, and the complications of divorce, remarriage and extended families – are usually quite common throughout, even when you are wealthy.So how do you ensure that your kids rise above and grow up to be individuals with a strong value system and a healthy mindset about money?Money talksMany wealthy parents tend to put off talking about their wealth with kids, either because they do not know how to handle it, or they think the knowledge will change them. The problem with this is that these kids may end up unprepared in the future when they eventually inherit their parents fortunes.It is important, therefore, to have the right conversations with your kids, and to bring them up with financial literacy to handle money matters that may come their way.But before that, have you and your spouse aligned your values about money? Disagreements about finances can be sensitive and stressful to your family relationship. Therefore, it is a good idea to discuss this in finer detail before deciding what values to pass down to your kids. Here are some questions to ponder:What does money mean to the both of you? Our opinions of money is usually based on our upbringing. When you communicate the role that money played in your respective families in your formative years, you will understand each others financial habits more clearly.Does your family have a coherent view about money? Once you have discussed your thoughts and feelings about money, it will be clear what values each of you hold, and how to align your value systems accordingly.What’s yours, what’s mine, and what’s ours? Who does the money belong to? Do you share everything, or keep some aside for your personal spending? Should one of you contribute more or should both of you contribute equally? If only one of you are working, who “owns” the money and makes the financial decisions? Each family has their own preferred way of doing things, but more importantly, make sure that you both agree to this arrangement. To what extent will you support your kids? Are you going to financially support your kids throughout their lives? Do you expect them to support themselves after a certain age? Will they be able to maintain the kind of lifestyle that they have now? A lot of wealthy parents forget that once their children start standing on their own two feet, the realities of a lifestyle change may come as a shock to them. What values do you want to instill in your kids? Your values about money will ultimately become your children’s values about money. If you believe in working hard and spending hard, your children will believe the same. If you think that building a good career is in itself a reward regardless of money, then guess what, your children will grow up believing the same. If you think that money commands respect, then your children will grow up thinking that wealthy people are worthy of their respect. Children mimic their parents’ values, so make sure you decide on healthy mindsets about money early on.Communicating these valuesOnce you both have agreed about the values you want to pass down to your kids, make sure you convey it to them regularly. Children are sharp and pick up on your behaviours quickly. Therefore, make sure that you are both consistent about keeping your values when dealing with financial matters.Most kids will ask their parents at one point in time about their financial status. When this happens, don’t shy away from the question – be as honest as you can in an age-appropriate way. For example, if your kids are young, they may not understand the concept of a trust fund. Instead, teach them about how money is earned, budgeted, and saved. Allowances are a good way to help them practice this, especially if you make them earn it by completing chores. Equip them with knowledge and principles about money instead of having it sprung onto them unprepared one day.In fact, one of my youngest clients was indeed someone who unexpectedly inherited a substantial amount of wealth from his parents. As he was never primed for this knowledge beforehand, he was taken aback and was at a loss of what to do with the money. Moral of the story: Parents need to groom their children well before the time comes to pass down their inheritance.Alternatively, to avoid such situations, some of my clients have appointed financial advisers for their children immediately after graduating from college. The idea here is to get a financial adviser that you trust to teach your children financial literacy and equip them with the tools to manage their wealth.What is important is that your family is aligned on the legacy you wish to pass down to your children in terms of inheritance and values. Families are unique in their value system, beliefs and goals, and these get more complex as your family grows. No parent wants their children to adopt dysfunctional values about money. To avoid this from happening, you need deliberate thought, support from your better half, and consistency when communicating your values to your children. Above that all, communicate these lessons from a place of love and dedication – things that money can’t buy.Yap Ming Hui ( ymh@whitman.com.my ) is thrilled that his mission to empower every Malaysian with a roadmap to financial freedom has finally come to fruition with the release of a free DIY roadmap to financial freedom tool on the iWealth mobile app."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/house-price-conundrum/,House price conundrum,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"RANI went to the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) in early March. She was interested in a landed unit and the property was only to be launched about a month later.
“It was a 5% rebate, not 10%,” she lamented.
She recalled reading in the papers that developers participating in the ongoing home ownership campaign which runs until June 30, 2019 would be offering a minimum of 10% rebate in their projects. “Why am I entitled to only 5% instead of 10%?” she asks.
In another case, a father said his son bought a house directly from the owner in the secondary market. He was a first-time house buyer.
On signing the sales and purchase agreement (SPA), a lawyer told him that the stamp duty exemptions were only for developers’ units and not for him.
The father who went by the pseudonym LJT wrote to The Star: “What is the rationale in limiting this exemption to only purchases from developers?”

“Is the government interested in the welfare of the poor or just the developers?”
Helping developers to sell their units, helping the house-buying public, mending a broken housing market are three distinct issues. 
They may seem the same as all three come under housing the nation, but as Rani and LJT have found out, the policies and objectives are varied and distinct.
The government-initiated campaign has only one objective – to reduce the unsold completed housing stocks developers are carrying in their books.
If a buyer finds a unit during the ownership campaign and gets to enjoy all the exemptions and rebates that come with the unit, that is secondary.
The over-riding objective of the developer, and the government, is that there is one less overhang unit in the books.
Converting unsold stocks
Developers are, therefore, trying to convert their stocks of unsold completed units into cash, industry sources say.
If the campaign, with all the rebates and government exemptions, succeeds in helping someone to buy a property, that meets a secondary objective; the primary objective is that, it helped the developer to offload his left-on-the-shelf product.
An industry source says: “Someone has to bear the cost of unsold units. If it were a strata development, the developer would bear the cost of its monthly maintenance. When a property is vacant, the degree of deterioration seems faster than if it were lived in.”
Every project promoted by a developer has its own unique terms and conditions, as Rani found out. A 5% and a 10% rebate is a  difference of RM40,000 for a RM800,000 house. If a project is yet to be launched, it is not part of the overhang. So,   although it is being promoted under the HOC, it may not get the 10% rebate as earlier promised in two Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association (Rehda) press conferences. 
An industry source says: “A developer has rebates for Project A but not for Project B because A was completed three years ago. 
“A developer has to convert these unsold units into cash. Project B is work-in-progress. There is less urgency for him to sell it. That accounts for the 5% discount, and not 10%, or more,” she says.
When a developer gives rebates and throws in the extra goodies, he is selling the unit cheaper than when it was first launched. Instead of decreasing his price, he is offering rebates, cash-back and other goodies. An outright decrease in price would upset the initial buyers, she says.
Innovative marketing strategies
The various packages are good indicators of the situation facing the residential sector currently.
> A change of name to give the project a fresh look 
> Financing has become more flexible –  buy now, pay later. 
The property costs RM300,000. On the SPA, it is stated as such. The buyer gets a 70% loan for RM210,000. There is a differential sum of RM90,000, which the buyer has to bear. Developers may offer to defer payment of this RM90,000 by X number of years.
Question is will the bank be left holding the baby if the buyer walks away after formalising the SPA?
> Some developers are offering interest-free loans
> Buyers pay booking fees of RM1,000 while some RM5,000. The first 10% – the minimum amount in order to formalised the sale – is waived.
The buyer pays a token sum because the first 10% is waived. He will have to consider where the payment is going to come from.
> Multi-tiered rebates. When a property is sold off-plan, the buyer follows a schedule of payment that goes something like this – the first 10% when the SPA is signed. The sale is formalised.  The second payment is another 10%, the third, 15% and the fourth another 10% and so on. 
When rebates are given 9% + 1% (tier one), 4% + 6% (tier 2), 3% + 7% (tier 3), this means the buyer pays 1% in order to formalise the sale, 6% when the second scheduled payment is due, and 7% on the third scheduled payment
> Rebates versus discounts
There is a difference between rebates and discounts. 
Consider Example 1 and 2 (see chart)
> Buyers rewarded with cash-back offers.  This happens when the  price stated in the SPA is higher than what the buyer actually has to pay. His loan amount is based on this higher value. So when he gets  rebates and gets a high-margin loan, he gets cash in return. 
Says an industry source: “Some developers have taken rebates to a new ‘cash-back’ level.”
Malaysia Consumers Movement president Darshan Singh Dhillion related his confusion in his letter to The Star (published April 4). He was interested in a house, which according to his calculation, cost RM658,000. 
“... the sales agent said the SPA would be for RM800,000. Upon asking why, a confusing cash-back by percentage formula was disclosed. This cash-back is supposed to help me satisfy the downpayment requirement, or I may use it for renovation purposes. Why is the pricing so complicated? 
“The developer should come clean and stick to one offer price and work it through the entire loan application process in compliance with the established rules and regulations,” he wrote.
Need for transparency
Buyers have to mentally remove layers of confusion to get to the real net price because developers want to “hold on to their prices” instead of an outright price reduction.
This situation, says an industry source, does not serve the Housing Ministry and the banking sector at all. 
“Only the developer and the buyer, after removing layers of confusing calculations, know the real nett price,” the source says.
The “real price” is hidden from the banking sector which provides the financing. It is also hidden from the government housing agencies which use the data for research.
The National Property Information Centre, under the Valuation and Property Services Department, monitors house prices. 
Each quarter the department, which is under the Housing Ministry, issues quarterly reports about various aspects of the property sector. It also prepares the Malaysia House Price Index. 
The department bases its research on the price stated in the Sales & Purchase Agreements (SPAs) and the banking sector approves housing loans based on the SPAs.
The SPA must, therefore, show the nett (or real) price, and not some figure inflated by rebates, free furniture and electrical goods. 
There must be transparency in the SPAs, says the source. Or the research done by the government and the Malaysia House Price Index will be distorted.
Over the past several years, rebates, discounts, electrical goods, holidays and furniture have inflated prices in the SPAs. 
One may ask, why is all this important? Wrong information is better than no information at all because wrong information leads to distortion.
All information provided by the government for the housing sector, or whatever sectors for that matter, must reflect the true condition and position of the market."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/ihh-faces-rocky-path-in-india/,IHH faces rocky path in India,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"TO put it in a nutshell, the controversy surrounding healthcare group IHH Healthcare Bhd  is quite simple.KPMG, the external auditor of IHH, is worried that the healthcare group will have to make more provisions for its acquisition of the Fortis Healthcare group in India in the future. This is on the back of the Securities and Exchange Board of India or SEBI still investigating Fortis for dubious dealings when it was managed by its former major shareholder and chairman Malvinder Singh.As the external auditor, it has raised the red flag, which is rare for a company the stature of IHH that has institutional shareholders and is one of Khazanah Nasional Bhd’s brightest prospects.The company, on the contrary, was confident that the books of Fortis had already been cleaned up when it acquired a 31.1% stake in November last year. This includes a sum of 4,450 million rupees (RM261.2mil) in investments that the Fortis group had made  and is not recoverable.IHH contends that other contingencies such as tax bills and claims had already been taken into account when the purchase was made. The Malaysia-Singapore based healthcare group has taken control of the board and is prepared to increase its interest by up to 26% more if the court allows it to do so. So far, the capital markets, which are an indicator of how much confidence a company draws, has stuck with IHH. The share price of IHH took a hit in the few days after the news of KPMG’s concerns came out, but recovered later.Even before IHH completed the purchase of the 31.1% in Fortis, it was already courting the Indian hospital group – as early as in 2017.  When the healthcare company came to the market due to its financial distress, IHH, which then had Khazanah as its single largest shareholder, seized the opportunity.There were several bidders and almost all had a partner from India to put in a joint proposal for Fortis. It is easy to fathom why a local partner is conducive. The market, especially for the services sector ranging from financials to telecommunications and healthcare, is difficult and highly competitive.Not only is the competition tough, but manoeuvring through the various regulatory requirements in itself is a minefield. That is why most companies take on a company or individual from India as a partner to venture into sectors such as healthcare.IHH, however, decided to go it alone. It had been courting Fortis for a long time but could not strike a deal with the Singh brothers. When Fortis came back into the market due to its financial distress, IHH put in a strong challenge and won the prize – which is taking control of a dominant player in the Indian healthcare industry.That the external auditor has raised concerns on IHH’s acquisition of Fortis does not surprise many familiar with the history of the shareholders of the Fortis group.Malvinder and Shivinder had a brush with IHH in 2010, which did not turn out well for the Malaysian group, then known as Parkway Hospital Group. Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo won an arbitration case against Malvinder and Shivinder for concealing vital information when the brothers sold Ranbaxy to the Japanese group. The Japanese group is still unable to enforce judgement from the arbitration.Also, for IHH, despite it being in India for the past 15 years, progress has not been smooth.Its joint venture to build a 450-bed hospital in Khubchandani, Mumbai, has not taken off due to disagreements with the joint-venture partner. Towards this end, IHH provided an additional RM33.35mil last year, for a total provision of RM126mil for this project.In 2015, IHH bought into Continental Hospitals and Global Hospitals, which so far has brought about mixed results. According to the latest audited statement, Continental Hospitals has an operating loss, while the Global group is profitable.IHH’s most profitable operations are from Singapore, followed by Malaysia and Turkey. But IHH has its fair share of problems in Turkey due to the prolonged depreciation of the lira that has resulted in the company having to provide for its investments.IHH, which has invested RM5.5bil in Turkey, provided for RM2.6bil for the period ended December 2018. Nevertheless, its presence in Turkey has made the hospital group one of the most sought-after companies.It has a substantial footprint from Hong Kong to Singapore, Malaysia and up to Turkey. India was the missing link, but it has since been plugged with the acquisition of Fortis.IHH’s management, led by Dr Tan See Leng, is seen as capable and having been able to manage its risk well so far. The company has rolled out a 100-day plan for Fortis and is confident that it can overcome the minefield that is India.India’s healthcare market, although lucrative, is volatile. More often than not, private companies, especially those controlled by foreign investors, become the whipping boys when there are issues. The free market enterprise is strong and there is no government to support foreign investors when sentiment turns against them.That is the reason why most foreign investors team up with local companies. The understanding is that the local partner is there to help fend off the heat from foreign investors.In the case of Fortis, the financial troubles of the company make it even more difficult.For IHH, which now has Mitsui of Japan as its single largest shareholder, it is going to be the long haul in Fortis.In IHH’s books, the Fortis acquisition comes with a goodwill of RM1.52bil, which is quite a substantial amount. There is a reason why IHH paid a huge amount above the market value – the brand name Fortis and its credibility.However, whether Fortis is worth all the risk and money is still debatable. Note: In this column last week, it was stated that Maybank’s return on equity (ROE) was 9.91%. It has been brought to our attention that the ROE was 11.4%. The error is regretted."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/deflation--is-it-real/,Deflation – is it real?,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"WHEN a country’s inflation rate goes into contraction, what does it really imply about the economy? Are prices of goods and services really falling, benefitting all consumers, or is it a symptom of something worse to come?  In layman’s term, price deflation refers to the decrease in prices of goods and services within the economy, when the inflation rate contracts and falls below 0%. However, we must look deeper into the breakdown of the index that calculates the inflation rate, in Malaysia’s case, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).During the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period, the Malaysian economy fell into deflation for six consecutive months from June until November 2009, contracting between 0.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 2.4% y-o-y. Prior to that, prices of goods and services soared as high as 8.5% y-o-y while our country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth was already declining by 5.8% y-o-y before entering the deflation period.According to the Statistics Department, our economy was experiencing a deflation when the CPI contracted in the first two months of 2019 by 0.4% y-o-y and at 0.7% y-o-y respectively, a first time occurrence since the GFC period in 2009.However, the CPI has been steadily expanding below 1.0% y-o-y from June 2018 until December 2018, before the two months of deflation period. At the same time, GDP growth has been increasing at a healthy pace of 4.5% y-o-y in the second half of 2018 and is expected to grow at a similar pace in the first quarter of 2019.Therefore, it may raise some questions among the public – is the current deflation period a temporary phenomenon, or will it prolong and become severe enough to prompt the government into an intervention using fiscal or monetary policy measures similar to those used during the GFC period?Many people would think that a deflating economy is always associated with difficult economic times, for instance, deteriorating GDP growth or high unemployment like it was in Japan since the early 1990s or in the United States during the Great Depression.Yet, not all deflationary periods are associated with poor economic conditions. According to the World Bank, inflation rate in Japan contracted at an average of around 0.5% yearly from 2000-2005, but the GDP was still growing at an average of 1.5% y-o-y – above its 2000-2017 average growth of 1.0% y-o-y.Nevertheless, it is worthy to note that the same severe GDP contraction as seen during the GFC is unlikely to occur at present with industrial production growth still expanding steadily at a healthy pace.Are prices really falling?  Moving back to breaking down the components of CPI, consumers in general, did not really feel any positive and material impact when CPI contracted in the first two months of 2019. Our analysis shows that CPI fell mainly due to the drop in transport segment (January: -7.8% y-o-y and February: -6.8% y-o-y), following the fixing of RON95 and diesel prices in recent months. The impact of the pump prices is sizable on overall index, with the transportation index accounting for 14.6% of overall CPI. However, the core inflation which excludes the volatile items from the CPI basket (food and transport segments) expanded by 0.3% y-o-y, indicating underlying inflation and prices of non-core items remains high. Consumers may have temporarily benefitted from lower prices for petrol and certain goods. However, as a weighted average of 12 sub-components in CPI, the cost has outweighed the benefits. As such, falling headline inflation does not necessarily mean that the prices of all goods and services in the economy are falling.On a positive side, falling transportation costs offset the rising prices of two essential items in the CPI basket.  These are food and non-alcoholic beverages as well as housing and utilities. Lower cost of living?To determine whether low or negative inflation will translate into lower cost of living, we need to analyse the breakdown of household consumption expenditure pattern. Based on the findings by the statistics department in 2016, rising inflation generally affects the bottom 40% (B40) households more than the middle 40% (M40) households, given their spending patterns. Since the wages and salaries have remained sticky downwards, high cost of living would remain an issue in the long term. In 2016, the statistics department reported that the mean for monthly household consumption expenditure increased to RM4,033 in 2016 from an average of RM2,574 during the period of 2003 to 2014. On the other hand, Bank Negara stated in its annual report in 2018 that the mean expenditure of the B40 households has expanded at a faster pace compared to their income. From 2014 to 2016, B40 household expenditure jumped 6.0% (2016: RM2,284 per month; 2014: RM2,027 per month), higher than the average income growth (+5.8%) in this category.Spending patternThe B40 households spent most of their income on food (25.5% of total consumption), utilities (24.7% of total consumption), and transport (11.8% of total consumption). If we were to compare the CPI in the first two months of 2019, prices of food and utilities were still rising steadily (+1.0% and +2.0% respectively).Therefore, it is not surprising why most consumers are still complaining about the rising cost of living despite contraction in inflation, since food and shelter are classified as basic human survival needs according to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.  In order to bring down the cost of living to a manageable level, there is still much to be done by the government, especially for the B40 group.Sky-rocketing inflation rate or negative inflation rate are both unhealthy for an economy in general. Most central banks tend to set their inflation rate target at a comfortable level of 2%.Thus, it is very much necessary for the government to undertake policies that could stimulate demand-pull inflationary pressures back to our economy by focusing on income and labour productivity growth. Nevertheless, we expect this deflationary period to be short-lived, as inflationary pressures are expected to normalise towards the second half of the year after the implementation of proposed targeted subsidies for pump prices.In fact, the targeted subsidies will likely cause inflation within the transport sector to trend higher since the price ceiling would only be applicable to the targeted B40 group. After the implementation, pump prices for other consumers will revert to the weekly floating mechanism which adheres to the Brent crude oil price level. On a positive note, Bank Negara has forecast GDP to expand between 4.3% and 4.7% in 2019 against the backdrop of a challenging global environment. Responding effectively to future jolts to the economy is crucial in preserving the growth of our nation.Manokaran Mottain is the chief economist at Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/06/when-looking-east-means-china/,When looking east means China,Business News,"Saturday, 6 Apr 2019",,"A trip to watch cherry blossoms in Japan requires precision planning with loads of good luck. The unpredictability as to when the cherry tree will blossom in spring has made planning for the trip much more difficult, as the cherry blossom lasts for only two weeks in a year.The other unpredictable factor is the weather. When we landed on Sunday night, it was 6ºC. It was the end of the previous week’s temperature of 6ºC to 17ºC. In the last few days, the temperature plunged to 2ºC-8ºC. My daughter told me that the temperature for the following week would be 6ºC-17ºC. Just my luck, as I did not sign up for a winter trip.With the cold weather, having a bowl of hot ramen is a must and the average cost is about 1,000 yen (RM40) a bowl. So, using the noodle/ramen index, a bowl of noodles in Kyoto costs four times as much as in KL. Rental of property would be six to 10 times more, depending on the city you are in vis-a-vis Kuala Lumpur. Generally, salaries in Japan are three to four times higher than in Malaysia, so I believe middle-class Malaysians (excluding the B40’s)  have better purchasing power parity compared with middle-class Japanese.After getting the samurai bonds guaranteed by the Japanese government, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is encouraging a Look East policy again. He feels that Malaysians should learn about adopting the work ethics and value system of the Japanese. Back in 1982, six months after becoming Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir launched his Look East Policy, an initiative to learn from the experience of Japan in the nation-building of Malaysia. He wanted to send young Malaysians to Japan to pursue undergraduate programmes and train in technical skills/technologies.Japan had become the manufacturing centre for cheap electronics, household appliances and cars in the 1960s and 70s. Since then, it has moved up the value chain, with Toyota occupying the No 1 position by selling over 10 million vehicles. Only Volkswagen plus a host of other merged brands sell more. The latest big player is the merged Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi conglomerate. But the Japanese have conceded leadership on electronics, household appliances and television sets to Samsung and LG and also to Haier of China. The same goes for the microchip industry, etc. The domestic market has been well protected all these years by numerous trade barriers. Now, Japan’s international image is being upheld by investment visionary Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank CEO who first invested in Alibaba almost 20 years ago. Son has also invested in Uber, Didi and Grab, to name a few of his continuous mega-investments. Now, they have started Alibaba Japan with a 65%:35% JV with alibaba.com.Japan has four million SMEs, almost 10 times the number of SMEs in Malaysia. SMEs account for 25% of the country’s export value and 63% of its import value, but it is an ageing society. Japan’s growth has been driven by local consumption for many years now. Many legacies from its manufacturing past have not been transformed fast enough to counter the growth of South Korea and China. I do not believe Dr Mahathir is making the right call now to Look East-Japan. He should adopt a Look East-China policy. The sale of 49% of Proton to Geely China is bearing fruit now, as it has garnered 25,000  bookings for the X70 SUV within a few months of its launch. This must be the biggest success of Proton in the last 10 years. China can help us rebuild KTM’s national railway line at a fraction of the cost as compared with Japanese or French technology. We can build a fast-train network from Thailand to Johor Baru, assuming that Dr Mahathir still cannot agree to work with Singapore on the JB-Singapore segment. Huawei can help install 5G network in Malaysia ahead of other Asean countries or even earlier than the United States. On a bilateral exchange arrangement, China will absorb all our palm oil production that Europe threatens not to buy. Alibaba can set up a regional Asean HQ with an R&D team in Malaysia, and fund digital schools to train Malaysians on e-commerce and e-wallets besides its earlier promise of using Malaysia as its launchpad into other Asean countries. Besides the white coffee and Musang King durian, I am sure we can launch authentic Malaysian products in the world’s biggest market, including halal products for their 21 million Muslims. Malaysia has only 18 million Muslims.On Dr Mahathir’s fear of the rich Chinese moving into Malaysia after buying our high-end condos, this phenomenon has happened in all the major cities of the world. The Chinese have been buying property in Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. They have been the biggest investors in global property in the last 10 years.There is no fear of an influx of China nationals into our country. Our immigration department already has a strict anti-China policy in place. We should encourage the Chinese investors instead, as we have a huge surplus of high-end condos that is killing our property developers. A short-term solution to solve a major problem in the property sector.The Look East-China policy can be profitably managed for the next 10 years while we transform our education programme for our national schools. The rise of Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China in the world economy is mainly due to their high-level education system which starts from primary school. Their focus has always been on Maths, Science and Technology, so they have been building a talent pool to sustain their advancement in building their economy.Just looking east at China is but a short-term solution. As Tun Daim Zainuddin said in his recent speech on the “National Narrative: Malays within the national context” at a local university, excerpts from his speech included that for Malaysia to get the four sectors of politics, economy, culture and religion right, we must first change our education system. Malaysia’s future depends on giving our children the right type of education that will allow them to be confident to face the best in the world. Expose our children to the world, then they will want to excel and they will protect the best of our culture. Dr Mahathir and Daim are gravely concerned about the declining standards of our national schools which have a 80%-90% Malay student population. Too many religious classes compared with Maths, Science and Technology. Students are thinking emotionally rather than critically. As Malays form 60% of our population, there is a tremendous shortage of a talent pool which has adequate knowledge of Maths, Science, Technology and English.How are we then as a nation to compete with Singapore, Japan, South Korea and China without a continuous supply of relevant talent? Or are we happy to strike some short-term deals with Japan and China just to tide through difficult economic times?Short-term economic success for a nation is like a cherry tree blossoming for two weeks in a year. I would prefer to grow the hibiscus that will flower throughout the year. We should predict our own destiny and not rely on unpredictable trade partners, no matter how profitable it may seem."

The Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder once more endorsed the sector’s infamous 12-hours-a-day, six-days-a-week routine as de rigueur for passionate young workers. 

In a lengthy Sunday blog post, China’s richest man expanded on comments from last week, in which he dismissed people who expect a typical eight-hour office lifestyle.

“As I expected, my comments internally a few days ago about the 996 schedule caused a debate and non-stop criticism,” Ma wrote. 

“I understand these people, and I could have said something that was correct’. But we don’t lack people saying 'correct’ things in the world today, what we lack is truthful words that make people think.”

Ma’s earlier comments stoked a fierce ongoing debate over tales of programmers and founders dying from unrelenting stress. 

Chinese tech workers protested labor conditions on the online code-sharing community GitHub in March under the banner 996.ICU, which quickly became the site’s most popular topic.

“Based on data from Bursa, foreign funds sold RM289.3mil net of local equities last week. 


“So far in 2019, international funds have been net sellers on Bursa for nine out of fifteen weeks,” the research house said in its weekly fund flow report. 


International funds started the week with a decent foreign net outflow of RM12.0mil on Monday, the lowest in 11 trading days. 


The level of foreign net selling jumped by more than four times on Tuesday to reach RM53.1mil as Bursa’s telecommunication index led decliners amongst the sectoral indices.


MIDF said investors shrugged off the cut in the International Monetary Fund’s economic growth outlook for 2019 from 3.5% to 3.3%. 


“As such, offshore investors made their way back to Malaysian shores on Wednesday to a tune of RM67.6mil net, a level not seen in 17 trading days,” it said. 


The next two days saw the resumption of foreign net selling on Bursa but at a higher pace of above RM100mil. 


MIDF said Thursday recorded the highest foreign net outflow during the week at RM165.4mil due to the report of Khazanah Nasional Berhad offering the sale of Tenaga Nasional Bhd  (TNB) shares under a share placement to raise RM1.05bil, causing the share price of TNB to drop by 4.1%. 


The FBM KLCI closed at the 1,624 points, the lowest close since late December 2016.


MIDF noted that the announcement of the continuation of the ECRL project at a lower cost on Friday helped to reduce foreign net selling level to RM126.4mil. 


The local bourse reacted positively to the announcement by gaining for the first time in three days to settle at 1,630 points on Friday.


“On a year-to-date basis, foreign funds have sold RM2.05bil net of local equities.


“Amongst the four Asean markets we monitor, Malaysia retains its position as the nation with the largest foreign net outflow amongst the four Asean markets we monitor,” MIDF said.

“There are certain commitments that the United States is making in this agreement, and there are certain commitments that China is making,” Mnuchin told reporters Saturday at the IMF meetings in Washington.

“I would expect that the enforcement mechanism works in both directions, that we expect to honor our commitments, and if we don’t, there should be certain repercussions, and the same way in the other direction,” he said.

Mnuchin said the two countries are making progress in talks to end their nine-month trade and tariff war, which has cast a cloud over global growth and financial markets. Under the pact being discussed, the U.S. and China would each establish an “enforcement office” to monitor compliance, he said.

The U.S. and China are discussing whether to hold more in-person meetings, Mnuchin said, after talks in Beijing and then Washington in recent weeks. “We’re hopefully getting very close to the final round of these issues,” he said.

The IMF cited trade tensions as a risk this week as cut its outlook for global growth to the lowest since the financial crisis a decade ago.

Claims incurred ratio of Lonpac increased slightly to 47.4% from 47.1% and with management expense ratio at 22.0% and commission ratio at higher 5.2%, the combined ratio was recorded at 74.6%, an increase from 72.4% reported in the previous corresponding quarter. 

“With a higher combined ratio but an improved net earned premium written, Lonpac was able to register an underwriting profit of RM59.6mil,” he said.

Teh said that continued uncertainties in the global economy coupled with stiff competition in the local insurance market in the light of a liberalising market will remain the main challenges for the group. 

“However, the government’s plan to proceed with the implementation of some infrastructure projects that were suspended earlier will spur the demand for insurance coverage especially in project insurances where Lonpac is an active player. 

“We will continue to innovate new products to meet the insurance needs of the customers and further strengthen our market position. With the concerted efforts of the staff and support from our partners, we are confident that the group will be able to continue reporting improved performance and create value for shareholders,” Teh said."

According to Prestariang, the concession agreement clearly spells out the government's obligations in the event the project is terminated by way of expropriation.

The group claimed it had incurred substantial expenses in extensive technical studies and works on the project since 2014, as well as entered numerous third-party contracts in executing the project.

PSkin had secured the 15-year concession on Aug 9, 2017, to design and manage a new immigration and border control system for the Immigration Department to replace the older system. 

""PSKIN was to receive approximately RM3.5bil over the 15-year concession period, subject to the entire capital expenditure being privately funded by PSKIN. 

""Payment to PSKIN by the GOM would only commence after SKIN is completely operational,"" said Prestariang.

Subsequent to the termination of the project, the parties failed to negotiate a settlement on the payment obligation.

The claim of RM732.86mil is calculated based on the contractual formula provided in the concession agreement which had been agreed to by the governemnt, said Prestariang.

In addition to the RM732.86mil, Pskin is also claiming interest on the sum at a rate of 5% per annum from the date of the judgment, and costs.

""The financial impact of the Originating Summons to Prestariang Group shall be subject to the compensation amount awarded by the Court. 

""The Board remains positive on the claims against the GOM pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement,"" said Prestariang.

It added that it does not expect any operational impact or losses for the group save for the legal fees arising from the legal action."

Developers sold 1,054 units last month, more than double the 455 in February, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said in a statement Monday. Residential home prices decreased for a second straight quarter in the three months ended March 31 after the government added cooling measures in July, helping to buoy demand.

Sentiment is proving most positive in the super-luxury segment with a significant pick up in sales, property broker OrangeTee &amp; Tie Pte said. In March, 25 new homes were sold above the S$5 million ($3.7 million) mark, the most since December 2013. Ten of those apartments were bought by Singaporeans while 15 were purchased by foreigners, URA data show. (In Singapore, foreigners can’t purchase so-called landed property, except on Sentosa Island.)

S$28 Million Penthouse

The highest-priced unit was a penthouse apartment at Boulevard 88, a luxury development near the famous Orchard Road shopping precinct, that went for S$28 million, or S$4,927 per square foot. That’s the highest price per square foot for a new unit since June 2013, according to OrangeTee.

“Having being on the sidelines since the introduction of the property-cooling measures eight months ago, buyers and investors have started to feel more confident,” said Ismail Gafoor, the chief executive officer of PropNex Realty. “Developers are continuing to price sensitively.” - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/trade-rows-cloud-global-economy/,Trade rows cloud global economy,Economy,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"WASHINGTON: Trade disputes and tighter financial conditions are among the top threats to a slowing world economy, global finance officials said, urging countries to take steps to shore up growth.The global expansion, now seen at its most sluggish pace in three years, is likely to firm up next year, but central banks and fiscal authorities have limited policy options to drive a rebound, officials said in the joint communique of the International Monetary Fund’s steering committee.“While we expect to see a pickup (in growth) next year, trade tensions, geopolitical risks, political instability are among the challenges,” Lesetja Kganyago, the committee’s chairman and the South African Reserve Bank’s governor, said at a press conference after the panel adjourned its semi-annual meeting.“We agreed we need to act promptly to protect the expansion.”“Fiscal policy for example should remain flexible and growth-friendly, rebuild buffers, and strike the right chord between debt sustainability and supporting demand,” Kganyago said, capping the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.The sober mood among finance leaders at the meetings this week was a stark contrast to the optimism that characterised the gathering one year ago when officials were heralding a rare period of robust and synchronised growth.This week’s proceedings kicked off with the IMF cutting its global growth outlook for the third time in six months. The world economy will likely grow 3.3% this year, the slowest expansion since 2016 and 0.2 percentage points below the global lender’s estimate from January.Major central banks including the US Federal Reserve have responded to the slowdown by putting policy-tightening efforts on hold. That has eased the pressures that global financial markets felt at the end of 2018, which contributed to the unwanted tightening of financial conditions partly blamed for the economic weakening.Growth is projected to firm up in 2020, the IMF said, but some officials are worried the expected rebound will be threatened if the weakening in developed economies such as the United States, Japan and Europe worsens.“Despite the expected improvement in global economic growth, if economic slowdowns in major economies feed into other economies, the prospects for growth might deteriorate, bringing uncertainty across the entire global economy,” Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said in his statement to the IMF committee.There is some cause for optimism. In Europe, many of the global factors weighing on growth appear to be waning, keeping alive expectations for a recovery in the second half of the year, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said at a separate press conference.But he also warned that factors that undermine confidence, including the risk of a hard Brexit and a global trade war, continue to “loom large,” putting growth at risk.Trade disputes, especially the standoff between the United States and China, have been a central talking point at the meetings this week and have been widely cited as a primary driver behind the weakening of the global economy.“If you model tariffs on a large portion of the goods that are traded, you take the entire volume of goods traded between the US and China in particular, US$500bil, you apply tariffs to that, you are putting at risk 0.8% of global growth,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.Earlier, China took a swipe at US President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies at the centre of the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies, including tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.“The protectionism of some countries has harmed mutual trust among countries, limited the scope for multilateral cooperation, and impeded the willingness to achieve it,” Chen Yulu, a vice-governor at the People’s Bank of China, said in a statement to the IMFC.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on the sidelines of the meetings that a US-China trade agreement would go “way beyond” previous efforts to open China’s markets to US companies and hoped that the two sides were “close to the final round” of negotiations.Japan, which will kick off its own negotiations with the Trump administration in Washington on Monday aimed at averting automotive tariffs, also bemoaned the current state of trade.“The prolonging of trade tensions and policy uncertainties pose a serious risk to the global economy by undermining private investment, disrupting global supply chains and weakening productivity growth,” Aso said. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/15/digital-lenders-lure-unbanked-argentines-out-of-shadow-economy/,Digital lenders lure unbanked Argentines out of shadow economy,SMEBiz,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"MARIA Rosales, 39, is one of millions of less affluent Argentines locked out of the traditional financial sector. The former cruise ship worker lost her job in 2015 and has relied on her family for financial support to stay afloat since.
Now her small pot of savings is in demand from a new group of lenders: digital banks on the hunt to mop up funds from the country’s huge shadow economy.
The nascent shift could shake up how people save their money in a market noticeable for a heavy reliance on cash, a paucity of bank savings and little trust in traditional banks or the volatile local peso, which lost half its value against the dollar last year.
Argentine bank deposits as a portion of gross domestic product are just 18.8%, according to a recent OECD report, which said the country had a “scarcity of domestic savings.”
That compares to nearly 60% in neighbouring Brazil. In Mexico, which has also been promoting alternatives to traditional banking, it is almost 30%.
“I do not know if there is a sector in Argentina as behind as the financial one,” Stefano Angeli, chief executive of Rebanking, a digital bank which will start operations in May, told Reuters.
“We believe digital banking will be the way to develop this business in the long term.”
As well as start-ups, international lenders are looking at getting into Argentina’s digital banking market. Banco Santander has said its digital bank will launch in the country soon, while Brazil’s Itau Unibanco said last year it was looking at opening online-only accounts in Argentina.
When Rosales became unemployed, her former bank started to charge her to keep her old account open and she did not have the paperwork such as payslips and utility bills needed to open a new one.
Instead, she turned to local digital lender Wilobank, which touts easy access and gives her some interest on her savings – important with inflation running at 50% annually.
“You become a client in minutes without going anywhere,” Wilobank says on its website.
Rival Brubank says, “You will need a few minutes. Have your national identity document at hand and that’s it.”
Lucas Llach, a former vice president at Argentina’s central bank who focused on financial inclusion, said the shift was logical, with so many people unable to access brick-and-mortar banks.
“There is a population that does not feel welcome (in traditional banks),” he told Reuters, adding the advent of digital lenders could help the government by bringing more funds out of the unregulated shadow sector.
“Technology lowers the costs of banking, and with these new technologies – where everything is digital – it becomes profitable to have lower-income clients.”
Firms like online auction company MercadoLibre Inc, recently invested in by PayPal, and George Soros-backed Uala are also pushing technology such as digital wallets and payment apps.
“There is a market because there are many people who are not banked, who do not want the costs of traditional banks,” Wilobank President Guillermo Francos told Reuters.
Wilobank said it has attracted 25,000 clients in its first six months of operation, and expects to hit 100,000 by the end of the year and 300,000 by late 2020.
The government has sought to help the sector, cutting red tape and making it faster to set up new banks.
A central bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said this could help force established lenders to become more competitive, something the bank has been pushing for to bolster savings accounts and shore up the local peso.
Digital banking heads told Reuters they were looking to reinvest deposits into the same kinds of instruments traditional banks use, including high-interest government debt that has been a boon for lenders.
Luring hard-hit Argentines back to the financial sector will not be easy, however. Many lost their savings during a major financial crisis in 2002, since then a sharp devaluation of the peso and a period of currency controls battered trust in banks.
Nicolás Cánepa, a 39-year-old scientific researcher, is wary but curious. He opened a digital account earlier this year and got a credit and debit card within a week.
“I kept the accounts I have in traditional banks because I get some benefits,” he said in a telephone interview, adding, however, he got a better interest rate on the new digital account.
“I did not put all my salary in. For now it’s a test.” — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/15/social-entrepreneurs-struggle-to-strike-a-balance/,Social entrepreneurs struggle to strike a balance,SMEBiz,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"FROM tackling pollution to improving access to healthcare, social entrepreneurs try to use businesses to help solve some of the world’s greatest problems but many agree the magnitude of doing so with limited means can take a personal toll.At the Skoll World Forum, Britain’s leading conference on social entrepreneurship, about 1,200 leaders from social enterprises and non-profit organisations from more than 80 countries last week discussed their greatest challenges.In a 2016 Thomson Reuters Foundation poll on the best countries for social entrepreneurs, about 900 experts said their biggest challenges were that people did not know what they did. Charmian Gooch, co-founder and director of Global Witness, a UK-based charity that investigates natural resource-related conflict and corruption, said change was slow and fighting big problems with limited means was an uphill struggle.“The biggest challenge is seeing how much needs to be done and changed and being realistic about our resources and capacities,” said Gooch, on the sidelines of the 16th annual Skoll forum held over four days in Oxford.“There is so much out there that needs tackling and one is always trying to do more and do it effectively, and keeping that sense of frustration in perspective.”The past decade has seen a surge in the number of social enterprises, with an estimated 470,000 in Britain in 2017 employing about 1.4 million people, according to government data. There was no comparison figures due to new methodology.Social sector organisations account for more than 5% of economic output in several countries, including Canada, Germany and the US, according to the British Council, a state-funded body that promotes British culture overseas.But balancing personal needs, alongside running a healthy organisation that delivers social impact, is a challenge, said Bradley Myles, chief executive of Polaris, the US-based anti-trafficking group.“You are taking on these enormous entrenched challenges, from a place of scarcity, with enormous demand on yourself, and enormous demands on your own organisation,” he said.“How do you balance all of those different things at once and achieve the impact you are trying to achieve?”Olawale Adebiyi, chief executive officer of Wecyclers, a Nigerian recycling business that collects and repurposes household waste, said the challenge was also getting good people to work for less pay.“When you try to scale and grow globally, you need the best talent, but as a social enterprise we can’t compete,” he said.He said that people, like himself, a trained engineer, have to be motivated enough by the social mission of the business as they cannot pay as highly as other bigger companies.But social entrepreneurs also recognised that they cannot solve these problems alone.For Harambee, a South African jobs and training social enterprise, both policy change and support from the private sector were needed to help it solve the youth unemployment crisis, said Sharmi Surianarain, solutions design lead.“It is not enough for one small part of the problem to be solved because the problem is huge and requires all the parts of the broken system to be addressed,” said Surianarain, whose organisation won one of this year’s five Skoll awards.Being a social enterprise “definitely adds another layer of challenge” to running a business, said Kola Masha, managing director of Babban Gona, a Nigerian social enterprise that gives business and financial support to smallholder farmers.“If you have the wrong investors, you are trying to drive towards a mission and they are trying to optimise short term financial return. Fundamentally, if you are working on the long term, mission and returns on investment can co-exist,” he said. Growing confusionAs businesses with a mission to do good become increasingly trendy, social entrepreneurs said they were finding it harder than ever to tackle one of their major problems – explaining what they do.For years, social entrepreneurs have faced the same question: are you running a charity or a business?There is no universally accepted definition, but a social entrepreneur can be described as someone who applies commercial strategies to tackle social and environmental problems and can operate as a for-profit or not-for-profit business.A Thomson Reuters Foundation poll in 2016 found almost 60% of social enterprise experts in the 45 biggest economies said there was a lack of public awareness about their work, which made it harder to raise funding and sell products and services.While the sector has continued to grow in recent years with rising interest from socially-conscious consumers, some of the 1,200 people at the conference said this had made explaining their work even harder.Cassandra Staff, chief operating officer at Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship, a US-based training scheme at Santa Clara University, said as social entrepreneurship became trendy, there was more confusion about its definition.“There has been a lot of conflation within the definition as it has become more trendy, and fragmentation as everyone tries to work out what it means to them,” she said.The Big Issue Group, one of Britain’s leading social enterprises tackling homelessness by producing and selling street newspapers, regularly gets mistaken for a charity, said Nigel Kershaw, its executive chairman.“It’s often an assumption when you are doing something for the people and the planet you must be a charity,” said Kershaw on the sidelines of the Skoll Forum.He explained this created a problem because the Big Issue aimed to build self esteem in the homeless vendors who sell its magazine. If it gave money to them instead, like a charity, it would be “perpetuating a dependency”.Precious Lunga, co-founder of London and Nairobi-based Baobab Circle – which uses mobile and artificial intelligence technology to improve healthcare – said investors tend to see social enterprises as a charity while users viewed it more as a business.“There is no collective understanding about what a social enterprise is because it encompasses a wide range of types of organisations from non-profit to for-profit,” she said.“Many of my contemporaries see themselves as entrepreneurs first.” — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/as-flying-shame-grips-sweden-sas-ups-stakes-in-climate-battle/,"As ‘flying shame’ grips Sweden, SAS ups stakes in climate battle",Airlines,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"STOCKHOLM: In the country that gave the world teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, shame connected with travelling on airplanes that guzzle fossil fuels may now be having a real impact on travel patterns.
Swedavia AB, which operates 10 Swedish airports including the ones outside Stockholm and Gothenburg, has seen year-on-year passenger numbers drop for seven consecutive months. Last year, Sweden had its weakest overall growth in passenger numbers in a decade.
At the same time, passenger numbers at state train operator SJ jumped to a record 32 million last year due to “the big interest in climate-smart travel.”
The phenomenon, known as “flying shame,” is putting pressure on airlines to up efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
SAS AB’s Scandinavian Airlines is taking a series of measures, including replacing older airplane models with more fuel-efficient ones, and seeking to use more biofuel.
The carrier that’s partly owned by the Swedish and Danish governments is also switching heavy seating for lighter and asking customers to pre-book food. Those steps will reduce the weight of its planes and thereby cut fuel consumption. In addition, it seeks to offset the emissions from flights made by its Eurobonus club members by investing in energy projects that generate a compensation equivalent to the amount of CO2 emitted.
In the past decade, SAS has overhauled one of Europe’s least-efficient aircraft fleets. It phased out fuel-thirsty McDonnell Douglas MD-80 planes and placed orders for Airbus SE’s latest A320neo-series narrow-body as well as the twin-aisle A350-900, which is due to join the fleet this year.
For SAS chief executive officer Rickard Gustafson, the matter is existential. Unless society – and airlines – address climate change, the world as we know it may cease to exist. But as airlines are an integral part of the globalised world we live in, he doesn’t believe the answer is to stop flying. Instead, airlines must take measures to cut pollution and become more sustainable until the day comes when there are engines that don’t rely on fossil fuels.
The issue is rising on the agenda of airlines as customers become more and more climate conscious, particularly in Sweden.
Flying shame, where people feel ashamed to use any mode of transport that uses fossil fuel, is on the rise in Sweden. According to a survey by the World Wildlife Fund, 23% of Swedes have abstained from traveling by air in the past year to reduce their climate impact, up 6 percentage points from a year earlier. Some 18% have chosen to travel by train rather than air.
A separate recent survey by Swedish Radio showed that the climate is the most important political topic for young people today. That development coincides with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg’s movement, where thousands of pupils across the world regularly hold protests to try to force political leaders to take action on the environment. Thunberg travels by train whenever she appears at events in Europe.
In addition to “flygskam” (flying shame), Swedes have adapted to new words describing the shift, including “tagskryt” (train bragging) and “smygflyga,” or fly in secret.
Even Swedavia, the airport operator, seems to be feeling the pressure. In its past two monthly reports on passenger numbers, it included comments on how it is working to become more sustainable. That includes increasing the use of biofuel at its airports and making sure that all Swedavia airports produce zero fossil CO2 emissions from their own operations by 2020.
According to Swedavia, the climate debate is one reason behind its falling passenger numbers, along with factors such as concerns about the Swedish stock and housing markets, a weak Swedish krona, and geopolitical uncertainties. The impact is evident especially on domestic travel, which dropped 3% last year.
For SAS, one of the key measures is to use more biofuel, which unlike fossil fuel has been produced through current biological processes rather than geological processes. Such fuel is considered carbon neutral, as the CO2 absorbed by the plants used to produce it is equal to the gas that’s released when the fuel is burned.
But there is a problem – there just isn’t enough biofuel around. To help solve the supply issue, SAS has teamed up with refinery Preem to increase production of biofuel in Sweden as it seeks to use biofuel corresponding to all its domestic fuel consumption by 2030. That’s part of a broader plan to cut total carbon emissions by 25 percent by 2030 compared to the base year 2005. There is also a cost involved, as biofuel is more expensive than fossil fuel.
Given that passengers appear to becoming more and more climate conscious, airlines may have no choice but to make that switch. They could even become a selling point.
“The journey toward a fossil-free footprint will be long, but I’m a technology optimist,” Gustafson said. “One day a scientist will figure out how to replace the current jet engine, and I think those planes will become available to all of us in, say, 20 years’ time.” — Bloomberg"

Platforms have a longer lifecycle than content. “But at that time, we saw that there weren’t many platforms to support mobile advertisements. “So in 2015, we came up with a mobile advertising platform that helps connect mobile advertisers with quality content producers that have the right database or target audience,” he shares.The move boosted the company’s sales significantly.MCOM’s profit after tax leapt to RM6.6mil in 2017 from RM129,000 the previous year. Revenue doubled to RM16.8mil from RM7.4mil. Last year, the company upgraded its mobile advertising platform to a programmatic platform, which focuses more on data analytics and “real-time costing, accuracy and optimisation”. This, Ho shares, will help the company grow even more. Additionally, MCOM is planning to move into the e-commerce advertising space, which would give it another growth segment to tap into. Ho expects strong revenue growth for this year. “We upgraded our platform and solutions last year. And we will be going more into e-commerce this year, which can give a big boost to revenue. E-commerce has volume so we will see a big jump because of this,” he says. For the seven-months ended July 31, 2018, its profit after tax was RM1.6mil on the back of RM9.6mil in sales. Currently, payment solutions contribute about 80% to its revenue, the bulk of which comes from its overseas market, while its mobile advertising platforms make up the remaining 20%. But moving forward, Ho says its mobile advertising platform business will drive growth for the company. Another growth opportunity for the company will come from Cambodia. In 2016, MCOM secured a 30-year Internet Service Provider licence there to roll out Internet services. “People think we are diverging from our core of mobile advertisements to an Internet service provider. We are not. The core of this project is not to provide Internet connection. It’s about the database,” says MCOM group general manager David Ng. “We want to create our own database. Providing free wifi is an effective way to get a database of users. The Cambodia business will serve as a lead generator for us to create our in-house database. “Cambodia is a booming market. And not a lot of people have tapped into this market’s database yet. So this helps expand our mobile advertising business,” adds Ng.He also notes that Cambodia’s close relationship with China will help develop the market there. If its venture in Cambodia is a success, Ng says the project can serve as a model for its ventures into other markets. MCOM is set for a listing on the LEAP Market to raise funds for its expansion plans. The listing will involve a placement of 18.85 million shares or 10% of the enlarged share capital at an indicative price of 28 sen per share.This will raise about RM5.28mil for the company, of which, RM2.9mil or 54.9% will be used as capital expenditure to set up essential facilities to offer wired and wireless Internet services in Cambodia.  Another portion of the funds will be used to increase automation level in the company’s mobile advertising platform and to enhance its mobile advertising solution infrastructure.Ho says the company will be developing another platform next year for its next phase of growth. “We are going to do a data management platform, where we can analyse all the data that comes in and match customers more effectively. “In the future, there will be more and more data coming in. But you’ll need effective data. So a data management platform will have good potential. “Yes, it’s expensive to develop a platform and it takes a long time. But we want to enhance our products when new technology comes out. But we can’t take too long to develop them. Platforms keep changing. We always need to change. We have to follow the trends to meet market requirements,” says Ho."

Most of the time, food is delivered to your doorstep within 30 minutes of placing an order. 
But professional food delivery businesses, such as Baedal Minjok have a downside. Although such services are popular, they are costly due to the number of deliverymen they need to employ. These expenses usually translate into higher retail prices. 
Overcoming such issues related to cost and efficiency, Seoul-based salad delivery firm Freshcode has deployed what it calls a shared delivery system. It delivers to spots where there is more than a certain number of customers who have banded together to get salads delivered. The routes are navigated based on IT solutions. Last but not least, there is no extra delivery charge. 
“We’re not a food company, we are an IT firm,” Regina Yoo, chief marketing officer and co-founder of the three-year-old startup, told The Investor. 
“That is why we came up with the name Freshcode, a combination of fresh, as in eating fresh, and code, as in computer code.”
The Korean startup sells salads based in a small kitchen from which it rolls out 1,300-2,000 boxes of salad a day. Last month, it won the grand prize at WeWork’s Creator Awards in Seoul, an award competition for startups, non-profit organisations and artists. 
Instead of running salad bars or restaurants, it has some 300 “Freshcode Spots,” where orders are delivered and picked up. 
Operating the Freshcode spots cost, surprisingly, nothing. The spots can be fridges at a company or a cafe. They can be created at the request of customers. Opening a Freshcode spot requires you to gather at least four others – for example, your colleagues or like-minded people online – and then simply place a request on the firm’s webpage. After a screening process, a brand new Freshcode Spot is born.
The ordering process is also quite easy, according to Yoo. Just locate the closest Freshcode Spot, choose a type of salad you want, place an order and then pick it up. Any order placed before 9:30am can be delivered to your pickup place before lunch time.
“From the get-go, we knew we wanted to develop our own website because that way, we can create a flexible ordering system that’s easier for customers to use and gives them more freedom than web portals like Naver or Cafe24,” the chief marketing officer said. 
Freshcode is currently available in Seoul and nearby cities, like Suwon or Pangyo, but it will likely expand to other metropolitan cities in and out of South Korea. 
“Since nearly 80% of the nation’s entire delivery services take place in Seoul and nearby cities, Freshcode is putting more focus on these regions,” said Yoo, who worked for startups in Seoul and San Francisco before founding the firm with chief executive officer Jeong Yoo-seok in 2016.
“We would like to bring the same delivery business model to Busan or even New York,” she added.
Starting a salad business was not actually Yoo’s brainchild. 
After burning out from previous jobs at startups, she had a chance to talk with venture fund Primer chief executive officer Kwon Do-kyoon in San Francisco about her career path. Kwon, a self-proclaimed salad aficionado, recommended starting a salad business and introduced some of his favourite salad places in Golden Gate City.
Jung and Yoo, who have both never been trained in cooking, developed their signature recipes for salads and sauces through trial and error.
“Eating fresh and clean is a trend in Silicon Valley and San Francisco,” said Yoo, “I wanted to bring the culture to South Korea.”
During the Creator Awards event, in which some 700 for-profit startups competed for first place, one of the questions posed to Yoo onstage was whether she thought a box of salad can be considered a substantial meal in the South Korean market, where rice is still a staple food.
The Freshcode co-founder said she believes salad is indeed a substantial meal that is both healthy and nutritious. 
“People used to doubt the success of drinks and food imported from outside Korea, such as Americano, pizza, and hamburgers, but consumers here love them now,” Yoo said. 
The company started with around 100-200 customers and three Freshcode Spots when it launched in October 2016. 
There are now 300 Freshcode Spots serving 30,000 people. Sales have also increased hundredfold in the same period, though the firm declined to reveal exact figures. 
Growth has largely been driven by female customers, but the startup has seen an increasing number of male customers recently. Around 70% of its current customers are female while the rest are men. 
“Men who are on a workout or diet scheme tend to try to eat healthy, so the company is trying to offer different types of salad tailored for them,” she said. 
She forecast that the overall salad market here as well as abroad will continue to grow as people become more aware of what they eat. The Freshcode team aims to ramp up its daily production volume to 10,000 units this year while increasing the number of pickup spots to 1,200.
With the unique shared delivery business model, the company would be able to attain an upper hand in the sector, she said. — The Korea Herald/ANN"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/15/flowering-prosperity-in-yunnan/,Flowering prosperity in Yunnan,SMEBiz,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"TWENTY years ago, the farmers around Yunnan’s Dianchi Lake mostly grew vegetables for sale in local village markets.On the eastern shore of the lake, the Dounan area of Kunming – now the site of the world’s second-largest flower market, after one in the Netherlands – was then a small village.The region has a great climate for growing flowers, but there was no way for the farmers to get these higher-valued but quickly perishable products to markets in the big cities of China, not to speak of foreign markets.Over the last decade, a big investment in infrastructure in this far south-western province has enabled many farmers to roughly double their incomes by switching to flowers. And many entrepreneurs have been able to build flower-related businesses, thus transforming their lives and giving new opportunities to their employees.For example, Yang Fengli, who sells flowers at the Dounan market, says she earns 6,000 yuan (RM3,660) per month, up from 3,000 yuan before she started selling flowers.And, Zhang Guizhen, who is 70 years old, says she has witnessed the transformation of Dounan from rural farmland into a well-known place with tall buildings and people who earn more money.“More people come to Dounan for flowers and our life is much better than before. I earned 30 yuan a day before and now it is 50 yuan,” she said.The Dounan Flower Market, which is similar to the Chicago Commodities Exchange, but for flowers, has both a traditional flower market and an electronic auction business. During the night, the hall is full of wholesalers arranging sales to large buyers in China and overseas. In the daytime, small farmers come in to sell to local Kunming buyers.About 500 people work for the flower market company itself and there are around 3,000 independent traders in the market each day. In 2018, the auction business carried out transactions worth 200 million yuan, according to Zhu Yongmeng, manager of the Dounan Flower Market.Zhang Shaoliang, an auctioneer at the Dounan Electronic Flower Trading Company (DEFTC), says that 1.8 million branches per day, costing 1.5 yuan to 8 yuan each, were sold during the recent peak period leading up to Valentine’s Day.Setting up an electronic auction system is not simple. All the flowers need to be sorted by a standardised measure of quality and by variety. DEFTC has also set up a subsidiary company that handles the technical challenges of processing large numbers of transactions in a very short time, thus creating more high-end jobs, according to Zhu.China’s investment in Yunnan’s infrastructure picked up sharply after 2013 due to the Belt and Road Initiative and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.In 2014, the provincial government announced that 100 billion yuan would be dedicated to building or upgrading 1,500km of highway.In 2016, the national high-speed rail system reached Kunming. In addition, rail lines linking the city to Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar are under construction.By 2018, 5,198km of freeway, 1,026km of high-speed rail, and five logistics hubs had been built. This year, the provincial government plans to accelerate construction of logistics hubs throughout the province.Zhu says the flower business is made possible by the investment in Yunnan’s transportation infrastructure. “The highway transportation system is now built from Kunming to almost everywhere. So, this is a very good chance.“Of course, we use aircraft a lot. And, the high-speed rail is helpful because fresh flowers are very hard to preserve for a longer time. We have good logistics and we ship very fast to other places.“Business and logistics systems are built as a public service. We help the local farmers to sell their flowers.”Many people have been able to build businesses based on the Dounan Flower Market and on Kunming’s position as a logistics hub.For example, Ren Wenbin, who is originally from Xi’an, capital of Shaanxi province, was a factory worker in Guangzhou in 2000, but saw that as a dead-end job. In 2004, he followed relatives to Kunming and was able to start the Yunnan Ruifeng Flower Co Ltd, which now has an annual turnover of 300 million yuan just in Kunming and also has 47 direct sales stores throughout China.He also sells flowers to Thailand, Canada, Singapore, the Philippines, Macao and Hong Kong.“Kunming now has a well-developed logistics system. We can pack flowers at a very fast speed and then logistics companies will make house calls to deliver. Buyers in Hong Kong and Macao can get receipt on the same day,” he said.Yang Daoyin, who is originally from East China’s Anhui province, got started selling buckets of flowers at the railway station in Guangzhou. Because the city officials did not allow small peddlers, he switched to selling on his bicycle. So, when he had saved 3,000 yuan and bought a second-hand mobile phone, he took a train to try his luck in Kunming.Now, he owns 1,500 mu of land (100ha) and co-operates with other local farmers to raise flowers on a further 5,000 mu. He provides the farmers with good-quality seeds and seedlings, and links them to orders from around the world, while the farmers maintain autonomy in managing and planting their land.He expects to double the area planted in two years. He also employs 300 people directly in his factory.Yang said: “Large-scale production, transportation, sales platform construction, e-commerce and the opening of Changshui airport in 2012 have brought flowers in Kunming to a new and international level.“Over the past decade or so, the planting scale became bigger and much more international, to Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Russia and Dubai.“Vietnam and Myanmar can be reached by automobile transportation, and there are specialised logistics companies to transport by air to other countries.“For the last decade, because of the continuous expansion of planting area, the popularisation of cold chain technology and the establishment of professional logistics, neighbouring countries have grown very fond of cheap flowers with stable prices from China.” — China Daily/ANN"

More than 50% of the respondents expect to increase their workforce this year, according to CPA Australia’s 10th annual Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey, which was released last Tuesday. With global economic uncertainty and slowing global growth, this result reflects positively on the capabilities and resilience of China’s small business sector, the survey said.
Derek Chan, president of CPA Australia North China Committee, said that the conditions for small businesses were slightly weaker across the Asia-Pacific region in 2018, with fewer respondents reporting that they grew compared to the previous survey.
“For the Chinese mainland, the result bettered the survey average. About 74% of small businesses from the Chinese mainland state that they grew in 2018, higher than the survey average of 66%,” Chan told reporters. “The positive small business conditions look set to continue into 2019.”
The findings follow extensive surveying of more than 3,600 small business operators in 10 markets, including Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. It was conducted by CPA Australia, one of the world’s largest accounting bodies.
The findings showed increasing costs are one of the most significant barriers to small business in the Chinese mainland. Over 33% of the surveyed businesses identified it as a “key challenge”.
To help ease companies’ burden, China introduced a series of tax reforms since last year, and it plans to reduce the tax burdens and social insurance contributions of enterprises by nearly 2 trillion yuan ($298 billion) this year.
Kevin Ng, member of CPA Australia North China Committee, said: “We believe the government’s further tax cut, together with other measures that will be implemented this year, will help to reduce their cost burden and sharpen their competitiveness in the region. This will stimulate the growth of the broader business sector.”
“Deeper reforms on value added tax, commencing on April 1, will further relieve the pressure on small businesses and boost economic activity,” Ng said.
The survey also found that 34% of Chinese mainland’s businesses expect easy access to finance, higher than the Asia-Pacific average of 23%.
Chan considered the government’s announcement during this year’s two sessions on increasing the availability of finance for small businesses as “timely” measure, which will further improve small businesses’ access to finance.
“Considering the high proportion of small businesses from the Chinese mainland that sell online and utilise other digital technologies, there are opportunities for reputable financial institutions to apply financial technologies and big data analysis to make it easier for small business to access finance,” Chan added.
Li Zibin, president of China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises agreed, citing supply-chain financing as an important tool to improve the access of small companies to raise capital. — China Daily/ANN"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/15/getting-small-merchants-on-the-digital-payment-wagon/,Getting small merchants on the digital payment wagon,SMEBiz,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"SMALLER businesses are often hesitant about new technology mainly due to investment costs and a lack of awareness.So when Axiata Group launched its Boost e-wallet, Axiata Digital Services Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Mohd Khairil Abdullah says it specifically focused on smaller merchants to help them take advantage of the cashless ecosystem. “If you want to be a cashless society, you can’t just focus on the top-tier branded merchants because they already have other payment options like credit cards. You’ve got to focus on the tier-3 and tier-4 merchants.“This technology helps the underserved segment. They were facing a lot of pain points,” he says.Khairil notes, for example, its user base in East Malaysia. “In Sabah and Sarawak, Chinese tourists there have been using Alipay and WeChat wallets. But the locals can’t. So when we introduced Boost there, they thought, ‘great, we can finally do what the tourists are doing’. “So adoption was very high there. We were pleasantly surprised,” he says. He adds that users in Sabah and Sarawak have remained active with weekly usage at 61% and 57% respectively. In comparison, active rate in the central region – where a large part of its users are based and payment options more widely available – is at 15%.Boost claims to be the largest e-wallet in the country.According to Khairil, Boost had 3.8 million registered users and 70,000 merchants as at end-February. And the numbers, he adds, are growing rapidly.About two-thirds of its merchant base are made up of smaller businesses such as food hawkers, food trucks and pasar malam vendors. He notes that most of these vendors did not previously have alternative payment options aside from cash. The introduction of e-wallets to these businesses enable them to tap a wider base of customers. “We have been aggressively acquiring merchants so that consumers can use Boost anywhere,” he says. One of them is Raymond Teh, the owner of Fresh Garden, a fruit store in Serdang.Last May, Teh made Boost available as a payment option for his customers and has received positive feedback from them.“It was easy for us to push this as a payment option to our customers. There are transactions with Boost every day,” says Teh.About 20% of payments at Fresh Garden is done through e-wallets, the bulk over Boost. Teh notes that it is an easier payment option to implement as there are no merchant charges or lengthy registration process. It also makes it easier to upsell customers, he says.Meanwhile, for Petaling Jaya-based pasar malam vendor, Passion Hot Bun owner Ken Lee, the use of e-wallets has helped overcome a lot of his pain points. Lee was introduced to Boost about a year ago when Boost agents approached the traders community to give the e-wallet a try. Most of the younger vendors were quick on the uptake. Among them, was Lee. “There are a lot of advantages to using it. We don’t need to calculate or return change to the customers, and there is no risk of getting counterfeit money or theft. Also, on rainy days, paper money tend to stick together, so we could lose money.“Consumers like it because they can get cashback. So we get repeated customers. The more they transact, the more cashback rewards they get. And when there is a queue in front of your store, it attracts more new customers,” he says. Boost is looking into more bundled propositions that would include offerings from these smaller merchants to help them increase transactions. This could be done through targeted campaigning to consumers.“We will continue to invest in innovating new products, and on consumer and merchant education and incentives,” says Khairil.The growth of Boost in the e-wallet segment has also enabled the group to roll out other banking-type services such as micro-insurance and financing for its merchants. “In Indonesia and some parts of Malaysia, we’ve launched some form of micro-insurance and financing for merchants, and this is done via our sister company in the group. “After they have done enough transactions, (there is a track record and) we can give them loans. We’ve dished out a number of loans. In Malaysia, we’ve given out about 5,000 loans with an average ticket size of about RM3,500. The average ticket size of loans in Indonesia is US$61. They are very small,” he says.It is also working with businesses in Indonesia to provide them with supply chain payments, which could also be expanded to Malaysia. Another service that Boost provides is micro-insurance for smaller items such as generators and smartphones, which are important devices for small merchants. “So we’ve built businesses around that (the e-wallet) to support the merchants,” he says.Boost currently operates e-wallets in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia and Khairil is confident that there is only upside potential for its business. He welcomes more players into the market as that would help with consumer and merchant education. “When we first launched in October 2017, it was hard to get the market to accept Boost. The turning point came when other competitors started coming in around mid-2018. That’s when we saw our numbers grew. They helped make up the hype. “So, the more, the merrier. Our user base grew six times last year. This year, we can quite easily move to 5 million,” he adds. However, he thinks the market will eventually stabilise with three to five large players with interoperable wallets and a few more niche providers with limited-use e-wallets.Khairil believes its success will depend on its ability to create a landscape that is easy for consumers and merchants.He is aiming to have half of Boost’s base to be active daily users by 2021."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/its-too-calm-for-us-rates-investors-to-let-their-guard-down/,It’s too calm for US rates investors to let their guard down,Markets,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"NEW YORK: Long lunches and scenic walks may beckon US traders this week following the recent sprint, but they’ll relax at their own risk.
Sure, the US calendar of events is sparse. And despite a flood of news, last week was actually pretty boring, with 10-year Treasury yields moving only about 7 basis points, an average weekly move for 2019. But given the fragile state of the global economy, investors may find more to trade this week in China’s retail sales and eurozone consumer prices than in the marquee American report on industrial production.
Moreover, focusing on the subdued volatility trend makes it easy to forget that over the past three years Treasury yields have covered a lot of ground, often quickly, said Robert Tipp of PGIM Fixed Income, a US$716bil money manager.
“With all the confusion in the markets, along with the fundamental economic and policy uncertainty, that pattern should continue: alternating periods of range-bound noise, and jarring, significant shifts,” the chief investment strategist said.
Volatility has subsided from a late-March surge, as recent economic data have eased fears of a recession in the US. The Federal Reserve has stuck to its script that it’s on hold, and this week’s Fed speakers are unlikely to stray far from a message that’s comforted markets. But that confidence depends to a large extent on other global growth engines not failing and turning a cyclical US slowdown into something worse.
“What would trigger volatility is any change in the potential growth or inflation backdrop, whether that’s the US or in the global market,” said Alexander Dryden, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.
In his view, the lock-step movement of German and US benchmark yields is evidence of how closely tied their economic fortunes are right now. An updraft in the German 10-year yield on Friday helped lift the US counterpart to a three-week high of 2.57%. This strong correlation would continue “because their economic trajectories are so interlinked at the moment,” he said.
For this holiday-shortened week, Dryden thinks Wednesday’s European consumer price index data could be surprising. He sees potential for a pickup that could bring an European Central Bank rate hike back in play around year-end and prompt a knee-jerk jump in yields. That said, he believes that the 10-year Treasury yields will only start to trend higher in the second half of the year, and then only gradually, to around 2.6%. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/reliance-no-waiver-on-tax-dues/,Reliance: No waiver on tax dues,Business News,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Communications Ltd has denied it received favourable treatment by France in settling a tax dispute at a time when it was negotiating to become Dassault Aviation SA’s partner for a contract to sell fighter jets to India.
The Indian company, owned by former billionaire Anil Ambani, issued the denial after Le Monde newspaper reported on Saturday that four years ago France dropped a demand for about US$159mil in taxes owed by Reliance’s subsidiary in Europe.
The unit, Reliance Flag, “settled all disputes as per legal framework available to all companies in France,” a company spokesman said in a statement on Saturday, denying any “favouritism or gain from the settlement.”
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facing voters in a contest for re-election, is under pressure amid allegations by opposition lawmakers that his government scrapped a 126-jet deal negotiated by the previous Congress-led administration, and acquired 36 fighter jets at a higher price. 
They also allege that the government forced Dassault to partner with Reliance for the additional investments necessary for India to award the purchase to the French firm. Ambani and the Modi government have denied all allegations of wrongdoing.
Aman Anand, a spokesman for India’s defense ministry, said any connection drawn between the tax issue and the fighter-jet contract “is totally inaccurate, tendentious and is a mischievous attempt to disinform.”
According to Le Monde, which cited an auditor’s report from January 2015, Reliance Flag Atlantic France SAS saw two tax adjustments for the period between 2007 and 2012, which it contested. Tax authorities notably objected to the way the company accounted for purchases from other Reliance units, the newspaper said. 
The authorities finally reached a deal in 2015 that saw the company pay about 7 million euros (US$7.9mil), instead of the 151 million euros they initially demanded, Le Monde said.
“This settlement was conducted in full adherence with the legislative and regulatory framework governing this common practice of the tax administration. It was not subject to any political interference whatsoever,” Alexandre Ziegler, ambassador of France to India, said via Twitter posts on Saturday evening.
Reliance Flag owns a terrestrial cable network and other telecom infrastructure in France. Between 2008 and 2012, it made an operating loss of 200 million rupees, and the French tax authorities issued a demand of more than 11 billion rupees, the company said in the statement. 
A mutual settlement agreement was signed and the company paid 560 million rupees as per the French law, it said.
The French tax authorities declined to comment on the decision to waive the tax bill when contacted by Le Monde, the newspaper reported, adding Francois Hollande, who was French president at the time, was not aware of the matter.
A spokesman for France’s budget ministry didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg message seeking comment.
India’s top court this week said it would review fresh evidence in the purchase of French warplanes. It had previously rejected a plea and said the individual petitioner’s doubts were not enough to prompt a probe into the US$8.7bil aircraft purchase. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/tensions-rise-with-endless-tariffs/,Tensions rise with endless tariffs,Economy,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"GLOBAL cooperation, crucial in times of weakening growth, has taken a step back with the threat of US$11bil worth of US retaliatory tariffs on European goods.
With possible US tariffs on European cars and auto parts already stoking a lot of tension; this potential salvo from the US, aimed against European Union (EU) subsidies on Airbus, makes it worse.
These tariff threats on the EU are delivered just as the US is said to be finalising a trade deal with China, which has purportedly agreed on many sticking points that it had previously not budged on.
There is no respite for the global economy. Europe’s economy is weakening even as China’s is said to be showing fragile signs of recovery.
President Donald Trump had launched an aggressive tariff campaign against China, which had a US$323.32bil trade surplus in 2018 with the US.
While China has a strong pipeline of stimulus measures to counter the slowdown, the European Central Bank is said to have “little left in the tank.”
Europe, with among its largest economies – Germany, France and Italy – in trouble, is increasingly seen as the biggest threat to global growth.
We do not need a trade war to add to the risks; the EU is already threatening to retaliate against US subsidies to Boeing. 
With Boeing’s 737 Max planes being grounded worldwide, this places more pressure on the US and further complicates the situation.
The amount of EU products to be tariffed by the US is 1/30th of that involved in the US-China trade war, but European leaders warn of a further dent to confidence that will, in turn, snowball into further slowing of growth.
Possible auto tariffs will not only hit the EU but countries from South Korea to Eastern Europe, that export and assemble cars bound for the US as well as supply parts to car companies in the US.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned that the damage wreaked by potential auto tariffs can be far more costly than that caused by the US-China trade war.
At this “delicate” time of economic slowdown where many nations are grappling with high debts, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has cautioned against “self-inflicted wounds” that include tariffs and other barriers.
This flare-up in tariff issues does not just involve China and Europe, but also Japan, India and several other countries.
Besides tariff tensions, other factors like the economic outlook of the US, the growth of the Chinese economy, and global markets which remain fragile and volatile, would also impact global growth, said Anthony Dass, head of AmBank Research.
The slowing global economy is susceptible to multi-faceted risks that include the direction of monetary policy, trade tensions, debt, policy risk as in Brexit and geopolitical risks.
“Any of these risks can cause a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global growth, a negative turn in sentiment that would undermine confidence and wide swings in capital flows,’’ said Lee Heng Guie, executive director at Socio Economic Research Centre.
China’s exports in March grew 14.2% compared with a drop of 20.8% in February, amidst suggestions that export subsidies had helped in the rebound.
But any strong rebound in Chinese exports is not expected, in view of weak global growth while a contraction in imports is raising concerns of slower consumer demand in China.
The US economy is viewed to be “in a good place,” the main reason could be due to the rebound in stock prices, said former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
This tends to spur growth; a rise of 10% in the S&P 500 contributes to a 1% increase in real gross domestic product. In the long run, the US economy will be impacted as “the rest of the world is sinking.” 
US consumer sentiment has dipped, with The University of Michigan’s preliminary survey sliding to 96.9 in April against 98.4 in March.
The index of consumer expectations for the future fell to the lowest in more than a year, to 85.8 from 88.8 in March.
This constant imposition of tariffs is reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which increased import tariffs by 40%, causing retaliation and a drastic drop in international trade.
The raising of tariffs to protect US businesses and farmers caused additional strain to the already depressed global climate of the Great Depression.
“When difficulties arise, it will be every country for itself. Similar to the Smoot-Hawley Act, after a spell of poor economic performance, the US is tempted to think it can steal a march on its trade partners by imposing tariffs on them,’’ said Pong Teng Siew, head of research at Inter-Pacific Securities.
Columnist Yap Leng Kuen notes that some may be “tariff happy,” but they should “do no harm.”"

Speaking to reporters at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings in Washington, Draghi said on Saturday he was “certainly worried about central bank independence” and especially “in the most important jurisdiction in the world.”Draghi’s intervention is notable given central bankers are usually loath to comment on politics or events in economies other than their own. He was later seen in conversation in the IMF’s headquarters with Fed chairman Jerome Powell, who Trump has frequently accused of not doing enough to stoke the US economy.How free central banks are from political meddling has been a key theme on the sidelines of the IMF talks, which took place as Trump looks to nominate two political loyalists to the Fed’s board of governors: former pizza executive Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Politicians from Turkey to India have also been accused of seeking to sway their monetary policy makers in the hope they will act to spur demand. The risk is investors begin to doubt the dedication of such authorities to fighting inflation, pushing up market interest rates and potentially sapping the growth that governments want to see.
“If the central bank is not independent then people may well think that monetary policy decisions follow political advice rather than objective assessment of the economic outlook,” Draghi said. “Central banks ought to be left free to choose what is the best way to comply with” their mandates.
Also on Saturday, when asked at a press briefing about the Fed candidates and other pressures on central banks, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said that for such institutions, “independence has served them well over the course of time and hopefully will continue to do so.”
South African Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago and Swiss National Bank president Thomas Jordan both made the point that central banks are already held accountable by virtue of the goals they are set by legislatures. — Bloomberg"

The worst is over,” he told Bernama during his visit to the news agency’s headquarters recently.For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), TH recorded a high deficit (total liabilities exceeded total assets) of RM10.9bil, up from RM4.1bil registered as at Dec 31, 2017.In efforts to restore a financial position that is more balanced, TH has implemented a turnaround and rehabilitation programme for underperforming assets (equities and properties), worth RM9.7bil currently.These assets have been transferred to a special purpose vehicle wholly-owned by the government, Urusharta Jemaah Sdn Bhd, at a price of RM19.9bil in exchange for two sukuk valued at RM10bil and RM9.6bil respectively, with returns of 4.05% and 4.1% (RM800mil a year).Following this, TH has successfully recorded an asset surplus of RM1bil after registering total assets of RM76.5bil against total liabilities of RM75.5bil.This has enabled the organisation to pay a dividend distribution of 1.25% involving a payout of RM913mil to all its depositors for FY18.Zukri said the balance totalling RM87mil was put into a newly created reserves account, Hibah Equalisation Reserve, as a precautionary move in facing any emergencies in the future.“If later on we have a short of profit, (we can utilise) this account (as it) is distributable. We will maintain it in a liquid form.“There is no fixed amount for time being but we will have a policy on this, where we are looking at 2%-3% to put aside...let the board decide later,” he explained.Zukri has given the assurance that no shocking announcements would be made after this because all allocation for impairments on investments valued at RM1.5bil had been made last year.He said the periodical financial reports for every quarter of the year would be made to ensure depositors would be informed of TH’s financial position and operations to uphold transparency and accountability.“The balance sheet that TH has right now comprises very good assets. The future of Tabung Haji is bright. (What we have to do is) do not mess up another round.“We should be in a much better position to pay competitive hibah for 2019 and going forward. I’m optimistic it will be more than 1.25%,” he added. — Bernama"

On the lower-end segment, meanwhile, the Honda BR-V (RM80,000 to RM90,000) also has a higher price tag compared with the Aruz (RM73,000 to RM78,000).”The research house said the market share of local marques, compared with foreign makes, stood at 56% to 44% in the first two months of 2019. Perodua’s sales were also boosted by its all-new Myvi.In light of the steady demand for Proton and Perodua vehicles, Kenanga Research has revised upwards its 2019 total industry volume (TIV) forecast to 600,000 units from 590,000 units previously.The strong consumer demand for competitively priced SUVs has resulted in many rival foreign marques struggling to make sales this year, with a select number of car companies predicting a drastic slowdown following the three-month tax holiday period in 2018.A spokesperson from a Europe-based car company who requested anonymity said vehicle sales dropped significantly after the tax holiday period ended.“Sales in February this year were one of the worst we had seen in years. We are expecting sales in the first quarter itself to be quite challenging,” he said.  Demand for cars surged immediately last year when the government announced that there would be a three-month tax holiday from June 1 to Aug 31, with the goods and services tax being zero-rated during the period.One industry observer said the tax holiday resulted in a sudden surge for orders that was “difficult to keep up with”.“Many people wanted to take advantage of the tax exemption. Even individuals that were not planning to buy cars ended up getting one anyway. It was a mad rush!”Kenanga Research said there was tepid demand post the zero-rated holiday, in the fourth quarter of 2018.“Overall, we saw weaker performance in the fourth quarter of 2018, except for Perodua-linked companies, as expected, due to the higher base in the third quarter of 2018 which was boosted by the tail-end of the zero-rated tax holiday.”February 2019 TIV decreased marginally by 1.8% year-on-year to 39,800 units, dragged by weaker sales from foreign carmakers.  Affin Hwang Capital said the 17.8% month-on-month decline was expected, attributable to a shorter working month in conjunction with the Chinese New Year festive holidays.“All in, the two-month TIV units are broadly within our 2019 full-year estimates of 603,000 units,” it said.The TIV for the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be announced later this month by the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA).  At its biannual media briefing in January, the association said 2018 vehicle sales grew 3.8% to 598,714 units, exceeding its forecast of 1.5%.On the sales trend for 2019, MAA president Datuk Aishah Ahmad said the government’s delay in approving new car models’ pricing has negatively affected carmakers’ plans to launch new models.The delay, in turn, is expected to take a toll on the overall sales of new vehicles this year."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/ishsal-no-intention-to-profit-from-5g/,Ishsal: No intention to profit from 5G,Telcos,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The government has no plans to profit from award of the 5G spectrum, according to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) chairman Al-Ishsal Ishak.
Such a policy would be a major shift from the past as telecoms players, which had to pay big sums of money to use spectrum for their services, may not be overcharged for usage. In turn, consumers should benefit from such a move.
“One important principle is (that) the government does not intend to profit from any spectrum exercise,’’ Ishsal said in reply to queries from StarBiz.
“It is a critical and valuable national resource that must benefit the nation from a variety of facets based on principles of providing pervasive, high-quality and affordable access to industry and society,’’ he added, but did not elaborate.
Players had been paying a paltry sum for spectrum but things changed in 2016. The government had raised RM3bil in refarming 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bandwidths.
With the new policy, MCMC is essentially setting a new benchmark to help the industry leap frog into 5G services. 5G is a technology that promises fast speed and connections. It opens the world for smart cities, driverless cars, improved health care and a fully-realised Internet-of-things.
5G is said to revolutionise the entire industries and the way people live, work and play. 
Besides the 5G spectrum needed to fuel 5G enabled networks, players also want the 700MHz bandwidth. Some refarming of 2.3MHz and 2.6MHz can be expected.
Globally, governments have raked in billions of dollars in spectrum sales. The recent 5G auction in Germany drew criticisms as bids reached 5bil. This could result in higher overall cost of bringing 5G to that market.
“The best practice is that spectrum needs to be priced appropriately. I would be worried to see high spectrum prices. There needs to be a balance between economic growth and bringing services to the market,’’ said Ericsson Malaysia president Todd Ashton.
Any spectrum award should be done in a “fair and transparent manner.’’
“There should be no room for preferential treatment to any player as done in the past. Only deserving ones should get the spectrum,’’ an industry expert said.
The earliest any spectrum for 5G can be given could be later this year.
Ishsal is looking at commercial roll-outs of 5G in Malaysia in 2021/2022.
South Korea became the first in Asia to roll out 5G enabled services over a week ago, ahead of Japan and China. The United States rolled out its 5G services last year.
Maxis Bhd  chief technology officer Morten Bangsgaard said there were factors that would determine when the country would enjoy 5G.
“Firstly, you need to be ready for the high capacity demand. Secondly, you need new spectrum allocated for 5G and the price of devices to come down. 
“So, 2019 will be a year of testing the technology and we likely won’t see any real roll-out until 2020 or 2021,’’ he said.
However, the question is whether Malaysia will use the 3.5GHz and 28GHz bands similar to that used by most global players or make compromises. 
This is because the 3.5GHz band is occupied by Measat and some other satellite players.
It is important to know that global chip and handset makers are building on the 3.5GHz platform to create innovations and devices.
Ishsal said “before any spectrum band for 5G use is identified (including 3.5GHz), thorough investigation and analysis must be done. This is to ensure coexistence and compatibility between 5G and existing services. Japan and few other countries have demonstrated coexistence was possible,’’
He added that “such a study was important to identify the appropriate measures to mitigate potential interference as well as to develop solutions to address key issues such as frequency re-planning and migration of existing users, if necessary, across all affected bands, not just 3.5GHz.’’
How much spectrum is enough for each player?
Ashton is looking at blocks of 100MHz to 200MHz.
Celcom Axiata Bhd CEO Idham Nawawi said “5G technology needs much larger blocks of contiguous spectrum; it is likely going to be in blocks of 100MHz or several 100MHz, as opposed to current generation which typically comes in blocks of 10MHz or 20MHz.’’
Ishsal, quoting the GSMA report ,said the proposal is 80MHz to 100MHz of contiguous spectrum per operator.
Whatever the amount, players are excited about this new technology as it can do a lot more.
“We are actively exploring 5G’s potential to drive Malaysia’s digital future. Broad collaboration between governments and businesses is required to make this happen. We are working closely with the MCMC and industry partners to test user cases, conduct field trials and explore modes of 5G implementation,’’ Digi.Com Bhd  CEO Albern Murty said.
Cost will also be a consideration not just for spectrum but network build-up and  products.
“We believe each player needs to invest about RM700mil to RM1bil each year in the initial years provided they have a solid 4G base network,’’ said an expert.
Ashton added that “the one fundamental building block for 5G is that players need a very good 4G layer.’’
Idham said, as an industry, they must “explore new ways of deploying our investments in a more efficient way.’’
He expected more collaborations between industry players to manage cost, which ultimately would lead to 5G services becoming more affordable to the customers.
Morten added that “what is new and really exciting about 5G is how you see co-innovation between enterprises, operators, the government and device manufacturers. Because it is a new and more efficient technology, it will help operators to cater to and build that capacity to support demand.”
For smooth transition into 5G, MCMC has set up a taskforce in November to explore every aspect. On Thursday, 10 parties will showcase innovations in Putrajaya."

The S&P 500 is now within a percent of September's record closing high, and the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which includes reinvested dividends, in fact regained record levels, recovering ground lost after a punishing sell-off in the closing months of the year which brought the benchmark index within a rounding error of bear market territory.

Since then, the three major indexes notched their best quarterly gains in nearly a decade in the first quarter, but have spent April in a holding pattern ahead of first-quarter earnings season.

JPMorgan, effectively jump-starting the quarterly earnings reporting season that will dominate investor sentiment in coming weeks, blew past analyst estimates, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results. Its stock rose 4.7% and led a broad rally in bank stocks.

""JPMorgan earnings are important because their operation touches on a wide portion of the economy,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""It's a bellwether for other corporate earnings.""

Analyst now expect S&P 500 companies to show a 2.3% year-on-year decline in earnings, slightly improved from their last reading, per Refinitiv data. But first-quarter profit is still seen logging its first annual contraction since 2016.

However, of the 29 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported thus far, 79.3% have come in above analyst expectations.

Walt Disney Co jumped 11.5% to an all-time high, providing the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500 after pricing its upcoming streaming service.

Streaming rival Netflix Inc slid 4.5%.

The Nasdaq and the Dow are both about 1.5% below their previous record highs.

For the week, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq showed their third straight gains, while the Dow posted a nominal weekly loss.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 269.25 points, or 1.03%, to 26,412.3, the S&P 500 gained 19.09 points, or 0.66%, to 2,907.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.81 points, or 0.46%, to 7,984.16.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare ended the session in positive territory.

Financials were the largest percentage gainer, rising 1.9% on the back of JPMorgan Chase earnings.

Healthcare stocks extended their slide, with UnitedHealth Group down 5.2%, Anthem Inc dropping 8.5% and Humana Inc off 2.8%. The S&P 500 Healthcare index slipped 1.0%.

In the largest energy deal since 2016, Chevron Corp said it would buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $33 billion in cash and stock.

Chevron's stock dipped by 4.9% following the announcement, while Anadarko shot up 32.0%.

Boeing Co rose 2.6% as the plane maker's stock recovered ground following its recent sell-off.

The CBOE Volatility Index - Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge"" slipped to a fresh six-month low on Friday, in a sign investors expect the good times to keep rolling.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

IMF loans, issued to Greece as part of the country's bailouts since 2010, cost Athens around 5 percent annually and are now more expensive than financing in the market, where 10-year benchmark bonds trade at around 3.3 percent .

""The IMF repayment will be agreed on this weekend,"" the senior official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington.

The official said Germany and the Netherlands were resisting the move, worried the IMF would want to withdraw from the periodical reviews of Greek reforms by its lenders, but would not derail the move.

""They're getting reassurances that the IMF will remain part of the review, so they'll drop it. They’ll repay about half, between 4-5 billion (euros),"" the official said.

The euro zone bailout fund, which under the rules would have to be repaid the same amount, is likely to waive this right, content with Greece's improved debt sustainability that such an operation would produce, the fund's chief Klaus Regling said last week.

Reuters reported on April 3 that Greece was considering a bond issue in late June to raise money for the repayment.

Greece, the euro zone's most indebted state with a debt load equivalent to 180 percent of annual output, must repay about 9.3 billion euros of loans to the IMF by 2024.

That debt carries rates of up to 5 percent, compared to about 0.9 percent for loans from euro zone governments through the bailout fund.

Greece has received more than 280 billion euros from its euro zone partners and the IMF since 2010. It has repaid more than 15 billion euros of short-dated loans to the IMF since 2010.

Athens has a cash chest of more than 27 billion euros from money raised from markets and unused bailout loans. That amount would suffice to keep it afloat up to 2021 without raising fresh cash from markets. - Reuters"

Liu's comments, which Chinese media said were posted on his personal WeChat feed on Friday, are the latest contribution to a growing discussion about work-life balance in the tech industry as the sector slows after years of breakneck growth.

They also come amid reports this week that the company is in the throes of widespread layoffs. Three company sources told Reuters that cuts began earlier this year and had become more extensive in recent weeks.

A JD.com spokesman confirmed the authenticity of Liu's note. He declined to comment on layoffs but said some adjustments were happening as a normal part of business.

""JD.com is a competitive workplace that rewards initiative and hard work, which is consistent with our entrepreneurial roots,"" the spokesman said. ""We're getting back to those roots as we seek, develop and reward staff who share the same hunger and values.""

Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, in the note spoke about how in the firm's earliest days he would set his alarm clock to wake him up every two hours to ensure he could offer his customers 24-hour service - a step he said was crucial to JD's success.

""JD in the last four, five years has not made any eliminations, so the number of staff has expanded rapidly, the number of people giving orders has grown and grown, while the those who are working have fallen,"" Liu wrote. ""Instead, the number of slackers has rapidly grown!""

""If this carries on, JD will have no hope! And the company will only be heartlessly kicked out of the market! Slackers are not my brothers!"" he added

The term he used, which is commonly translated in China as ""slackers"" can be directly translated as people who drift along aimlessly or waste time.

The contents of his note were reported by major Chinese media outlets such as financial magazine Caijing and the 21st Century Herald newspaper on Saturday as well as widely shared on Twitter-like platform Weibo, where it was read more than 400 million times.

CUTS AND SLOWDOWN

Three JD employees, who declined to be named as they were not permitted to speak to the media, told Reuters that morale at the company was low after several senior executive departures and layoffs across the firm in recent weeks. One said the cuts also affected vice-president level staff.

Tech website The Information reported this week that JD.com could cut up to 8 percent of its workforce. JD, which had more than 178,000 full-time employees at the end of last year, said the figure was incorrect.

""Now is kind of an inflection point, where too many people and too many business leaders or department leaders have been laid off. No one is safe,"" one of the sources said.

He added that it had affected productivity in his department and that many workers checked Weibo, the stock markets or played games rather than focus on work.

The layoffs ""are pretty much all JD employees can talk about,"" he said.

The JD spokesman, when asked about morale, said most of the team was highly committed.

""Change - while uncomfortable for some - can be encouraging for most, who are dedicated to our shared future.""

JD, which is backed by Walmart Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and China's Tencent Holdings, in February posted its lowest quarterly revenue growth rate since its 2015 initial public offering.

Other Chinese tech giants have lowered growth forecasts and cut staff bonuses amid the slowdown, which has driven calls for better work conditions for its workers.

The '996' work schedule, which refers to a 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. workday, six days a week, has in particular become the target of online debate and protests on some coding platforms, where workers have swapped examples of excessive overtime demands at some firms.

Alibaba Group founder and billionaire Jack Ma also weighed in on Friday, telling the company's employees in a speech that the opportunity to work such hours was a ""blessing"".

Liu said JD did not force its staff to work the ""996"" or even a ""995"" overtime schedule.

""There is a dilemma. What should we do with OPEC: should we lose the market, which is being occupied by the Americans, or quit the deal?"" Anton Siluanov, speaking in Washington, said, TASS reported.

""(If the deal is abandoned) the oil prices will go down, then the new investments will shrink, American output will be lower, because the production cost for shale oil is higher than for traditional output.""

Siluanov said oil prices could drop to $40 per barrel or even less for up to one year.

The minister said there had been no decision on the deal yet and he did not know whether OPEC countries would be happy with this scenario.

OPEC, Russia and other producers, an alliance known as OPEC+, are reducing output by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 for six months. They meet on June 25-26 to decide whether to extend the pact.

The combined supply cuts have helped to drive a 32 percent rally in crude prices this year to nearly $72 a barrel, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to call on OPEC to ease its market-supporting efforts. OPEC has said the curbs must remain, but there are signs that stance is now softening.

Earlier this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that OPEC could raise oil output from July if Venezuelan and Iranian supply drops further and prices keep rallying, because extending production cuts with Russia and other allies could overtighten the market. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/14/wall-st-week-ahead-industrials-gains-put-to-test-as-earnings-ramp-up/,Wall St week ahead: Industrials' gains put to test as earnings ramp up,Markets,"Sunday, 14 Apr 2019",6:44 PM MYT,"NEW YORK: Investors betting on industrial stocks this year have been rewarded, with the group among the best-performing sectors so far, but that strength will be tested in the coming weeks as companies report results.

Industrials have outperformed the broader market this year, thanks in part to optimism that the United States may soon have a trade deal with China, as well as expectations the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again any time soon.

As first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies ramp up, investors will hear from Honeywell International, Union Pacific Corp. and Kansas City Southern next week.

The S&P 500 industrials index is up more than 19% for the year so far, compared with a roughly 15% gain in the S&P 500.

While industrial stocks and the rest of the market have risen on hopes that a China trade deal is near, excecutives have warned about the conflict's impact, with the industrials space seen as one of the most sensitive.

Costs for certain raw materials have increased as the United States imposed tariffs on imports from China and other countries.

Investors will likely hear more this earnings period about the effects of the tariffs, and weakness in China and the rest of the global economy, on U.S. companies.

""Industrials and tech have been two of the sectors that have called out the risks from trade frequently on earnings calls,"" said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.

""Some of them have seen valuations or estimates come down substantially on those risks."" Because of that, industrial companies could have further to gain if there is a trade deal or any reversal to existing tariffs, she said. The bank has an overweight rating on industrials this year.

The sector has continued to outperform even with problems for one of its leaders. Boeing shares were pummelled last month after its popular 737 MAX jet was involved in a second fatal crash and the aircraft was grounded worldwide.

Results and comments from Boeing, airlines and aerospace suppliers also are likely to generate investor attention.

Wall Street analysts have been trying to gauge the financial hit to Boeing since the March deadly plane crash in Ethiopia.

At the same time, Southwest Airlines Co has cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes out of service, and United Airlines has said it would see an adverse effect on its operations if the jets remained grounded heading into the peak summer travel season.

""There's certainly risk at companies that sell into Boeing planes, although what we're hearing is Boeing hasn't so far cut back on any supplier orders. That could be in second-quarter forecasts,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

Boeing's results are due April 24. Lockheed Martin and other aerospace and defense names are due the same week.

Those bullish on the industrials sector also argue that its valuation remains attractive despite this year's strong gains.

The S&P 500 industrial index is trading at 15.9 times forward 12-month earnings, still among the lowest of the 11 S&P sector and below the benchmark S&P 500's 16.8 price-to-earnings ratio, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

First-quarter earnings for the sector are expected to have increased just 1.6% from a year earlier, though that's better than the expected 2.3% decline in overall S&P 500 earnings, based on Refinitiv's data.

Analysts see General Electric Co. as the largest drag on the industrials sector's first-quarter earnings, based on Refinitiv's data. If GE's results are removed, the sector's earnings are expected to have increased 4.0%. GE is due to report April 30.

Year-over-year quarterly revenue for industrials is forecast to have gained 2.9% versus a 4.9% increase expected for the S&P 500.- Reuters"

The deal announcement, two weeks after Publicis confirmed talks about the purchase, bolsters efforts by the world's third-ranked advertiser to adapt to a fast-changing market increasingly driven by online client data.

""The addition of Epsilon will propel Publicis as a leader of data-driven personalised experiences at scale,"" the Paris-based company said in its statement.

Publicis and other traditional advertisers have been losing ground in a marketplace increasingly dominated by Facebook, Google and digital marketing specialists that track and target individual clients via their smartphones.

The French group's shares sagged after a fourth-quarter earnings miss in February and have fallen 15 percent in total over the past 12 months.

The Epsilon purchase is ""a very significant investment for a company of our size"", Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun said. ""But we're convinced it's the right move ... in a world where data is at the heart of all decisions and the mobile phone has become our main interface.""

Epsilon, which brings a trove of data on some 160 million individual clients, generated revenue of $1.9 billion last year, almost entirely in the United States.

The $4.4 billion cash price amounts to $3.95 billion excluding tax, or 8.2 times Epsilon's 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Publicis said.

The French company said it would cancel a previously announced share buyback and finance the Epsilon deal with debt, adding that the acquisition would be earnings- and cash flow-accretive from next year onwards.  - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/15/not-just-another-coat/,Not just another coat,SMEBiz,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"THE South-East Asian region will provide Tevo Creations Sdn Bhd with plenty of opportunities as the company looks to expand its presence in emerging markets, where there are fewer suppliers of nano-coating paint.
Executive director Kern Ng is eyeing countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Myanmar.
He thinks that the growing construction industry in the region will help the nano-coatings company grow.
Established in 2014, Tevo Creations currently manufactures surface protection nano-coatings in liquid form for the automotive, building and consumer segments.
It has come a long way from when it was just a supplier.
“We started out as Mega Wijaya Sdn Bhd, a supplier of chemicals to electronic, rubber gloves, water treatment, textile, food and beverage, and personal care companies,” Ng shares.
But Ng, who is one of the founders of the company, notes that it needed to do something more to stand out.
“To enhance our competitive edge, we sourced for special chemicals used in niche markets.
“It was then that we discovered nano-science and the solutions that nano-particles can provide.
“The business was very attractive as there were no producers of nano-coating in Malaysia then,” he elaborates.

 
Established brand: Tevo Creations claims a strong presence in the domestic market, particularly in the automotive segment.


Going nanoscale
Tevo Creations uses imported chemicals from Europe containing nano-particles to produce customised nano-coating for different industries.
But what is the significance of having the nano-element in their products?
“The nano-coating provides protection for buildings and automobiles against scratches, corrosion, ultra violet rays, and acid rains,” Ng explains.
“This is because nano-scale particles and structures possess enhanced strength, flexibility, heat transmission, electrical conductivity, sensitivity, selectivity and reactivity as well as heat and electrical insulation.
“To give you a sense of the matter, one nanometre is a billionth of a metre and is approximately the width of a human hair sliced 100,000 times,” Ng adds.
The company started off producing nano-coating for automobiles and have formulated over 22 products for this segment, to-date.
Subsequently, it expanded its offerings into the buildings and consumer categories.

 
Tried and tested: An employee performs tests on its products to ensure they meet standards.


“The nano-coating we formulated for the construction industry prevents water leakage, and has self-cleaning, anti-stain and disinfectant qualities.
“For the consumer segment, Tevo Creations has developed nano-coating for furniture, leather, fabrics, electronic appliances, and spectacles,” he says.
But it wasn’t easy formulating these products. Ng says the company faced a lot of challenges in the initial years.
“We lacked the experience to use the imported chemicals to formulate effective nano-coating that could be commercialised.
“We only managed to surmount the problem three years later after we had assembled a team of experienced chemists,” he says.
With its product line-up in place, the company grew rapidly in the local market.
According to Ng, Tevo Creations has a strong presence in the domestic market, although the company exports 80% of its nano-coating products.
“In the country, we have successfully penetrated the automotive market, even tint shops use our nano-coating.
“In the local construction industry, we supply to heritage preservation and new commercial building projects. The nano-coating prevents surface appearance degradation, mould and fungus growth, and pollution,” he says.
The company has achieved more than 50% growth annually over the past two years. And with nano-technology expected to gather interest, Tevo Creations is optimistic that its topline will receive a boost.
“We achieved a seven-digit figure revenue in 2016. In three years, we want to hit a eight-digit figure turnover,” Ng says.
According to a Market Insights Report, the global nano-coating market size will increase to US$12bil by 2025 from US$4.83bil in 2018, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9%.
However, Ng cautions that there are also many companies in Malaysia that are marketing fake nano-coating products.
“Currently, there is no proper enforcement to keep these fake products out of the market.
“But the recent set-up of NanoVerify Sdn Bhd (NVSB) is a step in the right direction to certify the genuine suppliers of nano-coating products,” he says.
NVSB has rolled out a voluntary nanotechnology certification programme to get suppliers to have their products and processes with claims of nano-elements in the range of one to 100 nanometre verified.
The programme is jointly created with Sirim Qas International and is administered under the advisory of Standards Malaysia in 2015.

 
Bigger capacity: The company recently upgraded its facility to accommodate larger quantities.


Banking on construction
Tevo Creations’ diversification into the buildings segment has borne fruit for the company. The segment contributes about a quarter of its sales.
And with rapid development taking place in the South-East Asia region, the company’s aim to spread its wings further could be well rewarded in the future.
Research reports note the strong potential in the region.
According to a Grand View Research report, titled South East Asia Construction Coatings Market 2018-2025, Asia Pacific is likely to observe an increase in its construction expenditure over the forecast period due to quick urbanisation coupled with an increase in population.
“Overall, Asia Pacific capital project and infrastructure market are likely to register 7% to 8% growth a year over the next decade, approaching US$5.3 trillion by 2025 and representing nearly 60% of the world’s total market,” the report says.
Ng says that infrastructure restructuring plans adopted by countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam are expected to drive demand in the construction industry, and subsequently, demand for coating products.

This certainly sits well with Tevo Creations.
“The growing construction industry in South-East Asian economies is likely to drive market demand over the forecast period.
“The Philippines is predicted to display the fastest growing rate, in terms of revenue,” Ng adds.
The report further highlights that infrastructure spending in that country is anticipated to reach US$27bil by 2025, growing at 10% per annum in the next decade.
“In addition, at least 25,000 residential condominiums are likely to be built in Manila’s main business districts in the next few years. At least 37 projects in total are currently active, which are expected to boost the construction sector,” Ng says.
Meanwhile, in Indonesia, overall infrastructure spending is anticipated to grow to around US$165bil by 2025.
“These factors are expected to drive building sector in Indonesia over the forecast period, which, in turn, is anticipated to propel the product demand in the future. Indonesia is the fastest growing market in the region,” Ng says.

The report also expects infrastructure investments in Malaysia to grow 9% per annum.
“The government has been working to meet the country’s housing shortage, which is likely to have a positive impact on the construction coatings industry over the forecast period,” Ng offers.
Tevo Creations currently exports 80% of its products to South-East Asia, the UAE, Russia, Poland and the US.
Last year, it produced 50,000 tonnes of nano-coating – sufficient to cover 2.56 million sq ft of building surface – which generated 25% of the company’s revenue.
It also produced more than 2,500 litres of automotive silica coating for the automotive industry, which can be used for surface protection of approximately 100,000 vehicles. This contributed to the remaining 75% of the company’s revenue.
The company recently upgraded its production facility in Penang, which Ng says, will enable it to manufacture 2,000 litres of nano-coating for buildings and 200 litres of automotive nano-coating per day.
According to Ng, the company is now looking for an angel investor to help jump start its production of chemicals with nano-particles.
“We will need about RM20mil to start such a facility here.
“If we are successful, our operation cost will be reduced significantly,” he adds.
Tevo Creations also plans to automate its production process to ensure that the nano-coating produced is compliant with international standards.
Ng is confident that its products will continue to give the company a competitive edge. He says Tevo Creations has developed a super hydrophobic invisible coating that could repel water and dirt completely.
“This new coating is suitable for use in household, commercial, and industrial properties. If there is no water, or dirt, on the building surfaces, you will save substantially on cleaning and maintenance expenditure,” he says.
“What also sets us apart from other players is our swift response to clients’ requests to provide them with the necessary technical assistance regardless of their location,” he adds.
Ng says that infrastructure restructuring plans adopted by countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam are expected to drive demand in the construction industry, and subsequently, demand for coating products.

Last Saturday, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Dexma Express Sdn Bhd, the official general sales agent of Garuda Indonesia’s subsidiary Citilink, for potential investment in the upcoming Citilink Malaysia operation.
SMTrack is proposing to acquire a 60% stake in the operation for RM3.5mil.
Dexma would change its name to Citilink Aviation Malaysia Sdn Bhd and obtain air operator certificate and other licences or permits required, a representative from SMTrack, Jay Hoo Ying Wah, told reporters after the signing ceremony.
The share sales agreement, meanwhile, is expected to be concluded within three months from the date of the MoU signing.
Citilink Aviation was expected to start operation in the second quarter of 2019, providing low-cost flights especially to customers flying within the Asean region, Hoo said.
“Our first route will be from Kuala Lumpur to Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Outside the Asean countries, we will soon target China,” he said.
Meanwhile, Dexma director Alvin Heng Jee Zhi, said passengers flying with the airline would enjoy free 10kg baggage allowance and meals.
“We are not only competing in providing affordable flight tickets but also better service. We are going to be a new player in Malaysia but we are experienced in the Indonesian market,” he said.
Jakarta-based Citilink was established in 2001 as a low-cost brand of Garuda Indonesia, set up to operate shuttle services between Indonesian cities.
But since July 30, 2012, it has officially operated as a separate subsidiary of the Indonesian national carrier.
Citilink’s fleet size currently stands at just over 50 aircraft.
SMTrack, listed on Bursa Malaysia’s ACE Market, provides online track and trace solutions and platforms using RFID. Its tagging solutions ensure traceability in the logistics and supply chain as well as food processing, among others.
The group narrowed its net loss to RM3.87mil on revenue of RM1.51mil for the financial year ended July 31, 2018, compared with a loss of RM7.38mil in the preceding year.
At last Friday’s close, shares of SMTrack rose half a sen to 11.5 sen. — Bernama"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/net-foreign-selling-continues-for-third-consecutive-week/,Net foreign selling continues for third consecutive week,Markets,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia continued to experience net foreign selling for the third consecutive week as investors shifted their asset allocation into safe havens such as bonds and money market. 
This was due to the bearish scenario in the global market which has a far more significant impact than internal factors. 
Bank Islam Malaysia chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said in fact, net selling during the first four days of this week (April 8-April11) amounted to RM162.8mil, a decline from RM291.9mil in the same period last week. 
“Retail investors are the main buyers in Bursa Malaysia at RM110.1mil during April 8-April11, a rebound from RM11.3mil worth of sales from April 1-April 4.
“The local institutions’ participation in the local stocks stood at RM52.8mil between April 8 and April 11 compared with RM303.2mil between April 1 and April 4,” he told Bernama.
He said outflows may feature in the near term but the main trigger would be external developments such as the terrible outcome of Brexit, the dovish stance among the major central bankers, as well as the recent downward revision in global growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“Naturally, during such period, investors would be very defensive, leading to higher demand for safe haven securities such as fixed income instrument,” he said.
Meanwhile, Phillip Capital Management senior vice president (investment) Datuk Dr Nazri Khan Adam Khan said the drop in the net selling value on a week-to-week basis was underpinned by local factors including better commodity prices, ringgit stabilisation and the expectation of better gross domestic product for the second quarter of this year.
He told Bernama that on a year-to-date basis, foreign funds had sold RM1.8 billion net of local equities.
“Looking at the effect on Bursa Malaysia which will likely to see a technical rebound next week, it is expected that there will be a net foreign funds buying of five per cent, driven by rising commodity prices as well as the unchanged interest rate,” he said.
As for the ringgit movement for the week under review (April 8-11), the disappointing Industrial Production Index data for February 2019, which grew only 1.7 per cent year-on-year, coupled with the downward revision of the global growth forecast by IMF, had dragged the ringgit to hit a 10-week low of 4.1120 against the US dollar.
However, a financial analyst who requested anonymity said the news on the resumption of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) announced by the Prime Minister’s Office would provide impetus to the ringgit. — Bernama"

The company had earlier planned to spin off its gaming machine leasing unit in Hong Kong.
“We need to wait for a conducive environment to implement our initial public offering plans in Hong Kong,” group managing director Datuk Chuah Kim Seah told StarBiz.
Chuah, in October last year, was reported to have said that the company is exploring a possible spinoff of its technical support and management (TSM) division. 
The company’s machine leasing business is housed under this division. 
But despite the fund-raising setback, the company has allocated US$20mil (RM82mil) to secure new machines for its concession programme this year. In 2018, the budget was US$25mil.
This year, RGB is targeting to install an additional 1,770 gaming machines across Asia, of which 1,300 units are earmarked for the Philippines market.
“In the Philippines, some 600 gaming machines have already been installed in the casino according to the terms and conditions of the contract,” Chuah said.
The remaining units will be installed by end-July.
“These 1,300 machines would generate a yield of at least US$50mil for the group over the next five years,” Chuah said. 
The group’s business in the Philippines contributes over 60% of its annual revenue.
In Cambodia, RGB will install another 280 machines this year. This will give a return of at least US$10mil over the next five years.   
“About 200 machines are for an expansion project. The remaining 80 machines will be used in a new casino,” Chuah said.
In Timor Leste, RGB is targeting to install 100 new machines that are projected to generate an income of US$1mil a year for the next five years.
The group is also expanding its business in Vietnam. 
“In Hanoi, we have just been awarded a management contract for five years starting May 2019 to provide management of an existing club with 130 machines that would generate a profit of US$1.5mil a year for the next five years,” Chuah said.
RGB posted a net profit of RM35.17mil in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 on a revenue of RM379mil.
The other key part of the group’s business is the sales, services and marketing (SSM) division.
Chuah said the group expects to sell 1,600 new slot machines this year. “The new machines are for the markets in the Asean region,” he said.
Meanwhile, the group is also looking at opportunities to enter the Myanmar market.  News reports have suggested that Myanmar is set to approve in May a bill that would allow for the setting up of foreign-only casinos in the country.
“We are studying the market now, as we have already received enquiries from potential casino operators in Myanmar,” Chuah said.
On the Latin and South American market, RGB is fine-tuning its gaming machines to comply with the requirements of the casinos.
“Our Latin and South American partners are helping us to penetrate into the markets in Panama and Mexico.
“It is a huge market, as there are now about 60,000 gaming machines in operation in the region,” he said."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/inside-softbanks-push-to-rule-the-road/,Inside SoftBank’s push to rule the road,Investment,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"SAN FRANCISCO: SoftBank Group Corp leader Masayoshi Son has much bigger ambitions for transportation than simply seeing his investment in Uber Technologies Inc turn into more than US$13bil when the company goes public next month.
The Japanese entrepreneur is placing a US$60bil bet in more than 40 companies in a bid to steer the US$3 trillion global automotive industry now dominated by vehicles people own and drive to a spectrum of transportation services available at the touch of a smartphone app. Those services range from ride hailing and car sharing to delivery robots and self-driving vehicles.
The extent of those investments, based on a Reuters analysis of publicly available data and interviews with a dozen sources familiar with SoftBank’s investment strategy, has not previously been reported. They show how Son has emerged as one of the power players trying to influence how people and goods move about the world in the coming decades.
Key partners in Son’s quest are Uber, the US ride services leader, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp.
Uber’s planned initial public stock offering in May is expected to value the company at US$90bil to US$100bil, representing a potential windfall to SoftBank, which put US$8bil into Uber for a 15% stake in January 2018. The rising value of that investment will further supercharge Son’s growing clout in the sector, and eventually provide him with additional capital to invest in mobility.
Closer to home, Toyota approached Son more than a year ago about a partnership, and SoftBank in February 2018 signed a memorandum of understanding with the automaker to consider how they might jointly develop mobility services, according to sources familiar with the document. The agreement was followed by the launch of a joint venture dubbed Monet Technologies, designed to set up automated mobility services.
SoftBank and Toyota are also in talks to co-lead a US$1bil investment in Uber’s self-driving unit, Reuters reported in March. While the deal is close to being finalised, discussions remain ongoing around issues such as how much of the unit SoftBank would control, sources told Reuters.
In an interview with Reuters, SoftBank Group chief operating officer Marcelo Claure said that the two Japanese companies “have a lot sessions in which we think and we try to redefine the future of mobility.”
Central to those sessions are discussions about how Toyota and SoftBank can collaborate to bring autonomous vehicles to Japan, he said.
Son has been working since 2014 to weave together a tapestry of diverse transportation bets. His deep portfolio of investments range literally from A to Z: From Arm, a British semiconductor maker that Son acquired in 2016 for US$32bil, to Zume Pizza, a Silicon Valley startup that aims to automate pizza delivery and raised US$375mil last year from SoftBank. SoftBank has used at least five investment vehicles, including the US$100bil Vision Fund, from which to make its mobility investments, public records show. Its deep pockets, aggressive investing tactics and sweeping vision of the future of transportation give SoftBank and its leader Son an outsized influence in shaping the entire industry.
The Vision Fund has more than 30 investment professionals who work to promote cooperation and integration among the portfolio companies, which they refer to as a “family.”
“We can create this web where companies talk to each other and they help each other because they are part of the same family and they do joint ventures and they do joint investments,” Claure said.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/billionaire-lashes-out-as-us-fund-invade-uk-retail-crisis/,Billionaire lashes out as US fund invade UK retail crisis,Retail,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"LOndon: UK retail billionaire Mike Ashley is lashing out after losing a fight with US hedge funds over department store chain Debenhams Plc.
The retail magnate, who made British headlines for power drinking and substandard working conditions at his sporting goods chain, has been blasting Debenhams management and making legal threats since lenders took control on April 9, wiping out his roughly 30% stake.
The loss by Debenhams’ largest shareholder and king of UK retail, who has led a crusade to protect Britain’s forlorn shopping districts from online competition, signals the extent of the sector’s debt crisis and the businessman’s bluster. Ashley was outmaneuvered by lenders as he fought the company at every turn.
“Ashley played this badly wrong,” said Stephen Lienert, a credit analyst at Jefferies in London. 
“He could have bought Debenhams’ debt or sided with the lenders. He could have played it several other ways. Instead he went his own route and that was a massive mistake.”
Officials at Debenhams and Ashley’s Sports Direct International Plc declined to comment.
The problems at Debenhams, once one of Britain’s most-loved department stores, go back to a 2003 leveraged buyout led by private-equity firms CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Texas Pacific Group. The buyers saddled Debenhams with debt and sold stores to pay themselves dividends.
The company has struggled to develop its online business as consumers shift purchases to Amazon.com Inc. and other e-commerce providers. That’s claimed household names from department-store owner BHS to the British arm of Toys “R” Us Inc.
Debenhams’s lenders Alcentra, GoldenTree Asset Management and Silver Point Capital will now seek to cut rents, close stores and convert some debt to equity to prevent the 241-year-old company from going under. The private owners aren’t expecting to report first-half earnings next week as previously planned.
The lenders are likely to seek a type of restructuring known as a company voluntary arrangement in coming weeks to loosen expensive leases and are poised to appoint a turnaround specialist as chief restructuring officer.
Administrators have put Debenhams up for sale in the hope that a buyer will fully repay its £720mil (US$944mil) of debt. That means Ashley could get back in, but he hasn’t made any public statements suggesting plans, and it would cost more than three times his highest previous offer.
“Ashley could walk away entirely and forget it, or buy it down the road if he believes the business will struggle, or write a big check today for it,” said Lienert at Jefferies. “But paying up has never been his style.”
The 54 year-old retail heavyweight has an empire that encompasses Debenhams’s rival department store chain House of Fraser, along with Sports Direct, Evans Cycles, underwear brand Agent Provocateur and Newcastle United soccer club.
He spent about £150mil acquiring his stake in Debenhams, but was on the back foot with lenders since the funds and European banks extended a £40mil lifeline in February. That secured funding gave them priority in debt talks ahead of unsecured lenders and shareholders.
The company rejected Ashley’s own 40 million-pound loan offer late last year because it came with strings attached.
Instead of buying Debenhams’ existing debt and playing hedge funds at their own game, Ashley followed a contradictory strategy of making offers to control the company while sparring with the board.
He made at least six approaches to Debenhams, culminating in an offer to underwrite a £200mil rights issue. Each was rebuffed -- mostly because they fell short of lenders’ requirements and demanded Ashley be installed as chief executive officer.
He sought to remove most of the directors after leading an ouster of Debenhams’s chairman and CEO from the board in January, then vowed to expose an insider plot to steer the company into the hands of hedge funds, which he dubbed Project Serpico after a 1970s movie about a corruption-fighting cop.
In the days approaching the prepack administration, the acerbic tycoon called for the board to take lie-detector tests and for advisers to be put in prison. 
On the day he lost control, Ashley accused politicians and regulators of being “as effective as a chocolate teapot,” dubbed the administration a “national scandal” and called on authorities to reverse it.
He used an April 11 stock buyback at Sports Direct as another opportunity to twist the knife, telling shareholders that his actions contrast with those of Debenhams’ board.
“Mike Ashley has made so many mistakes in his doomed pursuit of the embattled Debenhams that his credibility as a businessman and a gambler has been seriously damaged,” independent retail analyst Nick Bubb wrote in a note to clients. — Bloomberg"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/exporters-told-to-learn-regulations-in-their-exporting-countries/,Exporters told to learn regulations in their exporting countries,Economy,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: Exporters need to know the importing countries’ regulations when exporting their products to ensure smoother transactions.
“For example, the labelling of products will depend on the (importing) country,” said Linaco Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd managing director Joe Ling.
“Also, exporting companies may need to modify their products to meet the foreign country’s safety and security codes and other import restrictions.
“Modifications are often necessary to satisfy the importing country’s labelling or packaging requirements,” said Ling, who was a panellist at a forum on Critical Aspects for Exporters during the Export Excellence Awards 2019 roadshow in Penang.
 
 
 
He told the 100 attendees that knowing the importing countries’ requirements, market demands and maintaining the quality of products would contribute to success in export.
Branding is also crucial and Ling urged exporters to utilise national trade promotion agency Malaysia External Trade Development Corp’s (Matrade) services.
“By leveraging on Matrade and their wide network, we would automatically gain some instant branding. Participation in international trade exhibitions is considered branding but it has to be consistent on a yearly basis.
“Some trade visitors might not talk to you during the first time but they will eventually engage you because of your consistent participation,” he said, adding that booth size at trade expos made a difference too.
Ling said businesses venturing into export markets should network with the export fraternity, join associations, seek advice from experienced exporters and even visit the importers.
He revealed that one of the toughest lessons he has learnt over the years was bad debts as a result of not getting enough information on the customer’s background.
He shared that challenges in the export business included the export and import process, payment, language barrier, finding the right importer, different time zone and costs.
On the export and import process, he said exporters have to arrange for shipment from port to port, container loading, accurate shipping documents, cargo arrival, import clearance, Customs inspection and delivery to the customer.
Any mishandling of cargo, or error in procedure and documents would delay the entire process and cause the exporter to incur penalty charges, he said.
As for payment, he said there have been cases of customers refusing to remit under bank-issued letters of credit due to their lack of knowledge in preparing the required shipping documents. 
Also, delays in telegraphic transfer payment by the customer could affect bank charges due to fluctuating currency rates, he said.
On challenges in food and beverage exports, Ling listed geography and transit time, shelf life, import duties and tax, cargo handling, weather as well as peak and non-peak seasons.

Shan Ying International Holdings Co Ltd and SEDC will collaborate on the project under a memorandum of understanding the two parties inked in Anhui Province, China, last week.
The MoU signatories were Shan Ying chairman Wu Mingwu and SEDC chairman Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Husain. Sarawak Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg witnessed the event.
Shan Ying, which is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is principally engaged in the manufacture and distribution of paper products. The company is one of the large industrial paper-making enterprises and extra-large packaging board manufacturers in China.
The company, according to a SEDC statement, has built a domestic and foreign regenerated fibre recycling network, water transport terminals, a private power station, industrial wastewater treatment facilities and other supporting systems.
Shan Ying boasts an annual yield of 3.05 million tonnes of paper and one billion tonnes of cardboard and paper carton, ranking top in the industry in terms of production scale.
“In Sarawak, Shan Ying intends to establish a fully integrated pulp and paper manufacturing plant with a production capacity of two million tonnes per annum and manned by 2,500 personnel.
“The US$1.8bil project will be implemented in two phases. Construction of phase 1 of the plant will commence in 2020 and is targeted to be completed and operational by 2023.
“Phase 2 will commence immediately after completion of Phase 1,” according to SEDC.
Johari, in welcoming the Chinese investment in the mega project, said it would be a value-added industry as the plant would use imported recycled paper for its production without having to exploit Sarawak’s natural resources.
The Chief Minister was reportedly impressed with Shan Ying’s eco-friendly technology for paper production, which include extensive waste-water treatment facilities.
“The clean, safe and environment friendly technology (will) use our renewable energy from hydroelectic (dam) infrastructure,” said Johari.
He said the plant would generate spin-off economic activities and benefit Sarawakians, as there would be an expected demand for skilled manpower that requires sharing of technical expertise that would lead to development of technical colleges and training centres."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/kajangputrajaya-rail-link-may-be-revived/,Kajang-Putrajaya rail link may be revived,Corporate News,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Plans are afoot to revive the abandoned RM400mil Putrajaya rail link with an additional extension up to the Kajang mass rapid transit (MRT) station.
It is believed that Putrajaya Holdings Sdn Bhd, which is the master developer of Putrajaya administrative capital, is looking into the rail project which has been abandoned since 2004 because of the heavy traffic to the area now.
“It started as a monorail project within Putrajaya. Now apart from monorail, the option is to make it a light rail transit (LRT) project with connectivity up to the MRT station in Kajang,” said a source.
The rail link, which may potentially be Malaysia’s fourth light rail transit (LRT) line, could likely be developed at a cost of about RM2bil which includes systems work, sources said.
The lower cost is mainly because the necessary civil infrastructure works have been completed under the previous Putrajaya monorail project, before it was abruptly shelved in 2004 due to budget constraint.
“While it may take about six months to a year before the project development begins, I can confirm that the government wants to proceed with the project,” said the source.  
He said the development of the new rail link would be handled by Putrajaya Corp and the Federal Territories Ministry.
If the rail link is revived, the source said it would complete “a circle connecting Sungai Buloh, Kajang and Putrajaya”.
He was referring to the MRT 1 line between Sungai Buloh and Kajang and the MRT 2 line between Sungai Buloh and Putrajaya.
With the new rail link, commuters especially civil servants working in Putrajaya would be able to travel between Kajang and the administrative city hassle-free.
“It makes sense to develop the rail link, considering that the civil works and tunneling have been done but are left unused until now,” said the source.
He added that the possible revival of the rail link was timely to improve connectivity to locations within Putrajaya and out of the administrative capital.
In October last year, Putrajaya Corp president Datuk Dr Aminuddin Hassim said the stalled Putrajaya monorail project may be revived soon. “We are looking at the cost factor and whether it is reasonable to do it, taking into consideration the anticipated ridership,” he said.
Aminuddin also hinted that the rail line might be extended to Bangi, Kajang and even Kuala Lumpur.
Critics have long labelled the Putrajaya monorail as a “white elephant”, as the structures such as unfinished tunnels and an unconnected bridge have been abandoned for years.
The Putrajaya monorail idea was mooted during Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s first stint as Prime Minister.
Initially, the rail link started off as an LRT system before being converted into a two-line monorail, considering Putrajaya’s population density back then.
After Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi took over the premiership in 2004 following Dr Mahathir’s resignation, he shelved the Putrajaya monorail project, citing a lack of funds.
However, various quarters have since urged the government to re-consider the decision and revive the project.
These include former Putrajaya Corp president Tan Sri Samsudin Osman, who has repeatedly urged the government to restart the project due to mounting parking-related complaints.
The Star had also reported several years ago that Dr Mahathir was disappointed by the indefinite postponement of the Putrajaya monorail project.
In 2016, it was reported that MMC Corp Bhd  had proposed to the Economic Council to revive the Putrajaya monorail project, following the government’s investment in the Klang Valley MRT project.
The news report also said that MMC Corp expected the project to be completed by 2021, in time to complement the completion of the MRT 2. However, no further development has been reported on the matter ever since."

The merger, the sixth largest energy acquisition by value, propels Chevron two spots to the second-largest major by oil output, behind Exxon Mobil Corp, according to research firms Drillinginfo and Wood Mackenzie.
The deal announced last Friday comes less than three months after Wirth bought Pasadena Refining System Inc, the (PRSI) operator of a Texas oil refinery.
“My aspirations are for the company to be a strong performer,” Wirth said in an interview last Friday. 
“We have always said and will still say that anything we do would have to make us even stronger.”
Wirth, 58, took over as chief executive 14 months ago, with a reputation for keen attention to costs earned from running Chevron’s pipeline and trading units, and nearly a decade in charge of its refining business.
The Anadarko deal was negotiated over the last few weeks, though Chevron has been thinking about the deal for some time, Wirth, a chemical engineer by training, said.
Chevron regularly evaluates potential deals and has a number of companies “that we’re watching,” said Wirth. 
But completing the latest purchase is now his priority. “Executing it well is important, so that will be our focus,” said Wirth.
The Chevron executive is detailed-oriented and a relentless worker, said Mike Sommers, president of industry group American Petroleum Institute, where Wirth is a member of the executive committee. 
After a recent dinner concluded at 10pm, Wirth headed off to make calls to staff overseas, Sommers said.
“He is not someone who enters into every conversation but when he engages on an issue, he has a way of bringing the room together,” said Sommers.
His agreement with Anadarko marks the company’s biggest expansion since its acquisition of Texaco in 2000. 
The purchase makes Chevron the top producer in the Permian Basin, the largest US shale field. It also expands its oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico and in liquefied natural gas.
“It wasn’t that long ago you wouldn’t have heard the word ‘Permian’ in anything from Chevron,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise Capital.
Chevron’s $350mil deal for PRSI, a Gulf Coast refinery business owned by Brazil’s Petrobras, fits its Permian expansion.

The RM250mil is paid irrespective of prevailing crude palm oil (CPO) prices. In 2012 when the LLA was negotiated, the average CPO price was RM2,843 per tonne. This compares with the current CPO price which is trading below RM2,100 per tonne.Additionally, FGV has committed to pay Felda a 15% share of estate operating profits. FGV also maintains that it has met all its obligations under the LLA.However, the planter will be required to seek the approval of its shareholders for any proposed amendments to the LLA.Meanwhile, FGV welcomes the government’s plans to revive Felda and its new commitment to alleviate the financial woes of Felda settlers.It notes that the plan to diversify the income streams of settlers is a positive move and “FGV would be happy to participate in strategic discussions to seek viable solutions and explore potential synergies that will benefit all stakeholders”.FGV, under its new management, is focused on its group-wide transformation plan which has started to show results.

There has been a convergence of key simple moving averages (SMA) in the 49 sen and 52 sen range, which indicates that the stock has been undergoing a consolidation phase.

However, Friday’s strong 5.5 sen or 10.5% advance to an intra-day high of 58 sen suggested that the counter may be angling for a break out of the sideways channel.
The outlook on the daily price chart has improved over the last month as the share price is now trading above the key SMAs.
The stock is only at the budding stages of an uptrend, and needs a stronger push through at least the first overhead resistance to confirm strong positive momentum.
The 61 sen-63.5 sen range serves as a hurdle to the share price rally, being the high last achieved at end-September 2018.
The technical indicators also reflect that positive momentum remains weak at present.
The slow-stochastic momentum index shows the percent k oscillator crossing the percent D oscillator, triggering a “buy” signal at 44 points.
The daily moving average convergence/divergence line is also only just committing to a positive trend, having crossed the signal line in Friday’s advance. 
A strong lift off the signal line over the course of the coming sessions would indicate that the bullish trend is picking up steam.
The 14-day relative strength index is looking strong at 77 points. Although crossing into overbought conditions, there is no indication that the index is losing steam, and hence suggests strong momentum.
The short-term 14- and 21-day SMAs are also on a positive angle, which indicates rising support over the near-term. At present, they offer immediate support at 52 sen.
The lowermost 50-day SMA line at 49 sen has showed to be a reliable support level for the share price in recent weeks, and is expected to hold intact short of any negative catalyst coming into play.

The government announced the continuation of the East Coast Rail Link on Friday at a lower cost of RM44bil. Construction plays tied to the project put on guarded gains although AmInvestment research was quick to point out that the project was not a game-changer for the sector as a whole.
Among the 30 KLCI-linked counters, MAHB was a notable laggard during the week as it slipped 7% over four consecutive sessions to Thursday, where it closed at a week’s low of RM6.61. The counter partially rebounded to RM6.82 on Friday following news its operating agreement to manage Malaysia’s airports had been extended by 35 years.Tenaga Nasional’s 4% slump on Thursday also dragged on the back of Khazanah Nasional’s RM1.05bil share placement pricing at the lower end of the indicative range at RM12.33 a piece. This led to a rout on the overall index, which tumbled 15.1 points on Thursday to a week’s low of  1,624.23.
Things have been looking dour for the FBM KLCI as a whole. A slight two-point gain on Monday was quickly erased by three successive days of decline, leaving the market firmly below a short-term descending trendline.On Friday, the index recovered 5.94 points to end the week at 1,630.17.
In other parts of Asia, news of Beijing cutting back on banks’ reserve ratio requirements enthused investors as the latest in a series of stimulus measures to prop up the country’s economy.
The US-China trade war  is ambling along with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announcing on Thursday that the two nations had come to an agreement on enforcement mechanisms. While hurdles remain, observers are optimistic over the prospects of a resolution, as opposed to an indefinite impasse. However, US president Donald Trump appears to be starting a fight on yet another front, putting already jittery markets on edge.
Trump said he was looking to enforce tariffs on US$11bil of European Union (EU) goods following the World Trade Organisation’s finding that European subsidies to Airbus had a negative impact on the United States.
This conflict will be significantly smaller than the US-China trade disagreement, but the rising protectionism only reinforces the negative outlook on the global economy.
Central banks are looking more dovish of late, suggesting there are growing concerns over the  global economy. The European Central Bank kept an accommodative stance on interest rates, which keeps in step with the International Monetary Fund’s recent forecast for 3.3% global growth in 2019, down from 3.5%.
Moving forward, the United States will enter another corporate earnings season, putting investors on tenterhooks as companies are expected to post declining profits.
While funds flowed back into equities following the US Federal Reserve’s indication that it would not raise policy rates this year, the black-and-white of profit numbers will determine the direction of trading over the immediate term.
Over in Europe, US Prime Minister Theresa May has managed to secure a delay in the Brexit deadline to Oct 31, leaving more time for lawmakers to pass an exit proposal.
However, May had staked her premiership on securing Britain’s departure from the EU by June 30, increasing the likelihood of her resignation  from the top post before the completion of a Brexit deal.
Statistics: The major index ended the week 11.64 points or 0.7% lower over the previous week, at 1,630.17. Total turnover for the trading week stood at 17.52 billion shares amounting to RM11.47bil compared with 13.89 billion shares worth RM9.58bil over the previous week.
Outlook: The short-term descending trendline that started on Feb 22 was extended this week with the FBM KLCI briefly passing below the support level of 1,626 on Thursday.
Indeed, the rebound on the market seen in the week prior failed to hold fast. The index could not break above the lower-most 14-day simple moving average (SMA) at the start of the week, triggering a retreat.
The short-term SMA lines continue to press lower, keeping the selling pressure on the index even as the 50-day SMA descended below the 100-day SMA in a bearish crossing.
By Friday, The FBM KLCI managed to clamber above the support although the key momentum indicators suggest that there will be continued downwards pressure on the index. The slow-stochastic is nearing the oversold line at 25 points, and looks likely to continue falling on strong negative momentum. The daily moving  average convergence/divergence line has also slipped below the signal line to suggest a “sell” signal and confirm a downtrend. Based on the current negative technical outlook, there is a strong possibility that the index will test the 1,609 support level over the near-term. 
The first indication of a positive recovery would be the crossing of the 14-day SMA, presently near 1,640, which at this point looks to be dictating the downwards slope on the daily price chart."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/are-we-paying-our-workers-enough/,Are we paying our workers enough?,Economy,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"HOW much should our workers be paid? This issue has long been debated by our lawmakers as well as our institutions, which include Bank Negara in its latest 2018 annual report and the highly respected Khazanah Research Institute (KRI).
According to Bank Negara, the labour share of income, despite having risen from 31.7% in 2010 to 35.2% of GDP in 2017, still lags behind most advanced economies, which implies that a larger fraction of national income in Malaysia goes to capital owners rather than workers.
KRI, on the other hand, says Malaysia’s low-wage environment has forced young job-seekers to be willing to work for as low as RM1,715 on average, or about 40% lower than 2017’s national mean monthly wage, and has called upon the government to urgently review wage levels, especially among young graduates as well as low-skilled workers. 
With the argument put forward by our institutions, an analysis among our listed companies tells us a mixed picture. The following analysis is made within the core sectors of Bursa Malaysia Main Market-listed companies, taking into consideration the fact that most of them have just released their 2018 annual reports. The top market-capitalised company in each sector is chosen to represent the industry, while the measurement of payment to their respective workers is solely based on salaries, wages and bonuses paid, and excludes contributions to provident funds, benefits made or provided for, as well as costs associated with share-based schemes, if any.

The key column in Table 1 (left) is the staff share of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), which demonstrates how much of the Ebitda earned by a company, before taking into consideration staff salaries, is actually paid to the employees in percentage terms. The figure on the number of staff is taken as per the annual reports, with the exception of Maxis Bhd .
The  second important column in Table 1 is the staff cost as a percentage of revenue, as well as the second-last column, which explains what percentage of revenue earned goes towards paying salaries and wages. The last column is a column for readers to appreciate - which companies pay their workers the best or worst monthly salaries on average, which is also an indication for potential employees to target which sector to concentrate on for their future employment. 
Although just 13 companies are captured in this analysis, they represent 28% of the total market capitalisation of Bursa Malaysia, and out of the 13, eight are FBM KLCI-linked stocks. The other obvious observation from Table 1 is that the profitability level among different industries varies greatly from as high as almost a 75% Ebitda margin in the REITs sector to just 14% in the transportation and logistics segment. 
For these 13 companies, for every RM1.00 earned, 27 sen goes to the salaries and wages of workers, which is even below the labour share of income envisaged by Bank Negara in its 2018 annual report, ie, assuming this is a comparable measurement. 
Among the sectors, REITs has a very low share of salaries over the Ebitda earned, as the sector typically employs fewer people due to the nature of the industry, as most REITs actually provide management services for their assets. Staff cost as a percentage of Ebitda is high in sectors which are dependent on mass labour to generate revenue such as healthcare services, especially those related to the operations of hospitals like IHH Healthcare Bhd . MISC Bhd  too has a relatively high percentage of staff cost, while those in the range of between 30%-40% are rather common, led by MyEG Services Bhd at 38.8%; Sime Darby Plantation Bhd (38.6%); Nestle (M) Bhd  (37.4%); Dialog Group Bhd   (34.2%) and Malayan Banking Bhd  (31.4%).
On average, our top listed companies within the key sectors only pay about 10 sen for every RM1 they earn as revenue to their staff as wages. Worse still, some pay even less than five sen for every RM1, while for IHH Healthcare, the figure is relatively high mainly due to perhaps higher wages for medical staff that are employed across its hospitals. 
Employees working for these top-13 companies typically earn, on average, a salary – together with bonuses paid – of about RM6,073 per person per month. However, the disparity between the sectors is rather high, with the highest being Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd  at more than RM16,000 per month, while in Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, it’s just above RM1,700 – almost a 10 times difference between the companies and between two very different industries. 
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, in his keynote address at Invest Malaysia last month, called upon Malaysian companies to pay higher wages to employees, as he believes that we should not have “a thoroughly unequal society where capital owners take too much a chunk of national income, leaving the workers or low-income households with scraps”.   The question is, what is a fair share of income for workers against what is earned by corporates? We can perhaps all agree (other than the employers that is) that 27 sen to the ringgit is not enough. Perhaps, a better reflection of income sharing is at least within the 35sen-40 sen range for every ringgit earned by our corporates at the Ebitda level.

 

Assuming our corporates pay about 35% of Ebitda before the staff cost earned, what is the cost to them? 
Effectively, an increase to 35%-40% of Ebitda being apportioned as staff cost will result in the current average salary per employed person per month to increase by 30% and 48% to RM7,889 and RM9,016, respectively. The impact to corporates on the Ebitda margin will not be significant in that the Ebitda margin will drop from 26.9% to 24% and 22.1%, respectively, while as a percentage of revenue, the companies’ staff cost will only increase by three percentage points to 12.9% if wages are 35% of Ebitda before staff cost and to 14.7% if the staff cost share of Ebitda is at 40%. Table 2 summarises the impact of a higher wage cost on companies’ Ebitda as well as a percentage of revenue. 
Given the above analysis, shouldn’t salaried persons be paid higher wages? I am sure anyone reading this who is an employee will agree with me. Higher wages would lead to higher disposable income, while at the same time generating a higher GDP growth as well as top-line growth for companies. Hence, paying our employees higher wages is not a zero sum game, and indeed, should be encouraged to keep up with the cost of living, as well as to ensure our workers have the resources to enjoy the basic rights of living, especially having a roof over their heads."

THE dollar’s strength sustained for the second consecutive week, up 0.13% to 97.2 over the week largely on the back of positive economic news which includes healthy labour market with non-farm payrolls adding 196,000 jobs in March after a 33,000 gain in the previous month with weekly jobless claims falling to the lowest in 50 years by 8,000 to 196,000 in the week ended April 6, and March’s faster-than-expected factory gate inflation up 2.2% y-o-y compared with 1.9% y-o-y in February (cons: 1.9%). 
However, the dollar’s gain for the week was capped following the downward revision on the US GDP in 2019 by the IMF to 2.3% from 2.5% previously, fuelling concerns on the strength of the US and global economy; weaker-than-expected core CPI, up 2.0% y-o-y in March from 2.1% y-o-y in February; as well as dovish FOMC minutes. 
The gloomy global outlook took a toll on oil prices as Brent closed lower by 0.38% to US$70.83/bbl for the week. Moreover, the US administration is expected to extend Iranian sanction waivers. This drove the oil prices further down along with the 7.03 million barrels increase in US inventories, according to the EIA’s weekly report. However, the supply disruption in Venezuela and continuous tightening from Opec kept the oil price floating above the US$70 mark.

Meanwhile, the euro weakened 0.09% to 1.125 following a dovish outlook painted by the ECB president and the risk that the region is facing suggests the need for more stimulus from the ECB to prevent the region from slipping into recession. Nonetheless, during the ECB’s monetary policy meeting, policymakers made no changes to its monetary policy as expected. It left the key interest rates steady and repeated that it planned to hold them at current levels at least through the end of the year. Moreover, the pair was partly weighed down after the US threatened to levy tariff on the US$11bil worth of export goods which offset the optimism from the closer EU-China ties.
The second extension for Brexit has lifted fears of a no-deal Brexit in the near term which boosted the pound to as high as 1.312. The six-month extension ends on Oct 31, the last day before the next EU commission takes over. Although the UK is allowed to leave the bloc earlier if a deal is agreed, it isn’t all good news to the parliament as it will require the UK to participate in the upcoming EU election. Moreover, the prospects of May’s replacement and a general election pressed the pound down by 0.02% to 1.306 by the end of the week. 
Demand for the yen rose early in the week after the IMF slashed its forecast for global economic growth this year, saying a slowdown could force world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures. The world economy will grow 3.3% this year, down from the 3.5% the IMF had forecast in January. However, the yen erased its weekly gains as it braced for a potential clash with the US over trade talks. Nonetheless, reports surfaced that the bilateral trade talks are expected to start next week. 
Asian ex-Japan currencies saw a mixed performance over the week against the dollar. The best performer of the week was the Indian rupee, up 1.1% to 68.9 driven by sustained foreign fund inflows into the equity market by US$565mil for the week as India goes to the polls. Meanwhile, the Singapore dollar weakened by 0.13% to 1.356 largely due to risk-off sentiment on global markets. 
The ringgit came in as the worst performer, losing 0.38% to 4.113 largely due to risk-off sentiment following woes on global growth. As a result, the KLCI shed 1.2% to 1,642 while foreigners continued to be net sellers, recording an outflow of RM163mil. At the same time, the marked deceleration in February’s industrial production, up 1.7% y-o-y from 3.2% y-o-y in January as well as slower retail sales which rose by 8.5% y-o-y compared with 10.6% y-o-y, contributed partly to the weaker ringgit.
US Treasuries (UST) Market 
The downward revision on the US GDP triggered strong buying across the curve. The buying was also supported by the weaker-than-expected core inflation print which read at 2.0% y-o-y in March from 2.1% y-o-y in February (cons: 2.1%) added with dovish FOMC minutes. However, the US Treasuries erased some of its gains by the end of the week, with a curve bear-flattening following March’s faster-than-expected factory gate inflation, up 2.2% y-o-y compared with 1.9% y-o-y in February (cons: 1.9%). Over the week, the overall benchmark yields closed 1-2bps lower. As at Friday, the 2-, 5-, and 10-year benchmark UST yields stood at 2.35%, 2.31%, and 2.50% respectively.
Malaysian Bond Market
The local bond market started off with some selling pressure as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund announced a divestment plan on its US$1 trillion holding of Emerging Market bonds from 10 countries which include over RM8bil worth of Malaysian government bonds. The MGS yield curve rose 1bps-3.5bps across the board. 
However, the selling pressure tapered following the release of dovish FOMC minutes. Nonetheless, the highlight for the week was the GII RM3.5bil 5-year new issuance auction which gathered a strong BTC of 2.313x with high/low/average of 3.669%/3.627%/3.655%. As at Friday morning, the 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year benchmark MGS yields settled at 3.39%, 3.56%, 3.66%, 3.77%, 4.07%, 4.29% and 4.58% respectively.
The Markit iBoxx ABF Malaysia Bond Index, an index comprising the MGS, GII and GG, returned 0.1% in the week from April 4 to April 11, 2019 as the index yield remained unchanged at 3.78%.  In the same period, the ABF Malaysia Bond Index Fund , an ETF which tracks the index, posted a return of 0.076% in the NAV as the fund yield inched up from 3.81% to 3.82%. Month to date, the fund returned 0.212% versus a 0.266% return posted by the index.
Flows to local govvies fell 37.6% to RM14.62bil from last week’s RM23.42bil. Activities across all segments dropped; MGS down 40% w-o-w to RM8.72bil from RM14.50bil while interest for GII declined 32.3% w-o-w to RM5.73bil from RM8.46bil in previous week. With no interest in the SPK, short-term bills (MTB/MITB) skidded 16% w/w to RM168mil this week. 
Likewise in the PDS market, flows slipped 11.3% w-o-w to RM3.42bil in this week from RM3.86bil. Some of 80.9% of the trade volume came from the GG/AAA segment while 16.2% were attributed to AA-rated papers and the remaining 2.9% from the A segment or lower.
In the GG/AAA segment, flows were dominated by Lembaga Pembiayaan Perumahan Sektor Awam (LPPSA) ‘2026-2036 papers, which closed with firmer yields between 3.910% and 4.345% on the back of RM665mil. 
Prasarana Sukuk Murabahah ‘24-47 tranches garnered RM465mil with yields settling at 3.839%–4.659%. Interest was also seen in Danainfra Nasional Bhd ‘24-49 issuances with RM460mil traded and yields closing at 3.780%–4.710%. 
On to the AA segment, Celcom Network ‘08/19 issuance saw yields trading 3.840%–3.944% with RM145mil changing hands. Edra Energy Sdn Bhd ‘23-38 IMTN saw yields closing firmer between 5.197% and 6.169% with RM131.5mil traded. Lastly, interest was seen in Southern Power Generation Sdn Bhd 2023-2032 tranches which saw yields closing mixed between 4.351% and 4.559% on a trade volume of RM55mil.
Ringgit Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Market 
The IRS curve was seen steepening from the belly to the longer end of the curve by 0.5–1.0bps. As at Friday’s noon pricing, the 3-month KLIBOR stood at 3.69%. Elsewhere, the 5-year CDS lower by 2.8% to 55.2.

Bezos routinely uses the letter to outline his long-term strategy, which made him the world’s wealthiest man and Amazon one of the most valuable companies.“Today I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our US$15 minimum wage,” Bezos said. “Do it! Better yet, go to US$16 and throw the gauntlet back at us. It’s a kind of competition that will benefit everyone.”The company in October pledged to pay all of its warehouse workers at least US$15 an hour, after presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren held out Amazon workers on food stamps as an example of the need for living wage protections.This was Bezos’s first shareholder letter since his personal affairs became tabloid fodder. The CEO in January announced his divorce from his wife of 25 years, Mackenzie Bezos, and the couple last week announced a settlement that leaves Bezos with 75% of their stock in the company. He remains Amazon’s biggest shareholder.Bezos made no direct mention of the divorce in his annual letter, maintaining distance between the company’s operations and his personal life.Bezos includes his 1997 shareholder letter to remind investors of his ability to capitalise on how the Internet would change the nature of shopping. His strategy and outlook have developed a cult-like following similar to that of Warren Buffett, whose annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway Inc investors are must-reads for those looking to understand the economy and Buffett’s investment strategy. - Bloomberg"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/fort-ltat-breached/,Fort LTAT breached,Investment,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"It has never been easy to decipher what goes on behind the workings of the Armed Forces Fund Board or better known as LTAT.
The returns, which comprise a cash portion and a special dividend in the form of units in a unit trust, have been consistently fair. It has on average paid out 11.3% per annum in its 45-year history to its members who are serving the forces.
The cash portion is generally between 6% and 7% and the rest of the payout is in the form of unit trusts.
What astonishes the fund management industry is that even when the markets are bad, the returns are superior compared to other funds.
For instance, in the years 1998 and 1999 when the stock market crashed and rebounded, LTAT declared a total payout of 13.5% and 15%, respectively. Many will remember 1998 as the time when most investors and funds were wiped out following the meltdown of the stock exchange.
In 2008, LTAT paid out 16% when the global markets were roiling under the weight of a financial crunch in the United States that had spread to the rest of the world.
Under the previous government, LTAT took on corporate transactions that other government funds such as Khazanah Nasional Bhd would shy away from. For instance, LTAT, together with Boustead Holdings Bhd , acquired two companies running the automated traffic enforcement system (AES) in 2015.
Both companies were associated with the Barisan Nasional government, particularly, the-then Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak.
The deal was done through Irat Properties Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of LTAT. The purchase price was never disclosed in detail until there was a change in government in May last year.
In August last year, details of the deal that was transacted at RM555mil came out after the government said it was taking over the companies. According to the former chairman of LTAT, Tan Sri Mohd Anwar Mohd Nor, LTAT was told by the Cabinet to take over the two companies.
And it was promised that the government would buy the two companies – ATES Sdn Bhd and Beta Tegap Sdn Bhd – at a 12% return per annum.  The new government is only prepared to fork out RM555mil to take over the AES. 
In 2013, LTAT’s 60% subsidiary, Boustead Holdings, paid RM130mil to a private company to purchase three parcels of land in Klang after a controversy broke out between two personalities linked to Umno and Najib. The two are former Selangor Wanita Umno leader Raja Datuk Ropiaah Raja Abdullah and Deepak Jaikishan, who was aligned to Najib’s family.
The head honcho of LTAT, Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin, was a Najib loyalist. He stood with the former Prime Minister and was the chairman of the board of the scandal-plagued 1Malaysia Development Bhd.
On Thursday, the Auditor-General revealed a black mark in the financial track record of LTAT. It had overstated its profit for the year ended Dec 31, 2017 by RM291.61mil.
This is because LTAT booked in profits from an incomplete disposal and did not provide adequate diminution in value for shares.
The net effect on its accounts is that LTAT’s profit for 2018 is down to RM370.56mil compared to RM662.17mil previously. The accumulated profits of LTAT went into a deficit position of RM31.6mil.
Prudence is paramount when one finalises the accounts of funds. In this case, the Auditor-General is right to say the profits would be lower, so be it. The previous management and the board should accept the fact.
Lodin has resigned from all positions in LTAT and  has been replaced by Nik Amlizan Mohamed. Apart from Lodin, board members who had passed the accounts for the period ending December 2017 are also responsible. Those still serving on the board of LTAT should resign.
The bigger question is whether there are more skeletons in the closet within the group of companies that LTAT controls.
The umbrella holding company for LTAT is Boustead Holdings, which, in turn, controls several companies including Boustead Plantations Bhd , Affin Holdings Bhd  and Pharmaniaga Bhd .  
For 2018, Boustead Holdings swung into a loss of RM469.2mil due to the poor performance of its subsidiaries that are involved in ship repair and maintenance works and the plantation segment. It was the first time Boustead Holdings has recorded a loss since 2001.
Will Boustead Holdings and its subsidiaries record more losses? Are there provisions to be made for transactions done in the previous years? The company has also proposed changes to its constitution to shareholders.
In a 41-page document, Boustead Holdings has proposed a litany of changes, including limiting the term of the managing directors, tightening share options to directors and terms of financing.
It is easy to fathom why Boustead Holdings’ constitution needs to be changed. The company was under the leadership of Lodin for more than 36 years. It is far too long a time for one person to be helming a company.
Boustead Holdings is not as badly mismanaged as Felda and FGV Holdings Bhd. But with a new team at the helm of LTAT and Boustead Holdings, it is the best time to reveal all the shocks and surprises."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/revamps-needed-for-longterm-gain/,Revamps needed for long-term gain,Plantations,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"THE exposé of the mismanagement that has taken place at the various institutions has been staggering. The revelations of the shenanigans that took place in Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH), Felda and Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) showed the extent of how past dealings were made with disregard to proper governance and transparency.
Shady deals being struck and books being cooked were some of the findings at these institutions, which hid the extent of losses from the squandering of money to give the perception that all was well.
As for Felda, it was the reversal of fortune that was startling. Prior to the listing of its unit FGV Holdings Bhd, Felda was a profitable agency with little debt. The flotation of FGV Holdings on Bursa Malaysia saw Felda raising RM10.5bil, which it shared with FGV Holdings to give it a bump in cash reserves. Felda kept RM6bil of the  initial public offering proceeds, with FGV Holdings receiving RM4.5bil.
In both cases, the money was whittled away, with the debt at Felda ballooning from RM1.2bil in 2007 to RM14.4bil 2017. To add salt to its financial wounds, Felda kept losing money after the listing of FGV Holdings.
Such woes have necessitated an injection of RM6.23bil by the government and precipitated a complete overhaul of how Felda will be run. It is hoped that by doing so, the fortunes of settlers and that of the agency will improve in time.
Felda is not the only agency that has shown problems of malfeasance within the organisation. TH revealed shocking past practices by management that have forced the government and its agencies to assist the ailing fund with a rescue package.
The package includes a special-purpose vehicle under the Finance Ministry taking over TH’s under-performing assets and issuing sukuk and preference shares totalling RM19.9bil to TH as the purchase consideration. TH is targeting to complete the rehabilitation of the assets in seven years.
TH’s problems are not recent as former Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz in 2015 had said the value of TH’s reserves had become negative, meaning the fund’s assets were not sufficient to meet all its financial obligations.
But the fund then used depositors’ money to pay high dividends in order to keep up with the illusion that the fund was performing well.A clean-up of TH has been underway and to show just how the financial scandal has affected TH, it was announced last week that the fund would give a hibah or dividend of 1.25% to its depositors for its financial year 2018 (FY18). This is the lowest on record.
“The Pakatan Harapan government inherited TH from the previous government in a sad state,” said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Seri Dr Mujahid Yusof Rawa at a press conference at the Putrajaya Islamic Complex last week.
He said TH suffered from “poor governance and mismanagement” under the previous Barisan Nasional government, prompting the need for financial restructuring, which was completed in December last year.
But the stream of bad news did not end there. On Thursday, LTAT, which manages the Armed Forces’ retirement fund, was found to have overstated its net profit by 44% for its FY17 ended Dec 31. This was because of the non-compliance of two previous transactions with the Financial Reporting Standards.
The financial discrepancy resulted in LTAT’s net profit being reported at RM662.2mil previously, compared to the actual amount of only RM370.7mil.
Given the re-adjustment to its accounts, the Armed Forces retirement fund has hinted that its FY18 financial results would be negatively impacted, but did not say whether its dividend payment would be lower.
In a statement issued on Thursday, LTAT’s chief executive Nik Amlizan Mohamed said the National Audit Department had issued a qualified opinion pertaining to Note 33 and 13 of LTAT’s FY17 financial statements.
As per the qualified opinion, Note 33 refers to the proceeds from land sales worth RM202.7mil, which should not have been taken into account in the FY17 financial statements. Meanwhile, as for Note 13, it involves unrecognised impairments of RM88.9mil for two stocks held by LTAT.
In its FY17 financial statement, LTAT only recognised a total impairment of RM18.46mil instead of RM107.36mil.
Overall, with the re-adjustment of LTAT’s FY17 net profit to RM370.56mil, the fund’s retained earnings would drop drastically to a retained loss of RM31.6mil from a positive retained earnings of RM259.99mil previously. Nik Amlizan said that the release of LTAT’s FY18 accounts has been delayed, following the late submission of its FY17 accounts.
A revamp of such funds and institutions should pay off in time, given the improvements in the performance and annual dividends given by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in recent years.
In the early 2000s, the EPF declared meagre dividends and that prompted calls for a revamp in how the EPF managed itself.
An overhaul was conducted and the EPF, which used to invest in around 400 stocks, cut that down to about 100. This allowed its portfolio to focus on better-quality counters to invest in. Furthermore, an asset-allocation strategy was devised to spread out its investments and more money was invested overseas, which has helped translate to the high dividends members have been enjoying in recent years.Related stories:Felda gets lifelineFGV sees urgent need to discuss land lease deal"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/how-one-championship-raised-us250mil-from-investors/,How ONE Championship raised US$250mil from investors,Investment,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"SEVERAL months ago, I had the precious opportunity to enjoy breakfast with Michael Moritz (chairman of Sequoia Capital), Douglas Leone (global managing partner of Sequoia Capital), and Shailendra Singh (managing director of Sequoia Capital) in Singapore. 
Not only was I blown away by their ability to drill down to the most important drivers of our business, but I was so impressed by their humility and kindness. 
Michael and Doug are legends for having built Sequoia Capital into what is arguably Silicon Valley’s most successful venture capital firm in history. Their track record of investing in startups is truly extraordinary: Apple, YouTube, Google, Yahoo, Instagram, WhatsApp, Airbnb, Oracle, Linkedin, Cisco, and many other startups that went on to become famous companies.
At the end of breakfast, they told me that I was an authentic founder. I did not quite fully grasp the depth of their words. Amazingly, a few hours later, Sequoia Capital graciously offered to lead the next round with a US$100mil investment at a valuation in the billion dollar range. And the rest is history as they say. (Of course, they were already shareholders from the prior round, and had already completed months of due diligence on our key metrics, financials, and leadership team). 
By their definition, an authentic founder is an entrepreneur whose calling in life is that particular business. Michael and Doug said that when an authentic founder leads a great business model with a huge market opportunity, the equity has the potential to compound at high rates naturally over long periods of time. It is such a simple, yet brilliant concept. I will forever be full of gratitude for Sequoia Capital’s wisdom and belief.
In my case, martial arts is what I love. And my martial arts is who I am. For as long as I can remember, martial arts has been my greatest passion in life. And I will be doing martial arts until my last day on earth. 
Today, ONE Championship has raised over US$250mil. When people ask me for the secret to successful fundraising from the world’s most blue-chip institutional investors like Sequoia, Temasek and Greenoaks Capital, I tell them that it was a lot of good luck. 
I am not being modest; it is the truth. Of course, there are many things you can do as an entrepreneur to maximise your odds of success in raising capital. However, it really does often come down to timing and luck. 
On the good luck side, I am blessed with the greatest business partners in the world in Saurabh Mittal (ONE’s vice-chairman) and Hua Fung Teh (ONE’s group president). Bar none, Saurabh is the sharpest strategic thinker and greatest win-win dealmaker that I know in life. Hua Fung also ranks among the best business minds that I know. 
Our banker Rippledot also played a critical role in the process. For me, Rippledot ranks among the world’s best investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in terms of client focus and TMT market expertise.
Barring good luck, for anyone who wants to take “other people’s money”, a few key attributes are necessary. I have spoken about authenticity above. 
There are other usual business metrics, such as having a good business model, a large economic moat and a clear vision, strategy, and execution plan.
Over and above that, character and the uniqueness of the product will vastly dictate how scalable and sticky a business will become. 
I list some of the important values that has helped ONE raise US$250mil. 
> Integrity:  For me, integrity means doing the right thing even when no one is watching. Do your best to live in a way that would make your mom proud. Integrity is essential for success in life and it is no different for investors. Before these blue chip institutional investors invested in ONE, they did a massive amount of due diligence on my character, my values and my past. Of course, they looked into my achievements too, but integrity was first and foremost. Investors want to see that integrity permeates throughout an entire organisation. Trust is the foundation of every successful relationship in the world. It is no different here. Without a doubt, integrity is the most important value at ONE for everyone who works here.
> The PHD factor:  If investors are going to invest in a startup, they want to know that their capital is in good hands. Experience and domain expertise are not the only key success factors. I look for the PHD factor too; I love working with people who are Poor, Hungry and Determined in spirit and attitude. Irrespective of one’s position in life, I believe that it is best to work with a PHD factor. To this day, I work, hustle, and fight as if my life were hanging in the balance. I don’t take anything for granted. Dreams are great, but nothing beats old-fashioned hard work. I need to see this rare PHD trait in a person before I make an offer.
> Outstanding product:  I have spent thousands of hours on our product and I still work on our product as if it is day one. First and foremost, I am a product-driven founder. My team will tell you that our product is an obsession for me. I look at every detail maniacally. I study every athlete on our roster for his/her character, athletic ability, world championship potential, marketability and more. I look over every fight on every fight card before I give the final green light. I’m even obsessed about the order of fights on a fight card to ensure that our fans get the very best experience. I study every pixel on our global broadcast with the proverbial magnifying glass. I walk throughout the stadium on fight night looking for minute details that can be improved and/or where we have made mistakes. I still watch every video produced by our team. 
The list of things that I do for our product is endless, but these examples are just some of the things that I do. In a word, our product is my obsession. It is not an accident that ONE has one of the best products of any global sports media giant today. My team and I are singularly obsessed with producing the greatest product in sports for our fans. 
> Huge addressable market:  Investors love a huge addressable market, but it must be realistically attainable. In our case, Asia has been the home of martial arts for the last 5,000 years. There are 4 billion people in Asia, and 2 billion of them are in the same time zone. ONE is a celebration of Asia’s greatest cultural treasure and its deep-rooted Asian values of integrity, humility, honour, respect, courage, discipline, and compassion. 
Martial arts has been a part of our history, culture, values, and tradition in virtually every country in Asia. The biggest movie heroes of any genre are Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and Donny Yen – and they are all martial artists. There is no reason why Asia cannot produce its first multibillion dollar global sports media property in history; and ONE Championship is already on track to achieve it.
> Transparency:  As an entrepreneur, I have learned that telling potential investors the good, bad, and ugly about my business is the best way to build trust. Every company has flaws. Every company has challenges. Every company has risks. Investors respect it when you walk them through the negatives and explain how you intend to overcome those negatives. So, when speaking to investors, my strong advice is to be open and transparent at all times. Of course, every fact and every figure must be 100% accurate and supported by data. Investors will do their own homework to verify everything, but my team and I always strive to be 100% open with all data and numbers.
In summary, it doesn’t take magic to raise capital. Anyone can do it. Just remember that integrity, hard work, and transparency will go a long way to maximizing your chances of success at capital-raising.

THE move by the federal government to introduce a new ship-to-ship (STS) transfer hub in the waters of Johor has many positives, although execution will be key. To recap, the plan is to build what is being touted as the world’s largest STS hub off Johor’s Port of Tanjung Pelepas. The project also entails the entry of Hutchison Ports as a 30% shareholder of the proposed STS hub. This indicates a certain level of professionalism that should come into that area of business, where a lot of opaqueness exists currently. For example, it is difficult to know for sure how many actual operators of STS are presently running in the Johor Straits. It is also unclear who all the owners are (although some are clear) and what kind of revenues and profits they earn. What is impressive about the new STS hub is its grand plan. In a nutshell, it will have mooring structures to berth vessels without the need for piers or docks and at a lower cost for shippers. It will be able to accommodate up to 30 vessels at one time. 
The hub, expected to be ready in 2021, will also be able to store nine million tonnes of petroleum products. None of the existing STS operators can come close to this. It will be in a position to win business from Singapore’s Tuas mega port. It is only logical for the new hub to eventually replace the scattered list of current STS operators there. The government of Malaysia is likely to gain from increased taxes and fees. But execution will be key. Indications are that the project will be privately funded. It should also be revealed that existing STS operator, KA Petra Sdn Bhd, was chosen as the party to lead this project and that more needs to be revealed about its credentials as the major owner of the new STS hub. 
 
Changes at Hock Heng
A SUBSTANTIAL block of shares has changed hands in nondescript Hock Heng Stone Industries Bhd , a company that is into the manufacture and distribution of dimension stones.
The Low family used to control the company with a 45.47% stake. Their interest in Hock Heng Stone was held through a private vehicle, Jasa Maju Sdn Bhd.
Yesterday evening, Jasa Maju ceased to be a substantial shareholder of Hock Heng Stone.
Instead, two private companies emerged as substantial shareholders holding a total of 43.43%. The two companies are Shi Ji Dong Fang (M) Sdn Bhd that emerged with a 29.78% stake and Paddington Hospitality Sdn Bhd, which announced that it had acquired a 13.64% interest in Hock Heng Stone.
Although Shi Ji Dong Fang and Paddington Hospitality have different offices, it could not be a mere coincidence that they emerged with substantial blocks of shares in Hock Heng Stone  on the same day.
So far, the three Low brothers are still sitting on the board of the company. However, they are joined by two new appointments that were announced early this month.
One of them is Tengku Sulaiman Shah from the Selangor royalty who was appointed as independent director on April 4. The other new appointment to Hock Heng Stone is an Indonesian, Dr Suntoro Tjoe, who was also appointed on the same day.
Are the new board appointments representing the new companies that have emerged in Hock Heng Stone? Are Shi Ji Dong Fang and Paddington Hospitality connected? Ironically, Hock Heng Stone undertook a private placement of 10% of its shares in March this year. The shares were placed out at 55 sen each, raising RM4.4mil. The money was used to pay off debts and as working capital.
It begs the question as to why Hock Heng Stone undertook a share placement in March only to see the private company holding the controlling bock of shares divesting its stake a month later.

 


More certainty for airport REIT 
MALAYSIA Airports Holdings Bhd ‘s (MAHB) operating agreements (OA) with the government to operate, manage and maintain the country’s 39 airports have been extended by 35 years to 2069. This adds some level of certainty to the impending formation of the world’s first airport real estate investment trust (REIT), first proposed by Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng during his Budget 2019 speech last year. Moving forward, the government hopes to raise RM4bil from selling a 30% stake in the REIT to private investing institutions. 
To be sure, the government owns all the physical assets of the airports nationwide, while MAHB is the concessionaire that operates, manages and maintains them. The move to establish the REIT will also see the local aviation industry going towards what analysts call a user-funding model instead of a model which uses the government’s coffers for airport upgrades. 
In its announcement yesterday, MAHB said the OA extension would give it the rights to manage the existing 39 airports and short take-off landing airports in Malaysia until Feb 11, 2069. The existing OA was for 25 years from Feb 12, 2009. The current OA and lease agreements will be superceded and replaced with four new OA, which are the OA for KLIA, OA for designated airports in Peninsular Malaysia, OA for Sabah airports and OA for Sarawak airports (new OAs) and new lease agreements, respectively. Interestingly, MAHB shares started to move upwards shortly before this news broke and was trading 14 sen higher at RM6.75 at mid-day. It was on the top of the gainers’ list when the market resumed after the mid-day break. Notably, the share price of the airport operator had fallen over the past week on concerns surrounding the impact of an impending passenger departure levy. Earlier this week, the Finance Ministry said that a departure levy would be imposed on those flying out of the country."

In fact, it has been identified as one of the 31 strategic initiatives under our Transformation Project”.He points out that “Felda will not be able to complete its full turnaround plan until this new business model (as mapped out by the White Paper) is fully implemented”.The White Paper also highlighted that Felda would be managing its settlers’ land under a long-term lease under the new business model.Megat Zaharuddin says the reality of the industry is that Felda settlers, who are heavily involved in oil palm and rubber plantations, are in for the maximisation of yields from their land and the cost optimisation from the economies of scale in order to cope with the volatilities of the commodity prices in the global markets.“We feel that most of our settlers will need the certainty of at least an assured minimum income.“Therefore, Felda under its new business model will try to iron out as many details as possible in order to achieve our targeted goals within a certain timeframe,” explains Megat Zaharuddin.Related stories:FGV sees urgent need to discuss land lease dealRevamps needed for long-term gain"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/what-is-the-longterm-growth-model-of-asia/,What is the long-term growth model of Asia?,Economy,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"AS the weather warms up in the Northern Hemisphere from a bitter winter, there is concern that the world is moving towards a synchronised global slowdown. This is a massive contrast to only a year ago, when the consensus  was optimistic of a synchronised global recovery. 
This slowdown is mostly man-made – the biggest dampener being the US-China trade tensions, which aggravated the cyclical Chinese slowdown last year on the back of reforms aimed at getting a grip on the debt overhang. As Brexit moved from tragedy to farce, Europe also slowed when populist unrests sparked off a huge internal debate on how to deal with the new unknowns.   
Right-wing populists focus on European fears of being overwhelmed by the growing tide of migrants. Left-wing populists want more welfare spending that right wing conservatives reject.  
Meanwhile, all emerging markets are all going through the throes of major elections or leadership changes, with major elections being called in India and Indonesia. Tensions in the Middle East and North Africa have worsened with civil wars erupting in Libya, Algeria and Yemen.  
So far, East and South Asia are still the growth poles in global GDP league, enjoying GDP growth above 5% per annum, but there are signs of flagging growth. The WTO is forecasting that global trade growth in 2019 at 2.6% will be slower than global GDP growth of 3.3% as forecast by IMF – a signal that recession maybe on the horizon. 
For some time, it has been apparent that the Asian Export Growth Model is already nearing the end of its shelf life.  Indeed, with the arrival of robotics plus protectionism, Asia can no longer rely on a Cheap Labour+Export driven model.   The US and European markets have reached maturity in terms of consumption power, whilst protectionism and automation mean that production is shifting back to home markets. 
Consequently, Asian economies will have to look to their own domestic consumption to sustain growth. But for a number of reasons, most Asian governments are not ready to make that major policy shift.  
The Peterson Institute of International Economics, together with the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, has produced a recent book on “Toward a New Long-term Growth Model for Asia (PIIE, 2018)”. In the face of secular stagnation in the advanced countries, what are the policy options and growth models in Asia?   
First, the symptoms of secular stagnation in Europe and America are already evident in Japan and South Korea, which are both suffering from higher dependency ratios (more retirees to support by existing work force), as well shrinking work force. Declining interest rates, higher domestic debt burdens, and lack of domestic investments all point towards lower productivity levels, which then suggest lower future growth.  
In the last 30 years, Asia has also begun to show symptoms of the free market financial disease of growing inequality. Since the 1970s, there was a swing from paying labour more to rewarding capital and short-term speculation. To illustrate, between 1973-2013, productivity in the US went up 74.4%, whereas hourly wages went up only 9.2%.   
This meant that workers were paid peanuts, whereas corporate profits (and salaries of CEOs) rose disproportionately. Thomas Piketty and others show that historically concentrations in finance and landed property account for much of the inequality.   
The political backlash against this inequality lie in the populist vote for change, blaming all ills on globalisation, immigrants and foreigners. 
Asians, who have been exporting in the last 40 years not just their best products, as well as their top talent, to the United States, are now forced to re-think their own priorities. It is one thing to sell goods in exchange for dollars, but to be insulted and demeaned for causing America’s woes, begs a major policy shift.  
These policy shifts are already showing up in subtle changes in Asian global supply chain. First, it is not just China diversifying through outward foreign investment, but many manufacturers currently based in China are already shifting to lower-wage production centres, such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Philippines, to hedge their geographical risks. 
Second, almost all are beginning to upgrade digitally, led by Asia’s own digital platforms, such as Alibaba, Tencent and Indonesia’s Go-Jek. The Asian global supply chain is becoming more services oriented and more regionally networked, as the main engine of growth diversifies from exports to the West to exports within Asia.  Domestic consumption growth are clearly the major strategies of the population giants, China, India and Indonesia, but the 100 million class economies – Bangladesh, Philippines and Vietnam are also set to benefit from home market strengths. This leaves the smaller economies struggling to find their niche in the new multi-polar, diverse and politically divided world.	
If there is one blind spot in this review, it is the lack of appreciation how climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy will fundamentally change the consumption and production pattern in Asia as a whole. The irrefutable big picture is that as energy source move from fossil fuels to alternative energies, there will be a major redistribution of power from former oil producers to the most energy efficient economies. This is because the US emergence as a major energy producer will keep oil prices low, despite efforts of OPEC to limit production.  
In short, as China and India move into middle-income consumption levels, there will be bigger strains on natural resources, particularly forests, marine reefs and food production. Those who move up the green path best will have the capacity to compete on the goods and services everyone needs to deal with the worst effects of climate change. The right path will be found through diverse competition and innovation, not any centrally planned solution.  Diversity is Asia’s strength.
Higher Asian consumption is both an opportunity but also a threat, especially to our scarce natural resources. How each individual economy adapts to this new environment of worsening climate change, and the need to provide jobs and food for all, will be the major challenge for Asia.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/my-journey-in-building-an-analytics-centre-of-excellence/,My journey in building an Analytics Centre of Excellence,Business News,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"BIG Data was introduced in the mid-2000s when there was a realisation that traditional Business Intelligence tools could not manage the size and complexities of data generated from Web 2.0. Big Data has since generated a lot of excitement and some have even touted it as the silver bullet required to end world hunger. 
But the ability to use data for decision making has in fact been around for much longer; we’re talking 7,000 years ago in the Mesopotamian era when accounting was first introduced to record the growth of herds and crops.
So, analytics is certainly not new. But if it has been around for so long, why is there still skepticism and challenges faced out there on analytics? 
Let’s address that by looking examples on how Centres of Excellence (COEs) function in Malaysia. COEs are designed to  address specific business problems. Some COEs are designed to generate insights to serve customers better, reduce customer churn or the ability to measure customer’s propensity to buy a product. Some shared services analytics COEs supports operational and regulatory reporting. While some are also designed as R&D centers, experimenting with cutting edge Internet of Things (IoT) solutions or used as talent incubators. In my view, analytics COEs should be designed to address current known problems as well as future yet to be known problems. This is one of the reasons  we see many COEs starting off strong but failing to sustain when the problem statement changes.
Let me explain further. 
The core function of analytics is to help businesses make informed decisions by finding patterns in data or alerting the business of an impending problem. However, the business landscape is ever-changing and the problems we solve today, may not be the problems we solve tomorrow. 
You might be thinking “isn’t this the case for all solution implementation?” 
Well, no. Let’s take an enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation as an example. The problem an ERP tool sets to solve is one of standardisation, efficiency and automation. This is done by designing, implementing and automating business processes using tech. Once complete, the business processes stay largely consistent for the foreseeable future, and the needs for today and tomorrows’ are met. 
Because of this, it is necessary that an analytics COE is built with a focus on agility in order to manage change. I would define agility as the ability to define a problem early on, test solution feasibility through prototyping and pivot the solution given the feedback. Continue to iterate until you get a  “minimum viable product” (MVP). An MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy the customers and which can be used to get more feedback for future iterations.
So that sets that stage. What then  are my three key learnings from building Star Media Group’s analytics COE?
Firstly, it’s to define value upfront and get the right stakeholders on the bus. Value is hard to define and we still need a north star to rally the organisation together. Commonly, value is defined as either revenue generation or cost reduction. 
My view is that the value of analytics is not easily attributable to revenue or cost. Hence we need to look at it in a slightly different way. As told by my boss, use analytics as a means to change perspective and mindset of the organisation. In the same process, the organisation will naturally align to its intended objective and will drive up the necessary KPIs. For example, in Star, analytics is  used to provide competitive, product and social insights to the go-to-market team, differentiating the value that we bring to our clients. Or use readership behaviour as a feedback for content creation. 
Secondly, culture of experimentation. Analytics is not a crystal ball to predict the future. It can tell you insights only through historical patterns or previously unavailable data points. This is a process that has to happen iteratively. Give it a business problem, test it with data, refine it and test again. Repeat until we get a cut of the results or conclude that it is a problem that cannot be resolved yet. This experimentation culture must be percolated throughout the entire organisation — the  techie, data scientist, customer care agent  and everyone in the business side  all have to be part of this process. The good news is that more often than not, this cycle will uncover additional insights that wasn’t part of the original objective. My personal mantra is “Test and Iterate” or “Fail and Pivot”.
Thirdly, finding the right talent. The perfect analytics practitioner has to understand the business domain to unlock value, be a master in statistics to uncover patterns and a tech guru to manage the data pipeline. This perfect person is the unicorn that  doesn’t exist. We should instead build a team around these  three pillars. 
In Star, I call them the Suits, the Statisticians and the Techies. The Suits are the go-to-market team that engages the business to action upon the insights and to unlock business value through process improvement or change management. The Statisticians are my data scientists who helps to crunch the numbers and build machine learning algorithms. The Techies are responsible to source, store, curate and manage the entire data repository for  use  by the Suits and the Statisticians. Talent and teamwork  are definitely the key to success, as Steve Jobs said: “Great things in business are never done by one person. They’re done by a team of people”.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/13/asias-dealmaking-ong-brothers/,Asia’s deal-making Ong brothers,Investment,"Saturday, 13 Apr 2019",,"BLACK Monday, the Black Friday mini crash in 1989, the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 subprime crisis. Asia’s deal-making Ong brothers have come a long way to becoming household names in private equity.
Malaysian brothers Richard and Charles Ong had somewhat similar career paths, rising to senior positions in giant firms before taking the leap of faith to set up their own investment firm RRJ Capital, based in Hong Kong and Singapore.
It turned out to be the right move after all, as RRJ has grown to become among Asia’s largest private equity groups with over US$12bil in capital under management, and it is expected to hit over US$15bil by next year.
Richard is chairman and CEO of the firm while his younger brother Charles is co-chairman and co-CEO.
StarBizweek had a chat with Richard and Charles when they were in Kuala Lumpur recently, after having completed their latest acquisition of global airline catering and on board retail provider Gategroup Holding AG.
They also indicated their interest to invest up to RM5bil in Malaysia, focusing on sectors such as insurance and infrastructures including water, transportation and logistics.
 
Who they are
From St John’s Institution to the Ivy League and Wall Street, the Ong brothers, who hail from Johor, had illustrious paths to where they are today.
Richard was a civil and environmental engineering graduate from Cornell University in 1986. He got his MBA from the University of Chicago three years later after he started working in Wall Street.
He had spent a year doing engineering in 1987 and soon felt that it was not his calling, which then led him to take up an MBA.
“I graduated on the Black Friday (1989). It was terrible. The market crashed but it was a good experience and a fantastic one working in Wall Street back then.
“We slugged off many long hours working in Wall Street and then, eventually had the chance to come back to Asia where I ended up in Hong Kong,” said Richard.
He began his career in finance at the then Chase Manhattan Bank and Prudential-Bache International and was in Goldman Sachs for over 15 years where he was based in Singapore and Beijing.
He was the investment bank’s Singapore president and a member of its Asian management committee.
“I’ve been working in the industry for a long time and in 2006, I was in Beijing for almost four years and then decided that it’s time for me to move on,” he said.
Richard co-founded Hopu Fund with fellow Goldman alumni Fang Fenglei in Beijing. It was a US$2.5bil private quity fund.
It was at Hopu that he became famous for his rapid-fire investment style. He left Beijing in 2010 to start RRJ in Hong Kong and Singapore.
As for Charles, he obtained his degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and then obtained his MBA from Harvard Business School.
He began working at Lazard Freres & Co in New York and relocated to Singapore in 1995 to help kick off its operations in Asia.
He then worked for Deutsche Bank from 1998 to 2002 before joining Singapore’s state investment firm Temasek Holdings for 10 years where he held senior positions such as senior managing director of special projects, chief investment officer and chief strategy officer. 
He was also the CEO of Seatown Holdings International, Temasek’s global investment subsidiary.
“New York was where we started most of our careers. The United States was a place to learn and as time passes, you try to move back closer to Malaysia and we either landed in Hong Kong or Singapore. “One thing leads to another and it’s been an interesting experience for all of us. Like Richard, I also started in the banking business but I decided to go to the buy side in 2002.
“During that time, we had an opportunity to redefine Temasek and it was a journey to come out and transform the investment thesis and how you look at the world and to us, emerging markets particularly Asia was an area that people kind of left it as a graveyard, particularly post-1998. I think it was a fantastic time to invest,” said Charles.
Temasek seconded Charles to RRJ in 2011. He left in January the next year to be in RRJ permanently.
Charles is also on MIT’s board of trustees, the first Malaysian to sit on the board. His son is currently studying there as well while his daughter is a student at Stanford University.
One of Richard’s daughters, on the other hand, is a student at Yale University.
 
RRJ’s investments and investors
RRJ, which stands for the initials of Richard’s three daughters, focuses on growth capital and state-owned enterprises investments. It has investments in Europe, the United States, China, Singapore and Australia.
Sectors that it particularly prefer are insurance, healthcare, food, logistics and also real estate, but mainly residential in China.
“Of course the big ones for us as well is financial institutions. Our main focus lately has always been insurance.
“We own one of the largest insurance companies in Europe called NN Group NV, which historically used to be ING Insurance. We’re the largest shareholder with a stake of around 10%.
“We also invested close to US$700mil in a US insurance company called Voya Financial Inc. It used to be ING USA, We’ve also been involved in insurance companies in China like the famous Ping An and China Pacific Insurance,” he said.
As for hospitals, RRJ is involved directly and indirectly in over 30 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand and also some investments in Singapore.
On the logistics front, he said RRJ is very focused on China due to its growing economy.
Apart from NN Group NV, among other top investments by RRJ are a 100% stake in Gategroup with US$1.95bil invested, S$1.74bil in Cheniere Energy Inc, 9.85% in NN Group at US$1.69bil, US$1.18bil in Global Aviation, US$831mil in China Logistics Property Holding Co Ltd, US$704mil in Logan Property Holdings Ltd and US$587mil in Sinopec Marketing Co Ltd.
“We also own the largest privately-owned juice company in China that makes packaged juice to serve on airlines or bullet trains, which also makes us one of the biggest juice producers in China,” said Richard.
RRJ has raised three funds since its inception – RRJ 1 at around US$2.5bil, RRJ 2 at US$3.6bil and RRJ 3 at US$4.5bil.
About 55% of it’s investors are from the United States, 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and about 20% from Asia and these comprises state pension funds and corporates such as Boeing, Shell and Intel.
“Overall, we’re very focused on investing in what I call, the key bricks and mortar businesses in the world.
“We’ve raised funds of about US$12bil now and we’re raising another one which will bring us above US$15bil and coupled with the co-investors, effectively we will have over US$20bil.
“We also have no problems investing in the western world because we lived there for a long time so it’s natural for us. To sit on their boards is also never a big deal for us,” Richard said.
 
Investment philosophy
Having started their finance career in investment banking during the times of a stock market crash and then on to the 1997 economic crisis, that’s where the Ong brothers learnt a lot.
“It teaches you about investment, risks, risk control, managing currencies and exposures where there was a mismatch of currencies, borrowing short term versus long term.
“A lot of companies were caught because their assets are long term and yet they borrow short term. These are the fundamental things you will learn in the world of corporate finance but people practice it differently. That’s one of the issues we had in 1997,” said Richard. 
“The technical skills part is easy. That you can learn in school or when you get your degree. We’ve made over 100 investments in our lives all over the world and we’ve done some good deals, some not so good deals to be honest. That’s part of life.
“One thing we do realise is, we’re not good in investing in small companies, we’re better in investing bigger companies and make them really big. 
“We like to create what we call national champions in other words, the largest company in that country. We like to invest and create regional champions like the biggest company in Asean., or for that matter we like to invest in companies like Gategroup which is a global champion, so we always identify them and the main thing for us is their ability to grow from x to 3x in terms of size,” said Richard.
For RRJ ultimately, the main thing is going back to the very basic point – human relationship – actually dealing with people and the ability to interact and come up with a fair deal.
“If it’s a one sided deal, if you win and they lose, you’re not going to do a lot of deals in the long term.
“You have to do a deal where ultimately both sides end up in a win-win situation. Of course, some may win a bit more but at least it’s not one-sided.
“It’s important when you sit down and negotiate and work on deals, it’s really a relationship in trying to bring together some of the key elements of a deal,” he said.
But it does not end there as one has to deal with management after the deal and this is where it is important to have a relationship with all stakeholders like the government, employees and the management.
Unlike the Indian industrialist Ratan Tata who can own a business for a very long period, RRJ sticks to its roots of a private equity firm where it can only own a business for a certain amount of years, following which it has to exit, which is why it deems stakeholder relationship vital.
 
Billion-dollar success
With a small team of only 30 people in both Hong Kong and Singapore, RRJ has over US$12bil in capital under management and that figure is still growing.
The secret of it all? Trying to be like Warren Buffett in keeping things simple.
Richard said RRJ always try to keep things simple and looking at Buffett and his investments, they are all very simple, structured and makes perfect sense.
“A lot of people think this is rocket science. It’s not. Try to have a look at things a bit longer term and see how you can maximise the value of the company at the end of the day.
“There are all kinds of risks like a meltdown, global financial crisis, or a national risk like what Turkey is going through right now or industry risks like if you’re having a lot of Boeing 737 Max now, you’re in trouble.
“So we’re always thinking about risks as a part of our analysis and it’s an active, nimble monitoring all the time,” Richard said.
 
Interest in Malaysia
Richard revealed that RRJ is keen to park some of its funds in Malaysia, on the back of potential opportunities in long term investments given the new government. It is targeting about RM5bil of investments in Malaysia over the next few years.
Areas of focus include insurance, water infrastructure, transportation, logistics and food.
“We like infrastructure, long term infrastructure and it could be in the area of transportation, logistics or redevelopments for example the redevelopment of Subang Airport and the rapid transit system in Johor.
“We like to do it as a private finance initiative (PFI) or a public private partnership with the government because really at the end of the day, ultimately the assets belong to the government.
“So you do it either on built-operate-transfer or build-transfer-operate.
“We’re also quite keen in Malaysian insurance and we’re very focused on putting a significant amount of our capital,” said Richard.
He added that very few Malaysian companies have gone international as entrepreneurs are still very domestic.
While RRJ has no investments yet in Malaysia, Richard does have a personal stake of 5% in Alliance Bank.
He was one of the three individuals who bought into Langkah Bahagia Sdn Bhd from Lutfiah Ismail in April 2016, who is the single largest shareholder in the bank’s predecessor Alliance Financial Group  with an effective stake of 15.04%. Lutfiah is known to be an associate of Tun Daim Zainuddin.   
Langkah Bahagia owns 51% of Vertical Theme Sdn Bhd, which in turn, holds 29.06% of Alliance.
 
Prospects in Malaysia
Every government has its challenges, including Pakatan Harapan but having said that, Richard thinks the current administration is trying really hard.
“It’s not easy to turn things around. It’s like turning around a company. It’s never an easy thing and they do need like a lot of help from the private sector. 
“The government alone can’t do the job. Like any country, job creation is always still the private sector.
“But the government with the right policies are able to help to drive the investments. And this has to go from top down. It’s no point just the top doing it and the grassroots they hold things back,” he said. 
With competitions around the region such as Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Phillipines, he opined that Malaysia has to play to its strengths to be able to compete.
“They have the population. So we need to look at ourselves and ask, what are really our strengths? We can’t compete with them on population.
“So that’s where we have a great rule of law, language skills so we got to play the higher value right. We need to be competitive. The bureaucracy and the government needs to work hand in hand to make sure the right kind of investment comes into the country.
“Look at what China has done for the last 30 to 40 years. I mean they went from bicycling to now, amazing. They’re even ahead of us,” said Richard.
Charles said there is no reason why Malaysia, with a market of almost 32 million people, cannot compete with other countries in the region as Malaysians are fairly educated, the country has well built infrastructure and a very competitive cost base.
“We just have to put it in a better marketing position, get a few basic things, straighten and tighten it up a little bit.
“For us who are old enough to remember about Asian Tigers, it’s a term no longer used because we’re all being surpassed by China. But I think the global market is so big that you can find your own niche to do the right thing.“We need to find the right people, the right packages, do the execution and really define Malaysia, not only in terms of its own domestic market but rather in the regional capabilities if not global in certain niches.
He added that providing higher certainty for investors and making things easier and lesser friction are something that all investors look forward to.
In the long term, as long as a country has the right value system, the willingness to work hard and treasure the right things, Charles thinks that the economy will grow albeit in cycles.
“For us, it’s about finding great companies and bringing them to greater heights and finding talents we can work with. Malaysia is like any other market, lots of talents here,” Charles said.
“The government should also look into how to really value add. We’re a big agriculture country.
“Take palm oil for example, instead of just exporting raw palm oil, create by-products and turn it into higher value add. We export commodities but why don’t we try to look at ways that we can enhance the value add?”"

The combined company will produce an estimated 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), trailing only Exxon Mobil Corp among publicly traded companies, up from fourth. It expands Chevron's reach in two areas where U.S. energy output is breaking records: shale from the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). These have helped make the United States one of the world's largest energy exporters.

“Chevron now joins the ranks of the 'ultramajors' – and the big three becomes the big four,"" said Roy Martin, senior analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. ""The acquisition makes the majors’ peer group much more polarized. Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and BP are now in a league of their own.""

These companies are turning to shale and its revolutionary techniques of fracking, blasting sand and water into formations to extract oil. This is cheaper and produces oil more quickly than costlier offshore and LNG projects that take years to generate cash.

The shale oil-and-gas boom reversed a long decline in U.S. crude production and propelled the country to a record 12 million barrels a day (bpd), more than Russia and Saudi Arabia. The United States is also now the third-largest producer of LNG, super-cooled natural gas that enjoys record demand as a cheaper, cleaner alternative than coal for power generation.

The combined companies are expected to produce more than 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the United States this year and 3.9 million boepd globally, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the deal offers a ""compelling and unique fit"" because the companies operate in similar areas, both with holdings in shale, offshore, and LNG projects. Chevron also expects shale to generate profits for its pipeline, trading and refining units.

""We are the best company to combine with Anadarko and Anadarko is the best company to combine with us,"" Wirth said in an interview.

Chevron's pledge to restrain expenditures has made it a favorite among energy stocks, with its shares up 13.8 percent this year. It plans to sell some $15 billion in assets over time to offset the Anadarko deal.

Chevron shares fell 4.9 percent to $119.76 on Friday. Anadarko shares jumped 32 percent, reflecting the offer's 39 percent premium over Thursday's close. Before the deal, Chevron shares had gained 25 percent over the last two years, while Anadarko had dropped 23 percent. In that time, U.S. crude oil prices have risen 20 percent.

It is the oil industry's largest deal since Royal Dutch Shell bought BG Group in 2016, and it sparked speculation that other shale producers are in play. Shares of Noble Energy rose 7 percent, while Pioneer Natural Resources Co jumped more than 11 percent.

Chevron, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the shale bonanza, when more nimble independent producers such as Anadarko pioneered shale drilling technology and leased Permian acreage on the cheap. Analysts predict further consolidation as the smaller companies that revolutionized the industry through advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking have seen their stock prices languish and have curtailed spending due weak returns.

Chevron, which already has 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin, said the combined company would have a 75-mile (120-km)-wide corridor across the Permian's Delaware basin, on the Texas-New Mexico border.

""We will now see Chevron emerging as the clear leader among all Permian players, both in terms of production growth and as a cost leader,"" said Rystad Energy head of analysis Per Magnus Nysveen, noting that Anadarko's acreage is in the ""sweetest spot"" of the Delaware Basin.

Chevron also owns mineral rights under some of the Anadarko Permian properties, saving royalties others would have to pay, said Drillinginfo analyst Andrew Dittmar. He estimated Chevron is paying about $50,000 an acre for Anadarko's west Texas holdings.

The Permian produces about 4 million barrels per day, and is expected to hit 5.4 million bpd by 2023, according to IHS Markit, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.

BIG LNG PUSH

Anadarko also has a Mozambique LNG project, part of one of the industry's largest planned current investments, which Wirth said he still expects to move to final approval ""sooner rather than later"" this year. Expenses from that project are expected to reach $4 billion over several years.

The tie-up with Anadarko adds to Chevron's deepwater investments in the Gulf of Mexico and gives it a stake in growing production in the U.S. Rocky Mountains in Colorado.

The $65-per-share offer was structured as 75 percent stock and 25 percent cash, and the company will also take on $15 billion of Anadarko's debt.

""This deal seems perfect. Oil is on a rebound yet Anadarko's stock price has been stagnant,"" said Chris Widell, CEO of Sponte Resources, a Dallas, Texas-based private exploration and production company.

Occidental Petroleum Corp, another company with assets in the Permian, bid more than $70 per share for Anadarko and is now considering options, sources said.

Chevron said the deal would add to its free cash flow and profit one year after closing, if Brent crude, currently around $70, holds above $60 per barrel. The enterprise value of the deal is $50 billion..

Anadarko shareholders will receive 0.3869 shares of Chevron and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share. - Reuters"

The company on Wednesday shelved its Malaysia shares sale after talks with its bankers, without giving a reason. Discussions of the IPO revival are in early stages and the company’s earnings in the next two quarters will play a key role in deciding the timing, said the people, asking not to be named as the information is private.

“We will make the necessary announcement at the appropriate time,” QSR Brand’s Managing Director Mohamed Azahari Kamil said by phone on Thursday, declining to comment further. The company planned to raise as much as $600 million in the share sale, according to terms for the deal obtained by Bloomberg earlier.

A listing of that size would give a boost to first-time share sales in Malaysia, where fundraising via IPOs dropped to the lowest annual tally in at least a decade. Deals have amounted to just $3.85 million in 2019, from $40.5 million in the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

QSR started gauging investor demand for an IPO in March. At the time, the firm and its existing shareholders, including private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd., planned to offer as many as 1.5 billion shares, the earlier terms show. State-owned conglomerate Johor Corp. and a fund under Malaysia’s finance ministry also sought to sell shares, the terms show.

QSR operates more than 820 KFC restaurants in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Cambodia, as well as more than 470 Pizza Hut outlets in Malaysia and Singapore. The company also breeds chickens and produces sauces, branding itself as a “farm to fork” food operator. - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/philippine-rate-cut-is-on-table-in-may-governor-diokno-says/,"Philippine rate cut is on table in May, Governor Diokno says",Banking,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",10:48 AM MYT,"MANILA: The Philippines central bank is on course to cut its key rate as inflation cools, and policy easing will be on the table as soon as the May 9 meeting, Governor Benjamin Diokno said.

“It’s not a matter of whether we cut, it is when,” Diokno told Bloomberg Television’s Kathleen Hays in Washington D.C., where officials are gathered for the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 

“We are considering it. I’m sure that will be in the agenda in the next policy meeting.”

Consumer prices eased for a fifth consecutive month to 3.3 percent in March from a year earlier, with the average falling within the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target. 

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas left the benchmark rate unchanged at 4.75 percent at its last three meetings while waiting for inflation to be firmly entrenched in the target range.

The governor’s comments came as Philippine economic officials expect the delay in this year’s budget approval to have trimmed first-quarter growth by almost 1 percentage point. A reduction in banks’ reserve requirement ratio, which at 18 percent remains among the highest in the region, is on the table “all the time.”
“It’s a question of timing, which will be first, the rates cut or the cut in the reserve ratio,” said the governor.

Room for Easing
“Now that inflation has normalized, I think there’s a room for some easing or relaxation,” the governor said. “But we have to look at other threats,” he said, citing rising oil prices and the impact of the El Ni±o dry weather on food costs. Diokno is echoing some of the cautious tone of Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo, a four-decade veteran of the BSP.

The 71-year-old governor, a former economics professor and budget secretary, was appointed in March to complete the unfinished term of Nestor Espenilla who died of cancer. Diokno, whose term ends in 2023, was perceived as pro-growth and tolerant of a weaker currency.

When asked if he’s confident that the peso won’t come under attack when the Philippines starts easing, he said “we’re not scared of any attack because number one, our currency is based on floating exchange rate, so it will be determined by supply and demand of currency.” 

Diokno cited hefty foreign exchange reserves and robust dollar inflows from overseas Filipinos, tourism receipts and outsourcing revenue.

The peso fell as much as 0.5 percent in early trade on Friday, halting a two-day rally.

Behind The Curve
Last year, some analysts said Bangko Sentral was behind the curve after it started raising its key rate only in May, two months after inflation had accelerated to a five-year high.

Diokno assured the policy easing will happen at the right time. “As you know, monetary policy works with a lag, nine-month lag. If you cut rates now, it doesn’t make a difference the following day,” he said. “We will try to make it timely.”"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/watch-out-for-market-complacency-as-risks-mount/,Watch out for market complacency as risks mount,Markets,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",1:46 PM MYT,"HONG KONG: Asia’s equity rally has been largely bulletproof this year with the regional benchmark up about 10 percent in less than four months.

What might be more concerning is how calm the market has been -- volatility on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is now at a level last seen in October, just before the massive risk asset sell-off that sent stocks plunging 14 percent in less than three months.

For some investors, it’s not a question of if the rally will come to an end, but rather when, and that could be as soon as the second quarter.

“For the second quarter, we believe equity valuations are at risk,” said Unigestion Holding SA in a second-quarter macro investment report to clients. Higher valuations and expectations of disappointing earnings outlook amid concerns surrounding economic growth suggests that market have been complacent, the note added.

What concerns Unigestion is that while in the past three periods of slowdown or recession, the trigger for a recovery was a sharp improvement in economic conditions, that’s not the case this time: growth is decent yet decelerating.

Rather, the trigger was a combination of discount valuations coupled with a “significant change in tone” by developed market central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, the investment manager said. And both of those elements are at risk, it said.

Increased valuations
Indeed, forward valuations for both global and Asia stocks have surged since the end of the year. 

The blended forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio for both the MSCI All-Country World Index and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index have jumped 20 percent and 18 percent respectively from the December low. Both indexes have rallied more than 10 percent each this year.

Meanwhile, analysts’ earnings growth expectations have been steadily revised downwards so far this year for the MSCI World Index, down to 2 percent at the end of March from 5 percent at the start of the year, according to Unigestion.

Early earnings
Very early earnings results from Asia may also be starting to confirm this view.

Fast Retailing Co., operator of the Uniqlo clothing brand and shops, cut its annual profit forecast for the first time in three years after the market close on Thursday. Still, the shares rose.

In the U.S., Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper are a bit more optimistic for the fortunes of S&P 500 stocks, as rock-bottom estimates may give companies a better chance of surprising to the upside.

“S&P 500 companies that confirm analyst views that margin expansion will support second-half profit recovery may fare best,” they said in a report this week. 

“With sentiment highly skeptical, we think price reactions this earnings season could be as extreme as they were in response to fourth-quarter reports.”

It said on Friday that although FY19 will be a transition year for Inari for both its existing and new businesses, the group’s medium-term outlook remains promising, underpinned by 5G.

“Besides new 5G smartphones (on multifold increase in RF filters), Inari will also benefit from the inevitable growth in 5G infrastructure with its expertise in fibre-optics chips and optoelectronics. Any share price weakness presents buying opportunity. Maintain Buy.  Target price: RM1.80,” it said.

UOB Kay Hian Research said while Inari’s utilisation rate for RF testers (42% of group revenue) is only hovering at 60-65%, the group remains committed to its key customer’s capacity expansion plan (testers are consigned by this key customer) which will see additional testing capacity being added by 2019. 

“We are particularly positive on this as this implies that Inari’s RF customer is expecting a significant uptick in RF demand, likely from the imminent convergence of 5G, which would also directly benefit Inari given its niche-services in this space. 

Samsung’s latest introduction of the Galaxy S10 (5G) kick-started the 5G wave, and other premium smartphone brands will have to follow suit by introducing 5G phones either by this year or latest by next year, despite 5G telecommunications infrastructure still being at its infancy stages. 

While 5G phones could have a marginal earnings impact on Inari at the early stages (due to the phones’ high price points), the group’s major customer continuously consigns RF testers to Inari despite the current low utilisation rate of testers at 60-65%.

This suggests this major customer could be anticipating a sharp uptick in RF filters requirements once 5G takes off, which will require a multifold increase in RF filters for smartphones.

UOB Kay Hian Research said aside from Samsung, the US and Chinese premium smartphone players would be following suit and this would also lend strength to Inari’s RF demand. 

Besides a multiple-fold increase in RF filters expected in the new 5G smartphones, Inari will also benefit from the inevitable growth in 5G infrastructure with its expertise in fibre-optics chips and optoelectronics.

The research house said time was needed for its new business with a German customer. 

“For its existing operation, Inari’s new products ramp-up for this customer,  that is, 2D and 3D FR sensors, health sensors, and mini LEDs are still on modest volume. 

“With the recent takeover talks by private equity firms alongside lower earnings forecast mentioned in an ad-hoc statement by this customer, we also do not discount the potential slowdown in the new business development between Inari and this customer. 

“Note that Inari now expects to obtain the new P34 plant’s (680,000sf) certificate of completion and compliance (CCC) in June 2019 (instead of expediting by April 2019), with the exact timing for the commencement of production still in discussion at the moment. 

“All said, we believe Inari is the frontrunner to benefit from the outsourcing model by this customer should the latter adopt such modus operandi to boost its margins,” UOB Kay Hian Research said."

At RM44bil, this is a 32.8% reduction in the earlier cost of RM65.5bil.
The ECRL will be double track, starting from Kota Baru to Mentakab,Jelebu, Kuala Klawang, Bangi, Kajang, Putrajaya and ends in Port Klang. 
Below is the statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office on Friday:

The Government of Malaysia welcomes the signing of a Supplementary Agreement (SA) between Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL) and the China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), which will pave the way for the resumption of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project.

The SA, which covers the Engineering, Procurement, Construction & Commissioning (EPCC) aspects of the ECRL, was achieved after months of negotiations between the companies involved as well as the Governments of Malaysia and the People's Republic of China.

We are pleased to announce that the construction cost for Phases 1 and 2 of the ECRL has now been reduced to RM44 billion, a reduction of RM21.5 billion, from its original cost of RM65.5 billion. 

This reduction will surely benefit Malaysia and lighten the burden on the country’s financial position.

Further details of the improved deal will be provided during Monday’s press conference.”

Earlier this week, CIMB Equities Research said ECRL’s construction cost could be significantly reduced by as much as 48% to RM35bil.

The research house had stated it expected a realignment of the 688km line will involve a rerouting to Negeri Sembilan.

CIMB Research had stated that unless a new rail line is built, it believes that rerouting the ECRL to Negeri Sembilan (from Gombak to Mentakab and vice versa) implies an alternative alignment away from the mountainous Titiwangsa Range and a likely integration with KTMB’s existing rail line in Negeri Sembilan. 

Based on the original plans, 44 tunnels are to be constructed at various locations spanning over 50km. The longest tunnel (which is now likely to be scrapped) is the Genting Tunnel measuring 17.8km (37% of total tunnel length).

Companies under its coverage that have rail experience include IJM Corp, Sunway (via Sunway Construction) and WCT. An upside risk is larger-than-expected exposure of the ECRL project to local contractors.

StarBiz had reported the ECRL will adopt single-tracking instead of double-tracking as the passenger and freight traffic flow is expected to be low due to the sparse population and low investments in the states of Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan.

The ECRL is of strategic importance to China because the Kuantan Port-ECRL-Port Klang route shortens its trading route and cuts the time it takes to travel to the west of Peninsular Malaysia while eliminating the need to use the Singapore Port."

""The contract wins demonstrate Sapura Energy’s continued pursuit to deepen its presence in existing core markets, break into new markets and expand its scope of services.

""The growing orderbook is expected to increase asset utilisation for the Group and contribute to improving its financial performance,"" it said in a statement today.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/marc-affirms-tenagas-corporate-credit-rating-at-aaa/,MARC affirms Tenaga's corporate credit rating at AAA,Corporate News,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",3:30 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Rating Corporation (MARC) has affirmed its corporate credit rating on Tenaga Nasional Bhd  (TNB) at AAA and its sukuk rating on the power giant’s RM2bil Al-Bai’ Bithaman Ajil Bonds at AAAIS. 

It said on Friday the ratings outlook was stable. TNB’s ratings benefit from a two-notch uplift to reflect MARC's assessment of a high likelihood of government support premised on TNB’s standalone corporate credit rating of AA/Stable. 

“The support assessment also considers the government’s indirect majority ownership in TNB which provides it with considerable leeway to influence the utility company’s strategic direction. 

“TNB’s credit strength reflects its monopoly on electricity transmission and distribution in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, its significant electricity generation capacity and strong operational track record with a generation capacity amounting to 13,158MW (54.1% of total installed capacity in Peninsular Malaysia) in 2018,” it said. 
 
TNB’s operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Opbitda) margin declined to 28.7% in 2018 (PE2017: 32.3%, FY2017: 32.6%) on the back of higher fuel costs and operating expenses.

 Against a backdrop of moderating revenue growth prospects and increasing operating expenses, the rating agency expects TNB to manage its operational costs more prudently going forward. 

“As more consumers manage their energy usage to incorporate energy efficiency targets, MARC believes electricity growth will remain tepid over the medium term. 

“The implementation of MFRS 16 beginning Jan 1, 2019 onwards may impact TNB’s profitability margins. MARC will continue to monitor the impact of MFRS 16 on TNB’s financials,” it said. 

Despite posting lower net profit of RM3.7bil, TNB group’s cash flow from operations (CFO) stood higher at RM14.4bil, while its CFO interest coverage and CFO debt coverage stood lower at 7.21 times and 0.22 times. 

TNB’s free cash flow stood at negative RM1.9bil, after the disbursement of capex amounting to RM11.8 bil. 

As at 2018, major generation projects comprised 30.5% of TNB’s capex while recurring capex formed the remaining 55.5%. 

As at end-2018, TNB’s total borrowings increased by 13% to RM52.4bil on the back of the RM3bil Sukuk Wakalah issuance in August 2018 and the US$750mil multi-currency sukuk issuance in November 2018.

“TNB’s standalone rating could come under pressure if its leverage-related metrics continue to weaken in 2019. 

“TNB’s contingent liabilities, which include liquidity support provided to its subsidiaries in the form of completion support and rolling guarantees on power plant projects, remain a potential concern, “ it said. 
 
MARC said the stable outlook reflects its expectation that government support will be sustained in the next 12 to 18 months in view of TNB’s strategic importance to the nation’s energy distribution. 

Any weakening in TNB’s debt protection measures and/or liquidity buffer would exert pressure on its standalone rating, it added."

to these industries. 

It said on Friday the the additional demands for cement and steel bars only amount to 1% to 2% of the current annual consumption of cement and steel bars locally.

“Also, given the government’s strong commitment to fiscal prudence, we are concerned that this could be a 'zero-sum game' as the revival of the still massive ECRL may deprive the government of its ability to implement other infrastructure projects over the next four to five years,” it said in its report.

The report was issued after the Prime Minister's Office announced the ECRL project would go ahead but the cost has been reduced significantly by RM21.50bil to RM44bil – this was a 32.8% reduction in the earlier cost of RM65.5bil.

Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd (MRL) and the China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC) had signed a supplementary agreement which would pave the way for the resumption of the ECRL.

The supplementary agreement, which covers the engineering, procurement, construction & Commissioning (EPCC) aspects of the ECRL, was achieved after months of negotiations between the companies involved as well as the Governments of Malaysia and the People's  Republic of China.

AmInvestment Research said the market had also very much priced in the news, given the strong run-up in share prices of construction stocks over the last one to two months. 

“Also after the run-up, valuations of construction stocks have become excessive with weight average FY19-20F price-to-earnings (P/Es) of 17.2 times and 16.3 times which are unjustified given the muted industry outlook.

“We maintain our underweight recommendation for the construction sector on the back of: (1) the continued cutback in public infrastructure spending as the government tightens its belt; (2) the prolonged downturn in the property market with oversupply in virtually all segments comprising residential, commercial, office and retail; and (3) the deterioration in cash flow along the entire value chain due to slow payment (or non-payment) by both public and private sector clients. Already, some of these receivables problems have escalated to defaults and contract disputes,” AmInvest Research said.

It also said that it was  uncertain at this point what will be the extent of the local participation in the project (or if there is any change from 30% previously). 

It also noted that due to the sharply reduced project cost, in order to minimise the loss of profits, it was doubtful that if the Chinese contractor would offer substantial sub-contracting works to local players, and in the event it is required to do so, if it will offer high-value jobs (such as tunnelling and construction of large bridges) to local players."

And according to some studies, the country will likely continue to be a net rice importer in the years to come.
The question is, does Malaysia’s inability to achieve 100% self-sufficiency level (SSL) in rice production by 2020 (as targeted just five years ago by the then Barisan Nasional-led government) signify a failure for the heavily subsidised industry?
According to Khazanah Research Institute (KRI), it does not.
“Statistical trends, geography and consumer preferences for premium rice means that Malaysia is likely to continue being a net importer,” the think tank explains.
“Considering this, the nation may be in a better position not to target 100% SSL, but with domestic rice produced sustainably, responsibly, safely and where farmers earn a sustainable income,” it adds.
In its recently published “The Status of the Paddy and Rice Industry in Malaysia” report, KRI finds that despite the significant public resources allocated to the industry, paddy farming is still perceived to be uneconomical.
In addition, paddy farmers are still associated with poverty; and Malaysia is still a net importer of rice with SSL hovering around 60%–70%.
It states that it is high time for the country to review its agricultural strategies, as the country has the potential to cultivate paddy responsibly, productively and still achieve better income for the farmers.
While it is unrealistic to expect Malaysia to be a net exporter of rice, KRI notes, it is sensible for the country to aim at achieving a balance of being a net importer, but with local farmers producing high quality grains and adhering to good agricultural practices."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/bank-executives-grapple-with-recession-talk/,Bank executives grapple with recession talk,Business News,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",,"NEW YORK: Executives at the largest US banks are grappling with how to best talk about the slowing economy and its impact on their businesses as they enter earnings season, people familiar with their thinking told Reuters.
Of particular concern is how to deal with the word “recession,” which has become all but verboten as US gross domestic product growth has decelerated.
Although many economists are predicting a downturn, a big bank executive doing so can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. On the other hand, a top banker dismissing recession worries to calm fears could be seen as uninformed or dishonest.
When asked to name the single biggest threat to the US economy at a congressional hearing on Tuesday, Citigroup Inc chief executive officer Michael Corbat answered, “Our ability to talk ourselves into the next recession.”
The “R word,” as some are calling it, has been a topic of discussion during earnings planning, executives, investor relations staff and public relations officials said.
There are a few well-tested strategies to reassure investors without misleading them, said Pen Pendleton, founding partner of financial communications firm CLP Strategies in New York, and a former spokesman for Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG.
If a bank is seeing negative signs in its loan book or markets businesses, executives should say something like “we believe we are competitively positioned in the market place to tackle the challenges,” Pendleton said.
An easy way to avoid endorsing any particular outlook is to defer to what in-house bank economists are predicting, he added.
“CEOs are always cautious about commenting on the economic outlook, especially when indicators are negative.” he said.
Even if executives feel obligated to share bad news because of a fiduciary duty to investors, they are likely to hedge what they say, according to an adviser of one of the top 20 banks by assets who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
For example, if loan performance suffered executives might speak optimistically about the future, or chalk it up to a “one-time thing” she said.
If top bankers do acknowledge a slowing US economy, they would not be alone.
The Federal Reserve took a sharply less aggressive posture last month when it signalled it would not hike rates this year and projected slower US growth for 2019.
While policymakers made clear they saw no recession in the next few years, some cautioned incoming data could change their minds on whether the next move should be to raise or lower rates, meeting minutes showed on Wednesday.
The US economy grew 2.9% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.6% the prior period and 4.2% in the middle of last year.
Wall Street CEOs and CFOs realise that their words carry a lot of weight, given they manage multi-trillion-dollar balance sheets and have insight into nearly every consumer and institutional lending business.
Bank stocks can be sensitive to any recession talk that makes headlines.
JPMorgan Chase & Co shares fell 1.7% when finance chief Marianne Lake said that “recessionary indicators ... are not flashing red, but they are off the floor” at the bank’s investor day in March.
Dimon then helped talk the shares back up, saying the bank’s decision not to raise its profitability target was not a warning about the economy and that JPMorgan was not predicting a recession, though it was nonetheless “prepared for one.”
“In a world of sound bites it’s difficult to be nuanced about recession risk,” said Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo. “It’s a fine line between alarming (markets) and conveying an impression of being recession-ready.”
The pressure to say the right thing can be intense enough to cause sleepless nights, executives and their counselors say.

We also gathered that the cement demand will only experience a mild recovery of a 1% improvement in demand in 2020 and subsequent recovery of 1.5% in 2021.”Separately, UOB Kay Hian said steel prices were up month-on-month in March.“According to the International Trade and Industry Ministry, local billets prices rose 2.9% month-on-month to RM2,050 per tonne and steel bar prices increased 2.5% month-on-month to RM2,195 per tonne in March.”The rise in local steel prices were in tandem with movements in China steel prices last month, said the research house.“We believe that the higher local and China steel prices were predominantly due to high raw material prices, particularly iron ore and international scrap prices.“As at April 4, 2019, iron ore prices jumped 8.5% month-on-month to US$93 (RM383) per tonne from US$86 (RM354) per tonne in March due to the Vale Dam disaster in Brazil which resulted in a shortage of iron ore although its contribution to global supply of iron ore was not significantly material.”Separately, UOB Kay Hian said cement average selling price had improved on higher fuel prices.“Based on our channel checks, bulk cement prices improved slightly in the first quarter of 2019 albeit still hovering below the RM200 per tonne level, which represents approximately 45% discount to its ceiling price.“We understand that the improvement in cement average selling price was largely to compensate for the electricity tariff hike in January,” said the research house."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/ltat-results-overstatedcompany-expects-its-fy18-results-to-be-profoundly-impacted/,LTAT results overstated,Corporate News,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The government has exposed yet another financial discrepancy by a government-linked investment company that took place under the previous Barisan Nasional administration, a few months after serious financial mismanagement practices were unearthed in the Muslim pilgrimage fund Lembaga Tabung Haji.
Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT), which manages the Armed Forces’ retirement fund, has been found to have overstated its net profit by a whopping 44% in financial year 2017 ended Dec 31 (FY17), following non-compliance of two previous transactions with the Financial Reporting Standards.
The financial discrepancy resulted in LTAT’s net profit being reported at RM662.2mil previously, compared to the actual amount of only RM370.7mil.
Given the re-adjustment to its accounts, the Armed Forces retirement fund has hinted that its FY18 financial results would be negatively impacted. 
However, it stopped short of saying whether LTAT would declare a lower dividend for FY18. 
The revelation was made by LTAT’s chief executive Nik Amlizan Mohamed yesterday.
This follows Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu’s statement earlier this week while campaigning for Pakatan Harapan in the Rantau by-election that LTAT’s FY17 audit report was manipulated.
He had later clarified that he actually meant the financial report of LTAT, and not the audit report.
In a statement issued yesterday, Nik Amlizan said the National Audit Department had issued a qualified opinion pertaining to Note 33 and 13 of LTAT’s FY17 financial statements.
As per the qualified opinion, Note 33 refers to the proceeds from land sales worth RM202.7mil, which should not have been taken into account in the FY17 financial statements.
“This transaction does not comply with the Financial Reporting Standards 118 relating to revenue, and does not comply with the materiality level against net profit, income and total asset and non-compliance to the clauses in the property sale and purchase agreement,” said Nik Amlizan.
Meanwhile, as for Note 13, it involves unrecognised impairments of RM88.9mil for two stocks held by LTAT. 
In its FY17 financial statement, LTAT only recognised a total impairment of RM18.46mil instead of RM107.36mil.
“The fair value of the two shares as at end-FY17 amounted to RM18.46mil compared with the purchase cost of RM107.36mil.
“Significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below cost is consideration to determine impairment for these two shares,” Nik Amlizan added.
Overall, with the re-adjustment of LTAT’s FY17 net profit to RM370.56mil, the fund’s retained earnings would drop drastically to a retained loss of RM31.6mil from a positive retained earnings of RM259.99mil previously.Nik Amlizan said that the release of LTAT’s FY18 accounts has been delayed, following the late submission of its FY17 accounts.
“LTAT is also of the view that with the finalised audited accounts of FY17 being in negative territory for its retained earnings, this will have a profound impact on its results for FY18.
“We are in the midst of finalising our accounts for FY18 and we expect to announce our results by July 2019,” she said.
LTAT underwent a major shake-up in its leadership after Pakatan Harapan became the ruling government following the 14th general election in 2018.
On Sept 7 last year, LTAT appointed Nik Amlizan as its new chief executive following the resignation of the long-serving Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin as the fund’s chief executive and board member.
In recent years, Lodin became one of the faces of the country’s biggest financial scandal as the chairman of the controversial 1Malaysia Development Bhd."

The ringgit has strengthened to around RM4.10 from RM4.18 against the US dollar,” he said.Yee was speaking at the market outlook seminar: What’s hot this year organised by Rakuten Trade on the island.“But more importantly, we expect the US economy to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates, which should react positively to the equity market by releasing more liquidity into the market.“If the US economy doesn’t improve over the next two to three quarters, we could even see another quantitative easing exercise,” he said.According to Yee, China is expected to be the saviour for drawing in foreign funds into the region.“China is in for a positive ride ahead with its Morgan Stanley Capital Index realignment, which will raise the rating of Chinese equities to 20% from 5% currently.“It is anticipated that this would draw US$80bil of foreign funds into the Chinese market.“Then, there’s the proposal to reduce the banks’ required ratio to boost economic activities.“For every 1% cut, an estimated US$120bil is expected to flow into the system. The move will generate spillover effects for the Asean markets,” Yee said.According to Yee, the banking and construction sectors will be the main beneficiaries.On the construction sector, Yee said there have been a lot of enquiries about construction stocks lately.“There has been more positive news on construction prospects in the country.“The total value of construction jobs yet to be implemented in the country is estimated to be RM307.5bil,” Yee said.Crest Builder Holdings Bhd , Econpile Holdings Bhd , MBSB Bank and Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd are the top stock picks of Rakuten Trade.Crest Builder has an outstanding construction order book of RM1.09bil, which will provide earnings visibility until 2022.“The next earnings driver for property development for Crest Builder is Latitud 8.

Anyone can come in and supply cement in Sarawak. But right now, we are the sole cement manufacturer,” he said.Lugun said that CMS’ cement-manufacturing plant could produce 2.75 million tonnes per year, and currently runs at a 60% capacity rate.“This would ensure a consistent supply of cement and sufficient capacity to meet the state’s growing demand from increasing construction activities,” he said.In financial year 2018, about 32% or RM534mil of CMS’ revenue came from its cement business, while construction and road maintenance contributed RM548mil.He pointed out that moving forward, revenue contribution for CMS would come from its investment in the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (Score), Sacofa and Kenanga Investment Bank.At Score, Lugun said CMS had a 25% stake in the OMS ferrosilicon and manganese smelter, as well as a 60% stake in the Malaysian Phosphate Additives’ plant, which is slated to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2020.In Sacofa, CMS owns a 50% stake.

After struggling for direction earlier in the session, all three major U.S. stock indexes had dipped into the red by midday.

Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, said investors are in wait-and-see mode.

""We've had this very large rally without much of a breather since Christmas,"" Nolte said. ""And now we're waiting for confirmation from the economic data or from earnings that the rally we've seen is justified.""

On the economic data side, initial jobless claims dropped last week to their lowest level since 1969, while in March, producer prices made their biggest gain since October, according to separate reports from the U.S. Labor Department.

The labor market's strength and the uptick in inflation could ease worries of a sharp global economic downturn reaching U.S. shores, a concern reflected in minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting released on Wednesday.

As reporting season gets underway, analysts expect S&P 500 first-quarter profits to have dropped 2.5% from a year ago, their first contraction since 2016.

Financial stocks were up 0.6% ahead of a string of earnings reports from six major U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co are due to report on Friday, followed by Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Inc on Monday and Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.29 points, or 0.28%, to 26,082.87, the S&P 500 lost 4.38 points, or 0.15%, to 2,883.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 23.34 points, or 0.29%, to 7,940.90.

Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven were trading lower.

Healthcare stocks were by far the biggest drag on the benchmark index, falling 1.6 a day after U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a ""Medicare for All"" plan to Congress , and the Senate Finance committee concluded a hearing to discuss the role pharmacy benefit managers play in drug pricing.

UnitedHealth Group Inc weighed heaviest on the Dow, dropping 4.8%.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/uber-unveils-ipo-with-warning-it-may-never-make-a-profit/,Uber unveils IPO with warning it may never make a profit,Corporate News,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",8:24 AM MYT,"NEW YORK: Uber Technologies Inc <IPO-UBER.N> has 91 million users, but growth is slowing and it may never make a profit, the ride-hailing company said on Thursday in its initial public offering filing.

The document gave the first comprehensive financial picture of the decade-old company which was started after its founders struggled to get a cab on a snowy night and has changed the way much of the world travels.

The S-1 filing underscores the rapid growth of Uber's business in the last three years but also how a string of public scandals and increased competition from rivals have weighed on its plans to attract and retain riders.

The disclosure also highlighted how far Uber remains from turning a profit, with the company cautioning it expects operating expenses to ""increase significantly in the foreseeable future"" and it ""may not achieve profitability."" Uber lost $3.03 billion in 2018 from operations.

The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed Uber had 91 million average monthly active users on its platforms, including for ride-hailing and Uber Eats, at the end of 2018. This is up 33.8 percent from 2017, but growth slowed from 51 percent a year earlier.

Uber had not disclosed the latest user numbers before, and the figure indicates the scale of the business. Although its user base includes customers of other services as well as ride-sharing, Uber's 91 million is nearly five times the 18.6 million announced by rival Lyft Inc.

Uber in 2018 had revenue of $11.3 billion, up around 42 percent over 2017, again below the 106 percent growth the prior year.

Uber set a placeholder amount of $1 billion but did not specify the size of the IPO. Reuters reported this week that Uber plans to sell around $10 billion worth of stock at a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. Investment bankers had previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion.

Uber would be the largest IPO since that of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014, which raised $25 billion.

Although Uber is no longer targeting a $120 billion valuation in the IPO, some stock bonuses to Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi and other company executives are only triggered when that valuation is reached.

ADVERSE EVENTS

Uber will follow Lyft in going public. Shares in its smaller rival closed at $61.01 on Thursday, 15 percent below its IPO price set late last month, a development which has sent chilling signal for other tech start-ups looking to go public.

After making the public filing, Uber will begin a series of investor presentations, called a roadshow, which Reuters has reported will start the week of April 29. The company is on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May.

Uber faces questions over how it will navigate any transition towards self-driving vehicles, a technology seen as potentially dramatically lowering costs but which could also disrupt its business model.

One advantage Uber will likely seek to play up to investors is that it is the largest player in many of the markets in which it operates. Analysts consider building scale crucial for Uber's business model to become profitable.

In addition to answering questions about the company's finances, Uber CEO Khosrowshahi will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.

Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 from Expedia Inc to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO.

Uber said in its filing its ridehailing position in the United States and Canada was ""significantly impacted by adverse publicity events"" and that its position in many markets has been threatened by discounts from other ride-hailing companies.

A #DeleteUber campaign surged on social media in 2017 after a public relations crisis, which Uber said in its filing meant hundreds of thousands of consumers stopped using its platform within days.

Uber said its market share fell in most regions last year, although the rate of decline has slowed. The company claims more than 65 percent market share in the United States and Canada, compared to Lyft's stated 39 percent in the United States.

Uber is reserving some shares in the IPO for drivers who have completed 2,500 trips among other criteria. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/imf-chief-says-brexit-delay-averts-terrible-outcome/,IMF chief says Brexit delay averts terrible outcome,Economy,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",8:29 AM MYT,"WASHINGTON: The six-month delay of Britain's exit from the European Union avoids the ""terrible outcome"" of a ""no-deal"" Brexit that would further pressure a slowing global economy but does nothing to lift uncertainty over the final outcome, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday.

Moreover, the just-struck arrangement would not resolve the issues between Britain and the EU, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said at a news conference during the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington.

Earlier on Thursday, EU leaders gave Britain another six months to sort out its departure from the 28-member bloc, but the reprieve offered no clarity on when, how, or even if Brexit will happen.

""At least the UK is not leaving on April 12 without a deal. It gives time for continued discussions between the various parties involved in the UK. It probably gives time for economic agents to better prepare for all options, particularly industrialists and workers, in order to try to secure their future,"" Lagarde said.

""A no-deal Brexit would have been a terrible outcome.""

While knock-on effects of the Brexit saga are rippling around the world to one extent or another, the three years since the June 2016 referendum to leave the EU have weighed most heavily on Britain.

The uncertainty facing British businesses has gone ""through the roof"" due to Brexit, hurting investment and posing long-term challenges for economic productivity, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said at an event on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings.

Despite an ""incredibly tight"" labor market, businesses have held off on investment since the referendum, he said.

Carney said that while the risk of a no-deal Brexit had been lowered, it remained to be seen how well the extra time is used.

""It provides a window of time for a political process, particularly in the UK, to forge a consensus within the House of Commons around the form of agreement. We will see how that time is used,"" Carney said.

RISKS BEYOND BREXIT

Brexit is just one of a clutch of economic risks that prompted the IMF this week to cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3 percent, the lowest rate since 2016, with a slight rebound to 3.6 percent expected next year.

The IMF's No. 2 official, David Lipton, said the institution was not projecting a global recession but the growth slowdown leaves the world in a delicate spot.

""We do have to worry about the possibility of recession,"" he said during a discussion at the IMF.

Officials have repeatedly pointed to fraught trade relations as a major culprit behind the global slowdown.

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he remained hopeful Japan's export-reliant economy will soon emerge from a soft patch but added that ongoing U.S.-China trade talks loomed over the global outlook.

""Protectionism benefits neither the United States nor China,"" Kuroda told reporters upon arriving for a meeting of Group of 20 finance leaders.

Trade tensions are the top concern among emerging market finance officials as well. In a communique from a meeting of the so-called Group of 24 developing market nations released on Thursday, officials said: ""International trade has delivered enormous benefits globally and has been an important engine of growth among G24 countries.""

The group said it stood ready to cooperate in the effort to build ""a modern, open, rules-based, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system.""

Weakness in global trade is making economies rely more on consumers, BoE's Carney said. ""Normally when expansions are reliant on the consumer, you start watching the clock, in terms of how much longer it will last.""

German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the most important task for leaders was to eliminate the political risks hindering growth.

""It's our job to create an environment of certainty so that companies and consumers can make investments,"" Scholz told reporters during a stop in Iceland on the way to Washington.

VENEZUELA QUESTION

Lagarde also said IMF shareholders were still undecided on whether to recognize Venezuelan opposition chief Juan Guaido as the South American country's leader, a step seen as required for the IMF and World Bank to provide aid.

President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government has not requested any aid and Venezuela, which is mired in a deep economic crisis marked by widespread shortages of food and medicine, has shunned the IMF since 2004.

But the IMF is prepared to move quickly on a package once a decision on the leadership question has been made, Lagarde said. Her comments were echoed by David Malpass, the new president of the World Bank. - Reuters"

Economists polled by Reuters forecast Australia's A$1.9 trillion ($1.4 trillion) annual gross domestic product (GDP) would expand 2.2 percent in 2019, down from a prediction of 2.7 percent in the previous poll.

Growth was seen picking up to 2.6 percent in 2020, though that would still be short of the 2.75 percent rate considered trend.

""Housing and the consumer remain at the epicentre of the domestic slowdown. Developments on both fronts continue to point to the 2018 drag carrying into 2019,"" said Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan.

""We expect growth to remain at a subdued 2.2 percent pace throughout 2019 and 2020.""

The slowdown has fuelled speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would have to cut interest rates from already record lows to shore up activity.

Just this week, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle acknowledged economic output had disappointed but argued the continued strength of employment might presage an upturn.

Australia's conservative government has also chipped in some fiscal stimulus for the second half of this year with a budget full of tax breaks and infrastructure spending.

The government faces an election on May 18 and is trailing badly in opinion polls.

""A disposable income boost would alleviate some of the strains on household budgets and reduce the downside risks to consumer spending,"" said CBA chief economist Michael Blythe.

He estimated planned tax cuts would have the same economic impact as two quarter-point cuts in interest rates.

""The lift in transport infrastructure spending will help support demand in the short term, and lift incomes and productivity over the longer haul,"" he added.

There is plenty of scope for stimulus as inflation remains well-contained, having run below the RBA's 2-3 percent target band for two whole years.

The latest poll showed analysts expected inflation of just 1.9 percent for this year, rising marginally to 2.2 percent in 2020. - Reuters"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/12/disneyplus-undercuts-netflix-with-us$7-price-launching-costly-battle/,"Disney+ undercuts Netflix with US$7 price, launching costly battle",Corporate News,"Friday, 12 Apr 2019",10:25 AM MYT,"LOS ANGELES: Walt Disney Co.’s new streaming service will cost $7 a month when it debuts Nov. 12, a gambit that the entertainment giant can undercut Netflix Inc. in an increasingly crowded field.

The company unveiled the service Thursday on a sound stage used to make the original “Mary Poppins,” delivering an Apple-style presentation of the online product. The platform will be several dollars less than Netflix’s most popular plan, which runs $11, and it will weigh heavily on Disney’s finances. Disney+ isn’t expected to break even for about five years.

Beyond the price and technology, the service will live or die based on its content -- and that’s where Disney made a big statement. Disney+ will feature an arsenal of kid-friendly programming, including 13 classic animated movies, 21 Pixar features, original series, and material from its Marvel and Star Wars franchises.

“We are confident this is a product people are going to sign up in droves to have,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Emily Chang.

Disney+ will begin rolling out to the U.S., Western Europe and Asia in the first fiscal quarter, near the end of the calendar year. It will then arrive in Eastern Europe and Latin America a year later.

'Welcome Synergy’

Disney plans to spend $1 billion on streaming programming in the next year, and it doesn’t expect to make a profit until fiscal 2024, when the platform could have 60 million to 90 million customers. Two-thirds of those subscribers will be overseas, the company predicted.

Disney+ also will include “The Simpsons,” a show acquired in Disney’s purchase of 21st Century Fox Inc. entertainment assets last month. Borrowing the show’s cheeky tone, Disney showed a clip of the Simpsons family with a statue of Darth Vader on one side and Iger on a pedestal nearby. A signed photo of Rupert Murdoch -- the billionaire mogul behind Fox -- was in the trash. There was a “Welcome Synergy” sign above.

“I salute our new corporate overlord,” Bart Simpson told his family, while holding Disney mouse ears. “Put on those ears.”

Disney’s newest theatrical films will head to the new streaming platform after their runs in movie theaters and home video. That includes “Captain Marvel” and the upcoming “Avengers: Endgame,” “Aladdin” and “Toy Story 4.”

The company previously had deals with Netflix and others to offer its content, but Disney gave up those partnerships -- and the revenue -- to make its own service more desirable.

Iger’s Finale

For Iger, Disney+ is a bit of a swan song. The company’s longtime steward reiterated Thursday that he expects to step down as CEO at the end of 2021, when his contract expires.

During the presentation to investors, Disney gave a peek at how the service will work. It features five tiles devoted to key Disney brands, including Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. 

The 4K-resolution content will be available on internet-connected TVs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.

The look and feel of Disney+ isn’t radically different from Netflix’s design. But Disney is betting that its devoted fan base will find reason to add another streaming service.

DC Edge

At $6.99, Disney+ also is beating a comic-book rival: AT&T Inc.’s DC Comics introduced a service at $7.99 a month that includes material from characters like Wonder Woman, Batman and Superman characters.

The new product isn’t Disney’s only streaming platform. It acquired majority-control of the Hulu TV service with the $71 billion Fox deal, and it’s now considering whether to expand that product overseas.

A Hulu price cut, which lowered its entry-level, ad-supported version by 25 percent to $6 a month, helped bring a surge of customers, Disney said. Hulu expects to double its ad revenue over the next few years.

“Hulu is doing just great,” said Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international operations. “We are really pleased.”

ESPN+ Expansion

Disney also has the ESPN+ online sports service, which will get a Latin American launch, the company said. As it expands, that product will have losses of $650 million in the next two years.

“You can figure that we will bundle ESPN+ and Disney+ fairly soon,’’ Iger said.
With Disney+, the company learned lessons from its U.K. launch of DisneyLife, which featured online access to albums, games and publications.

“The consumer was mostly interested in movies and TV,” Iger said. “No other types of media.”

Netflix, meanwhile, may face more pressure to justify it higher price. But the company has managed to raise rates in markets all over the world during the past few years, without much consequence.

Its latest U.S. price hike, announced in January, increased the cost of Netflix’s most popular plan by 10 percent to $11. Given Netflix’s grip on households, especially in the U.S., analysts expect customers to take the increase in stride. - Bloomberg"

After tightening policy twice last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore -- which uses the exchange rate as its main policy tool -- left the slope and width of the currency band unchanged, as well as the level at which it is centered. 

The stance is “consistent with a modest and gradual appreciation path” of the currency band, it said in a statement on its website.

Twenty of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the move, with just two predicting a tightening.

“Growth in the Singapore economy has eased, bringing the level of output closer to its underlying potential,” the MAS said. “Despite some pickup in labor costs, inflationary pressures are mild and should remain contained.”

The Singapore dollar weakened after the decision, dropping as much as 0.1 percent to S$1.3580 against the U.S. currency. It was unchanged at S$1.3562 as of 9:56 a.m. on Friday.

“The growth and inflation rhetoric has come off quite a fair bit,” said Selena Ling, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. After last year’s tightening “they’re in pause mode” now, she said.

Global Policy

Central banks globally have taken an abrupt turn toward more dovish policy in 2019, led by a change in tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve. World growth forecasts have been repeatedly downgraded, including by the International Monetary Fund this week, as U.S.-China trade tensions remain heightened and as Chinese demand ebbs.

The government is projecting growth in the export-reliant economy will slow to just below the midpoint of the 1.5 to 3.5 percent range after a 3.2 percent pace in 2018. A separate report Friday showed gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, lower than economists had projected.

The MAS sees growth at “slightly below potential this year, following two years when it was above trend.” That implies a softer inflation picture as well, allowing policy makers to stay on hold.

Even so, Singapore officials see domestic and regional growth remaining resilient despite mounting global risks. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg last week that Southeast Asia economies “continue to grow quite well even this year and next.” 

The central bank lowered its core inflation forecast range for this year to 1 percent to 2 percent from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent previously, mainly because of a drop in electricity costs. In February, the central bank lowered its headline inflation projection to 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.- Bloomberg"

Regional Corridor Development Authority (Recoda) CEO Datuk Ismawi Ismuni said there were 22 projects by the private sector in Score, of which mainly from energy-intensive and heavy industries.

“Press Metal alone consume 1,200 MW of power from the Samalaju power plant.

“Moving forward, we will be focusing on getting investment from downstream sector which is not power intensive,” he told reporters at a press conference after the Bursa Malaysia-Hong Leong Investment Bank Stratum Series on “Sarawak: Journey in Transformation”.

It is worth noting that Press Metal, an aluminium smelting company, was one of the pioneers at Score, having enjoyed lower electricity tariff with a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Sarawak.

Ismawi said that the energy-intensive sector would act as a trigger to create value-added services at Score.

“Of course we realise that there would be concerns on the supply of electricity. Hence, we would work on getting investments in the downstream sector,” he said.

He pointed out that there is a major hydro plant being built in Baleh that will have the capacity to generate 1,285MW and expected to complete in 2025.

“We are also adding another turbine in Bakun hydro-dam that would increase the capacity to 2,700 MW from 2,400MW,” Ismawi said.

The pipeline for initial public offerings is “robust” and stretches across several industries, said Dorothee Blessing, vice chairman of investment banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JPMorgan Chase & Co. 

That’s after the value of IPOs in Germany quadrupled to 11.3 billion euros ($12.7 billion) last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“Now we will have to see if there are appropriate windows in the market to implement these plans,” said Blessing, who also runs the bank’s German business.

Blessing attributes the lack of share sales in Germany and the rest of the world to market fluctuations at the end of 2018. This year, JPMorgan expects more technology companies to stage IPOs and more businesses controlled by private-equity firms to seek listings.

Volkswagen AG last month canceled a stock sale for its Traton SE division, which could have been Europe’s biggest IPO of this year. The carmaker cited weak market conditions. 

So far, no German companies have gained a listing in 2019, according to the data, as Europe’s IPO market had the slowest start to a year since the financial crisis, even though it recently showed some signs of life.

Blessing also expects fewer large mergers and acquisitions in the country in 2019, compared to last year. 

“One must not forget that many German companies have been very active in recent years, and the deals of the past years must be digested,” she said.

One industry that could see more activity is banking. Deutsche Bank AG is in talks to merge with Commerzbank AG, and Blessing says that deal-making in the industry could gain momentum.

“We expect to see more banking consolidation across European borders over the next few years. It’s not just about economies of scale, but also business models,” she said.

Preparing for Brexit
Brexit has prompted a number of lenders to relocate London-based employees to continental European cities. As many as 5,000 jobs could be added in the coming 12 to 18 months in Frankfurt as a result of this, according to the association representing foreign banks in Germany. 

For its part, JPMorgan is geared up to add its workforce in the city if need be.

“We had no choice but to prepare for a possible hard-Brexit scenario,” Blessing said. “Here in Frankfurt, we are well prepared and have secured additional office capacity in connection with Brexit.”

Even without Brexit, Germany has always played an important role beyond M&A for JPMorgan Chase, Blessing said, citing the company’s markets divisions and global corporate banking business.

It’s not just about multinational corporations, she added. “Medium-sized businesses make up a significant proportion of our customers here in Germany, and many are global leaders in their industries.” - Bloomberg"

Lugun said that CMSB’s cement manufacturing plant could produce 2.75 million metric tonnes per year, and it currently runs at 60% of capacity.

“This would ensure a consistent supply of cement and ensuring sufficient capacity to meet the state’s growing demand from increasing construction activities,” he said.

In FY18, about 32% or RM534mil to CSMB’s revenue came from its cement business.

At Score, Lugun said CMSB has a 25% stake in OMS ferrosilicon and manganese smelter as well as 60% stake in Malaysian Phosphate Additive (MPA) plant, which is slated to commence operation in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Lyft’s IPO priced at the top end of its upwardly revised range last month, assigning it a valuation of more than $24 billion in an offering that raised $2.34 billion. 

But the stock has languished since debuting on the Nasdaq on March 29, as concerns about the startup’s potential for profitability have become more prominent.

Lyft shares ended on Wednesday down 11 percent at $60.12, well below their $72 IPO price. Lyft was the first in a string of technology IPOs expected this year, including food delivery service Postmates and smart exercise bike Peleton.
Lyft’s poor stock performance bodes ill for these IPOs, especially for companies like Uber with no profits to show.

“There’s no discernable way these companies are valued. What you’re really buying into is the long-term ability of the company to capture lots of sales and hopefully get profitable at some point,” said Brian Hamilton, founder of data firm Sageworks.

“I’m sure that the Lyft debut is going to affect both Uber and Pinterest,” Hamilton added.

Uber filed for its IPO in December with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the same week as Lyft. But it let Lyft go first with its offering, partly because it was working on a new private fundraising round for its autonomous driving unit.

Uber is now paying the price of going second. It is planning to seek a valuation between $90 billion and $100 billion, short of the $120 billion investment bankers previously told the company it could be worth in an IPO, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Image sharing app Pinterest Inc this week also set the terms for its IPO which would value the company at up to $11.3 billion, below its latest fundraising round which valued it at $12 billion in 2017. 
Prior to Lyft going public, Pinterest had been weighing a valuation at or near the last fundraising round, according to a source familiar with the matter. 

Pinterest declined to comment.

Uber is expected to make its detailed financial results public on Thursday. It lost $3.3 billion last year, excluding one-off gains, while Lyft lost $911 million for 2018. Pinterest also lost $62.97 million in 2018. Uber declined to comment.

GETTING GREEDY

Investors and analysts said technology unicorn IPOs are losing their luster, not just because more investors are asking tough questions about their prospects, but because the startups overestimated pent-up demand for their offerings.

“Lyft wanted to be first... and it got to a point where they got so aggressive with their pricing and they got kind of greedy,” said Catherine McCarthy, an Allianz Global Investors research analyst.

The pressure to become profitable will ratchet up once these companies become public, said Jordan Stuart, a portfolio manager for Federated Kaufmann funds who often purchases companies’ stock in the IPO.

“The pace of change is happening so quickly that you have to show that you can become profitable quickly,” Stuart said.

“Some of these companies could go away tomorrow because it’s just an app on my phone and I can find another one in a second to get to work or have food delivered.” - Reuters"

The founder of Singapore-based water and power company Hyflux Ltd., which could see its court protection from creditors expire at the end of the month, has had a torrid two weeks. 

A white-knight takeover that might have kept the company together has collapsed, hundreds of angry creditors protested in public, and the government appears set to step in and take over part of the company’s biggest asset for nothing.

How Lum, who earned a string of international accolades as one of the world’s most lauded female entrepreneurs, came to this point has raised questions about the culture of investment in Singapore and rattled the island’s reputation for the checks and balances on how its companies are run.

“As the major shareholder, chairman and CEO, she clearly bears much of the responsibility,’’ said Mak Yuen Teen, associate professor at National University of Singapore Business School, who specializes in corporate governance. “However, the board is also collectively responsible as it is supposed to provide oversight.’’

Saddled with S$2.8 billion ($2.1 billion) of unsecured claims and default notices, Hyflux is teetering on the brink of insolvency, leaving thousands of bondholders who stand to lose their money wondering how such a highly respected company could collapse so fast.

At the center of that question is Lum, 58, an orphan who went from abject poverty to build one of Singapore’s most successful home-grown brands. 

In the process she garnered the praise of Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong when he opened the nation’s biggest desalination plant in 2013, and made a personal fortune currently valued at $200 million, according to Bloomberg estimates.

“She was like an Elon Musk of Singapore,” said Ray Ho, 65, a retiree who bought Hyflux bonds and joined a public protest with hundreds of other small investors on March 30 in Singapore’s central business district. “You have not-so-sophisticated investors who buy into a leap of faith because they buy into Olivia Lum.”

Lum’s schedule is now extremely packed and she’s unable to comment for this story, a Hyflux spokesperson said in an email.

Olivia Lum Ooi Lin’s rags-to-riches story has been told many times. Abandoned at birth in the district hospital of Kampar, a small town in Perak state in Malaysia, she was adopted by a widow whom she called “grandmother,” according to her biography in Singapore’s National Library.

Her foster mother was kind to her, but was a compulsive gambler, playing mahjong for hours on end. As she lost money, the family had to quit their terraced house and garden for a hut with a metal roof and bare-earth floor.

The young Lum earned money by weaving baskets, playing the clarinet in funeral processions and selling sandwiches and food to classmates at school, where she proved to be a talented student.

At 16, on the advice of her teacher, she moved to Singapore to get a better education, bunking with migrant workers from her hometown. Good grades got her a place at a top senior high school and she paid for her accommodation and studies by tutoring other students and working as a promoter in department stores.

She spent her weekends driving to hospitals in Malaysia on her 150cc Suzuki motorbike to visit her sick foster mother, who died while Lum was taking her final exams.

Starting Business

Despite her grief, Lum won a place to major in chemistry at the National University of Singapore and went on to join Glaxo Pharmaceuticals as a chemist, where she learned about water treatment. 

Her salary allowed her to buy an apartment, which she sold three years later, raising S$20,000 to start her own company, Hydrochem, according to Hyflux’s website.

With two other staff, Lum knocked on doors of factories in Singapore and Malaysia to sell third-party water-treatment equipment. The company expanded into China and by 1999 had developed its own technology using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membranes.

Lum had to persuade corporations that her unknown Singapore brand could compete with big established names. One of her first customers was Singapore’s bird park, which had just acquired “some very, very expensive Emperor penguins,’’ Lum told students at Yale-NUS college in Singapore in 2015.

Penguin Test

She said the head of the park asked her “Will you kill my penguins?’’

“I said I’ll drink first,’’ Lum recalled. “When he saw I was still surviving, he believed that perhaps this water could be for the penguins.’’

The new technology was the breakthrough that would transform the company’s fortunes, allowing it to bring proprietary technology to a market that was under increasing pressure to meet stricter environmental standards in Asia and gain new fresh water supplies in the Middle East.

“Everything comes from membrane technology,’’ Lum told Bloomberg TV in a 2005 interview. “We use membrane to treat wastewater; we use membrane to desalinate seawater; and we use membrane to purify water from the air.’’

In 2001, the re-branded Hyflux Ltd. held its first public share offering, raising S$6.8 million. Within three weeks of the start of trading, shareholders had doubled their money. The same year, Hyflux won its first contract for a municipal water treatment plant in Singapore.

High-Flier

By now Lum was a high-flier, lauded by politicians, business groups and the media as a model female entrepreneur. She became a nominated member of parliament in Singapore, one of a handful of lawmakers appointed by the President. At its peak, her net worth was about $500 million, according to Bloomberg calculations.

While Lum’s early days were spent selling to clients, she remained a scientist at heart. In a 2002 interview with local magazine Her World, which named Lum Woman of the Year, she said the only department she micromanaged was R&D, which still reported directly to her.

The poor orphan had achieved all the trappings of wealth “a Mercedes-Benz, Gucci bag, Prada pumps. She lived in a house with a maid, two dogs, two parrots and a rabbit, according to the magazine interview.

But she continued to clock 16-hour workdays, starting at 10 a.m. and holding management meetings at 8 p.m.

And the company continued to prosper.

By early 2011, it had a market value of more than $1.6 billion. That year, Lum flew to Monte Carlo to be the first woman presented with Ernst & Young’s World Entrepreneur of the Year award. It was also the year Hyflux won its biggest project: the Tuaspring combined desalination and power plant.

By the time the facility opened in 2013, Hyflux’s expansion was in full spate, especially in the Middle East. The following year, the company announced agreements to build facilities in Oman and Saudi Arabia.

Then oil prices collapsed. In less than seven months, crude fell 60 percent and Middle Eastern states began to stall or cancel infrastructure projects. For some companies doing business in the region, payments were often delayed and new contracts dried up.

Debt Pile

Lum’s risk-taking approach and determination to expand the business had resulted in massive borrowing. To fund Tuaspring, Hyflux raised more than S$1.4 billion in bank loans, perpetual bonds and an issue of preferred shares.

“While she is undoubtedly a brilliant entrepreneur, she failed to recognize the need to hire a strong CEO” and a strong and independent board, said Mak at NUS Business School. “These contributed to the company growing too fast in diverse markets, taking on too much debt and without proper risk management.’’

Just as a drop in oil prices affected the construction industry in the Middle East, it was a slump in power prices in Singapore as the government deregulated supply that proved the Achilles heel for Hyflux. 

The Tuaspring project was conceived with the idea that the plant would earn revenue by selling excess power to the nation’s electricity grid. But as power prices fell, the plant began to lose money.

“Olivia Lum could have been more prudent as a manager in particular with Hyflux’s decision to bid for Tuaspring,” said Simon Jong, head of fixed-income research at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “It might have been better to have been more conservative when bidding for the project, to allow for buffers for execution risk and market weakness.”

Big Losses
Among those who helped fund the plant were some 34,000 individual investors who now stand to lose almost everything. Lured by the promise of a 6 percent annual return forever from a company that was run by one of the nation’s corporate superstars, many invested their retirement savings.

Lum remains positive and is holding up well, according to two people close to her, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. One of them said she feels bad about what happened to the individual investors and wants to do something to help them.

On Feb. 16, she offered her stake of 267 million shares and securities as part of SM Investments’ proposed restructuring plan. With the collapse of the deal, Lum is trying to see what else she can do, one of the people said.

“She’s a fighter, she’ll fight for what she believes in and do whatever she can to turn this around,” said Elim Chew, a fellow Singaporean entrepreneur who knows Lum. “It’s just sad it’s her because it’s so close to home. When you’re up there, everyone’s your friend. When you’re going down, only a few true friends will be there.”

Options Dwindling

Lum is running out of options to turn it around. Hyflux has said it is working with key creditor groups and relevant stakeholders to find a way to pursue alternatives after the SM bid failed. But with the court protection deadline looming, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. credit research suggested that the likelihood of liquidation had increased.

While that may do little to ease the pain of the investors, Lum herself cashed in part of her stake back in 2005, when the stock was near its peak.

Property records show her real estate holdings include a two-storEy house with swimming pool and underground parking that she built on a 2,107 square meter plot on Dalvey Road, in one of the city’s richest neighborhoods.

While Lum remains financially well off, the empire she spent a lifetime building is coming undone. The company’s dramatic rise and fall has prompted questions about Singapore’s business culture and the readiness of individual investors to back projects that seem to have the seal of government approval, often without understanding the risks. 

In a note on April 8, S&P Global Ratings warned that more defaults could occur in Singapore.

“Corporate governance in Singapore is not as good as we would like to believe,’’ said Mak at NUS. “Other companies dominated by founders who are unwilling to let go and bring in the right people may go the same way.’’ - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/iata-urges-the-government-to-reconsider-air-passenger-departure-levy/,IATA urges the Government to reconsider air passenger departure levy,Corporate News,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",5:08 PM MYT,"PETALING JAYA: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed disappointment with the passing of the Departure Levy Bill by Dewan Rakyat, and is urging for its implementation to be reconsidered.

In a statement Thursday, IATA’s regional vice president for Asia-Pacific Conrad Clifford said the air passenger departure levy has the potential to do more harm than good to the Malaysian economy. 

“While the intention is to raise revenue for the government in the short run, it needs to be recognized that aviation is a catalyst for economic growth, and any action that dampens the demand for travel will also hurt the industry’s economic contributions to the country,” Clifford said.

In 2017, Malaysia’s aviation sector supported a total of 450,000 jobs and contributed a total of US$10.1bil to Malaysia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The broader tourism sector accounted for 13.4% of total Malaysian GDP, which is significantly supported by air transport.

Based on IATA’s analysis, the introduction of the levy would reduce the number of passengers departing Malaysia by air by up to 835,000 per year, decrease the aviation sector’s GDP contribution by up to US$419mil and see a reduction of up to 5,300 jobs.

IATA said the imposition of the levy would also erode Malaysia’s competitiveness as a tourist destination in the region to the detriment of its economy.

The levy also contradicts accepted policies on taxation published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 

“As an ICAO Council member, Malaysia should demonstrate leadership in adhering to ICAO’s policies,” said Clifford.

“We strongly urge the Malaysian government to reconsider the levy and abandon the plans to introduce it.”"

The slide in the power giant's share price weighed heavily on the already cautious stock market where the FBM KLCI closed down 15.23 points or 0.93% to 1,624.23. 

The KLCI closed at the lowest since December 2016 with only one out of the 30 stocks in the index in the positive zone. Turnover was 3.58 billion shares valued at RM2.27bil. 

The broader market was weaker as losers beat gainers more than two to one or 620 decliners to 275 advancers and 390 counters unchanged.

StarBiz Online reported the 85 million Tenaga shares were transacted at RM12.33 each or 25 sen below Wednesday's close.

The 85 million shares represented a 1.49% stake based on Tenaga's share base of 5.686 billion units. At the close, Tenaga was down 52 sen to RM12.06. 

Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy at  SPI Asset Management said foreign investors were continuing to withdraw funds from the local stock market, and this was hurting the ringgit. 

“I remain bullish in the ringgit even more as China data has started to turn positive and oil prices are rocketing higher. But perhaps traders are waiting for further confirmation from this week China data blitz,” he said.

As for the KLCI, Innes said however, the index could be suffering from the China MSCI rebalancing vacuum effect as investor flock to China A-shares anticipating more explosive returns as mainland's inflows are expected to accelerate over the next three to five months. 

Market sentiment was also impacted by the weaker-than-expected industrial production index.  Malaysia's industrial production index (IPI) increased at a slower pace of 1.7% in February compared with a Bloomberg survey of a 2.2% increase due to a decline in the mining output.

Malaysia Airports also came under selling pressure, extending the decline over the week on concerns about the impact from the passenger departure levy. It fell 14 sen to RM6.61.

Bloomberg reported the International Air Transport Association was disappointed with the proposed response to the passing of departure levy bill by parliament.

“Levy would reduce number of passengers departing Malaysia by up to 835,000 a year. Aviation sector’s GDP contribution would be lowered by up to US$419mil and lead to loss of up to 5,300 jobs. The levy would erode Malaysia’s competitiveness as tourist destination,” IATA was reported saying. 

Among the telcos, Maxis fell 10 sen to RM5.50, Axiata six sen to RM4.09 while Digi was unchaged at RMRM4.69.

Sime Plantation lost nine sen to RM5.05, IOI Corp four seb to RM4.48, PPB Group 12 sen to RM18.68 and KL Kepong unchanged at RM24.90.

IHH fell five sen to RM5.55, Genting Bhd  11 sen to RM6.68, GentingM five sen to RM3.13. Sime Darby was the only gainer among the 30 stocks, ekeing out a one sen gain to RM2.20.

Petronas Chemical fell four sen to RM8.96, Dialog five sen to RM3.19, Petronas Dagangan two sen lower at RM24.98 and Petronas Gas flat at RM17.623.

The country's largest bank by assets had disbursed RM12.2bil housing loans last year, which is part of its total disbursed mortgages of RM87.5bil as at Dec 31, 2018.

Group president and CEO Datuk Abdul Farid Alias said on Thursday that amount is part of the bank’s total loans of RM500bil globally.

“There was a question may be out of curiosity, maybe unsure of banks and how banks perform at this day and age.

“So, there was a statement with respect to whether we are supporting the economy. We just want to prove that point,” he told a press conference after the AGM here.

Farid added the approval rate for eligible applicants was 80% as at March 31 as compared to the industry average of 70%.

The total book for SMEs is about RM41.1bil, comprising RM24bil for business banking and RM17.1bil for retail SMEs.
Farid also said that to support Maybank’s continued growth, five priority areas have been identified for this year namely, driving income growth, ensuring better productivity, managing asset quality, sound liquidity & capital management as well as digitalisation.

“We will look to expand revenue streams through business collaborations as well as expand our balance sheet in a measured manner in line with economic growths in our respective markets as well as our conservative risk posture,” he explained. “Protecting our margins via selective asset growth will be a key focus in this regard.” 

The group, he said, will also drive positive JAWs across all business segments to achieve a cost-to-income ratio of around 47%, while emphasising on up-skilling employees for the digital economy.

At the same time, he added Maybank will maintain its robust risk management practices as well as on-going recovery efforts to ensure that asset quality remain sound. 

“Liquidity is another key area that we will emphasise as it provides us a solid foundation to withstand external headwinds. In line with this, we will prioritise maintaining stable liquidity risk indicators, especially in view of the impending NSFR adoption effective 2020,” he explained. 

“Added to this will be ensuring a robust capital position – something that we have already been doing well over the years, and which has placed us among the best capitalised banks in the region.” 

On digitalisation, Farid said the group will maintain a conservative yet impactful investment spend to effectively deliver improved customer experience through the roll-out of new digital products and services. 

“This will be complemented by concerted efforts across all levels within Maybank to enhance the use of data driven analytics so that we can understand customers’ behaviour and needs better to effectively serve them as their Digital Bank of Choice.”

“In fact, with the advancement in data analytics and science, not only can we create models to serve our customers better, but also improve our risk modelling capabilities,” he explained. 

“Ultimately they can help us determine the group’s optimal balance sheet structure, identify the right pricing of our assets and liabilities to maximise risk returns whilst ensuring effective liquidity utilisation.”

Meanwhile, Maybank chairman Datuk Mohaiyani Shamsudin said the group will ensure that it continues to create sustainable value for its stakeholders in a rapidly changing operating landscape.

The board’s main priority will be to drive a business strategy that will enable long-term value creation for all stakeholders, she said. 

“While we achieved a record FY2018 with a 7.9% increase in net profit to RM8.11bil, our aim is to ensure that we remain well equipped to withstand any economic headwinds that may arise in the coming year,” she said.

“Hence, in addition to focusing on business and operational efficiency as a foundation, we want to drive Maybank’s sustainability agenda by enhancing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations within the group,” she said.

""These include integrating ESG considerations into our core businesses by focusing on impact based solutions as well as empowering communities across the region where the group is present.” 

Mohaiyani said other aspects that the group will look into will be to strengthen and institutionalise the compliance culture across its entire operations as well as ensure robust succession planning to prepare for its long-term requirements."

FGV’s shares gained three sen to close at RM1.30 on Wednesday after the Felda White Paper was released to the public.
But investors took the opportunity to profit-take yesterday after Economic Affairs Minister, Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, said in Parliament that Felda was in discussions with the FGV management to revisit the terms of the LLA for a fairer deal.
Azmin had reportedly said that Felda should receive an annual payment of RM248mil plus a 15% share of plantation profits generated from the 99-year lease of its commercial land.
However, Felda reportedly only receives about RM400mil a year from FGV, compared to the minimum requirement of RM800mil a year. The LLA is a 99-year agreement between Felda and FGV. 
AllianceDBS Research in a report yesterday said that it did not think that the agreement would be revised at the expense of FGV. 
“Any deal that would result in higher payments from FGV would unlikely be agreed upon by the shareholders of FGV. Felda would have to pay FGV compensation in accordance with the LLA’s terms and conditions if it intends to amend/terminate the agreement,” it said.

People might think it’s a balancing act, but not to us. It is something that we address quite aggressively,” he said.He also said anything better than what is coming out from the negotiations between the United States and China would be better for the external environment.But even in that scenario of uncertainties, he expects Maybank to still grow, based on the projected gross domestic product growth of its three key markets – Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.Speaking on Maybank’s digitisation plans, Farid said the bank would maintain a conservative-yet-impactful investment to effectively deliver improved customer service through new digital products and services.How the bank does it is by making the investment scarce, thus creating a bit of a competition within the bank.“Our hypothesis is that when it comes to something very uncertain, you have to make the investment scarce to get the good ideas. You cannot be generous because you will waste a lot of money.“Only the best ideas deserve to get the money. We created that kind of condition,” he said.Farid added that Maybank also spent RM130mil on training, as it believes that the staff have the right to get reskilled as the industry moves forward to a new environment.Even the entire board of directors went through 500 man-days of training to learn about artificial intelligence and data analytics, among others.On potential mergers and acquisitions, Farid said the bank is always on the lookout but there is nothing interesting so far.On Maybank’s exposure to Singapore water and power company Hyflux Ltd and whether there would be an impact on its earnings, Farid declined to comment, saying that it was against regulations to talk about specific clients.However, he said any provision and recognition of impairment was done according to MFRS 9 and with the validation from its external auditors and regulators.The AGM yesterday saw shareholders approving all the resolutions tabled, including the final single-tier dividend of 32 sen per share, the re-election of the bank’s retiring directors – Farid, Datuk R.

The founder of Singapore-based water and power company Hyflux Ltd, which could see its court protection from creditors expire at the end of the month, has had a torrid two weeks. A white-knight takeover that might have kept the company together has collapsed, hundreds of angry creditors protested in public, and the government appears set to step in and take over part of the company’s biggest asset for nothing.
How Lum, who earned a string of international accolades as one of the world’s most lauded female entrepreneurs, came to this point has raised questions about the culture of investment in Singapore and rattled the island’s reputation for the checks and balances on how its companies are run.
Saddled with S$2.8bil (US$2.1bil) of unsecured claims and default notices, Hyflux is teetering on the brink of insolvency, leaving thousands of bondholders who stand to lose their money wondering how such a highly respected company could collapse so fast.
At the centre of that question is Lum, 58, an orphan who went from abject poverty to build one of Singapore’s most successful home-grown brands. In the process she garnered the praise of Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong when he opened the nation’s biggest desalination plant in 2013, and made a personal fortune currently valued at US$200mil, according to Bloomberg estimates.
“She was like an Elon Musk of Singapore,” said Ray Ho, 65, a retiree who bought Hyflux bonds and joined a public protest with hundreds of other small investors on March 30 in Singapore’s central business district. “You have not-so-sophisticated investors who buy into a leap of faith because they buy into Olivia Lum.”
Lum’s schedule is now extremely packed and she’s unable to comment for this story, a Hyflux spokesperson said in an email.
Olivia Lum Ooi Lin’s rags-to-riches story has been told many times. Abandoned at birth in the district hospital of Kampar, she was adopted by a widow whom she called “grandmother,” according to her biography in Singapore’s National Library.
Her foster mother was kind to her, but was a compulsive gambler, playing mahjong for hours on end. As she lost money, the family had to quit their terraced house and garden for a hut with a metal roof and bare-earth floor.

By now Lum was a high-flier, lauded by politicians, business groups and the media as a model female entrepreneur. She became a nominated member of parliament in Singapore, one of a handful of lawmakers appointed by the President. At its peak, her net worth was about US$500mil, according to Bloomberg calculations.
While Lum’s early days were spent selling to clients, she remained a scientist at heart. In a 2002 interview with local magazine Her World, which named Lum Woman of the Year, she said the only department she micromanaged was R&D, which still reported directly to her.
The poor orphan had achieved all the trappings of wealth – a Mercedes-Benz, Gucci bag, Prada pumps. She lived in a house with a maid, two dogs, two parrots and a rabbit, according to the magazine interview.
But she continued to clock 16-hour workdays, starting at 10am and holding management meetings at 8pm. And the company continued to prosper. By early 2011, it had a market value of more than US$1.6bil. That year, Lum flew to Monte Carlo to be the first woman presented with Ernst & Young’s World Entrepreneur of the Year award. It was also the year Hyflux won its biggest project: the Tuaspring combined desalination and power plant.
By the time the facility opened in 2013, Hyflux’s expansion was in full spate, especially in the Middle East. The following year, the company announced agreements to build facilities in Oman and Saudi Arabia.
Then oil prices collapsed. In less than seven months, crude fell 60% and Middle Eastern states began to stall or cancel infrastructure projects. For some companies doing business in the region, payments were often delayed and new contracts dried up.
Lum’s risk-taking approach and determination to expand the business had resulted in massive borrowing. To fund Tuaspring, Hyflux raised more than S$1.4bil in bank loans, perpetual bonds and an issue of preferred shares.
Just as a drop in oil prices affected the construction industry in the Middle East, it was a slump in power prices in Singapore as the government deregulated supply that proved the Achilles heel for Hyflux. The Tuaspring project was conceived with the idea that the plant would earn revenue by selling excess power to the nation’s electricity grid. But as power prices fell, the plant began to lose money.
“Olivia Lum could have been more prudent as a manager in particular with Hyflux’s decision to bid for Tuaspring,” said Simon Jong, head of fixed-income research at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “It might have been better to have been more conservative when bidding for the project, to allow for buffers for execution risk and market weakness.”
Among those who helped fund the plant were some 34,000 individual investors who now stand to lose almost everything. Lured by the promise of a 6% annual return forever from a company that was run by one of the nation’s corporate superstars, many invested their retirement savings.
Lum remains positive and is holding up well, according to two people close to her, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. One of them said she feels bad about what happened to the individual investors and wants to do something to help them.
On Feb 16, she offered her stake of 267 million shares and securities as part of SM Investments’ proposed restructuring plan. With the collapse of the deal, Lum is trying to see what else she can do, one of the people said.
Lum is running out of options to turn it around. Hyflux has said it is working with key creditor groups and relevant stakeholders to find a way to pursue alternatives after the SM bid failed. But with the court protection deadline looming, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp credit research suggested that the likelihood of liquidation had increased.
While that may do little to ease the pain of the investors, Lum herself cashed in part of her stake back in 2005, when the stock was near its peak. Property records show her real estate holdings include a two-story house with swimming pool and underground parking that she built on a 2,107 sq m plot on Dalvey Road, in one of the city’s richest neighbourhoods.
While Lum remains financially well off, the empire she spent a lifetime building is coming undone. The company’s dramatic rise and fall has prompted questions about Singapore’s business culture and the readiness of individual investors to back projects that seem to have the seal of government approval, often without understanding the risks. In a note on April 8, S&P Global Ratings warned that more defaults could occur in Singapore.
“Corporate governance in Singapore is not as good as we would like to believe,’’ said Mak at NUS. “Other companies dominated by founders who are unwilling to let go and bring in the right people may go the same way.’’ — Bloomberg"

Anh is chief executive officer of Xuan Hoa Vietnam Joint Stock Co, a furniture company based outside of Hanoi, which has received an influx of international visitors recently. On the back of US-China tariffs on US$360bil in goods last year, Xuan Hoa clients – including Swedish furniture giant Ikea – have re-directed some production from China to Vietnam. At least 10 new prospective clients came calling at Anh’s office from abroad in just the first three months of the year.
“The trade war is bringing more business, for sure,” said Anh, who expects sales to at least double in the next five years. “There are more companies getting in touch with us to switch from China to our products.”
Xuan Hoa has been doing business with Ikea for more than 17 years, and the Swedish furnisher recently started ordering a small, palm-sized metal part from the Vietnamese producer. Xuan Hoa’s price was already about 1,000 dong (four cents) cheaper per part than Ikea’s Chinese supplier, according to Anh, and could’ve potentially widened under a US-China trade war.
“Like any other growing, global company, Ikea is always seeking competitive opportunities in order to secure optimal sourcing to keep costs low for our customers,” Mattias Hennius, a spokesman for Ikea in Sweden, said in an email, without addressing its expanding business with Xuan Hoa specifically.
Vietnam’s appeal rests in part on its reputation as a low-cost location. A factory worker in Vietnam is paid about half of what his peer gets in China, while electricity is cheap because of government subsidies. Vietnam shares a land border with China, which makes it cheaper and easier for factories to source materials and components for manufacturing.
The trade war is accelerating a trend that’s been steadily growing since Vietnam began opening its economy under so-called “doi moi” reforms in the 1980s. 
The economy has evolved into one of the most trade-dependent ones in the world with a dozen signed free-trade agreements. Foreign direct investment has steadily increased since then, but really took off in 2014 after Samsung Electronics Co announced plans to shift production of its smartphones from China to cushion its profits. 
FDI reached US$14.1bil in 2017, making up one-fifth of all inflows into the region, excluding Singapore, according to data compiled by Maybank Kim Eng Research Ltd. “It’s not just a new toy for people to play with – it’s a shiny new toy,” Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, said of investor enthusiasm in Vietnam.
Vietnam has made strides in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business gauge and the World Economic Forum’s Competitiveness Index, and debuted this year at No. 60 in the Bloomberg Innovation Index.
The trade war has acted as an added nudge for businesses to pull the trigger on their Vietnam expansion plans. Apple Inc supplier GoerTek Inc of China, and Taiwanese giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, known also as Foxconn, as well as some of its rivals have all made moves into the South-East Asian country amid the trade war. American home furnisher Haverty Furniture Cos Inc also is ramping up production in Vietnam, citing tariff pressures. — Bloomberg"

The Shenzhen-based company has discussed with potential advisers a share sale that could raise as much as US$1bil, one of the people said. The offering could happen next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.
Vanke would join other Chinese developers such as Country Garden Holdings Co in spinning off their management units, which are less prone to government policy changes and economic cycles. 
Country Garden Services Holdings Co was listed by introduction last year, while China Aoyuan Group Ltd’s services arm raised US$94mil in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) last month.
Deliberations are at early stage, and details including the fundraising size and timeline could change, according to the people. 
A representative for China Vanke didn’t respond to requests for comment, while a representative for the property management unit said they have no current plans for a listing.
Property management and related services were China Vanke’s second-largest revenue generator after property sale. The business contributed 9.8 billion yuan (US$1.5bil), equivalent to about 3.3% of the developer’s total revenue last year, according to its annual report.
MSCI China Real Estate Index has risen 32% this year as the nation’s property market shows signs of a recovery, with home sales surging in March.

Cumulative savings in the basic pension fund that covers urban employees would peak at about 7 trillion yuan (US$1.04 trillion) in 2027 before dropping sharply, the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said in a report. 
Excluding fiscal subsidies, net outflows would have begun this year instead of 2028, according to the report.
The basic pension fund covered 403 million people as of the end of 2017, including 293 million working contributors and 110 million retirees, according to the latest annual report from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.
The forecasts highlight the longer-term challenges facing Chinese leaders in providing a comfortable retirement for workers while tackling short-term headaches including slowing growth and hidden local government debts. 
While the projected scenario doesn’t necessarily suggest a payment crisis, it adds pressure on developing other components of the pension system that includes corporate annuities, the national pension fund and commercial pensions.
“The basic pension insurance system faces the challenges of financial unsustainability for the medium-to-long term,” the report said. 
The problem will become “more prominent” as the government seeks to lower companies’ pension-contribution burden amid slower economic growth.
The basic pension fund’s payment pressure will keep rising from this year, with the average working contributor’s burden more than doubling to almost the entire payments of one retiree by 2050, according to the report. — Bloomberg"

Don’t get us wrong, Tencent has been a great story thus far. The stock with the single biggest weighting in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up about 25% already this year and briefly topped the HK$400 (US$51) level for the first time since June 2018 today after one of its games won regulatory approval in China, according to a statement on the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television’s website.
But beyond Internet giant Tencent and the usual suspects in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics Co, there are other names posting even bigger gains.
Let’s start in Japan, where Softbank Group Corp and Rakuten Inc are up around the 50% mark each this year, among the biggest gainers in the Nikkei 225 Index. Both have gotten a lift amid the battle of the ride-share public offerings. 
Rakuten owns an 11.5% stake in Lyft Inc, while Softbank awaits the pending initial public offering (IPO) of rival Uber Technologies Inc following its deal in late 2017 to acquire a sizable stake in the popular ride service company.
Rakuten’s share price has been volatile since Lyft’s less-than-stellar trading debut at the end of March, with the new stock tumbled 17% in just over two weeks. 
The firm said on April 1 it would book a valuation gain of 110 billion yen in the first quarter after an evaluation of Lyft shares following its IPO.
As for Softbank, it stands to profit handsomely with Uber seeking to raise US$10bil in its IPO, kicking off a road show to market shares this month and begin trading publicly in May, according to people familiar with the matter.
Over in Australia, payment services provider Afterpay Touch Group Ltd is the top-performing stock in the benchmark stock index, with shares more than doubling this year to hit a record high. 
The company is a big part of the emergent WAAAX group of tech stocks (because everyone loves tech acronyms) leading a fresh wave of gains Down Under – WiseTech Global Ltd, Appen Ltd, Altium Ltd and Xero Ltd.
The group has surged some 230% since June 2017, outperforming FAANG and BAT groups in the US and Asia in that time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Over in Hong Kong, Sunny Optical Technology Group Co is the second-best performer in the Hang Seng Index this year, up about 48% to rebound from its first annual loss since 2011 last year.
The lens maker will see sales maintain strong growth of more than 20% in the next 12 months, supported by demand for its multiple-lens high-resolution handset camera from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co and Xiaomi Corp, according to Charles Shum, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.

The blue-chip Dow, held back by industrial stocks, squeaked into positive territory at the closing bell.

The three major U.S. indexes were relatively unchanged following the release of the Fed's minutes, which reaffirmed the central bank's patience regarding future interest rate hikes.

""The Fed notes were kind of a nothing, exactly what the market was expecting"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""It's how the Fed likes to operate. They wanted to reaffirm existing expectations, which they did.""

Core U.S. consumer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy segments, rose at the slowest annual pace in over a year, according to the Labor Department's CPI report. The tepid inflation data further supported the Fed's decision to suspend its three-year, interest-rate-hike campaign.

""The core number shows no inflation and the headline reflects higher gasoline prices, which is a headwind for growth, a tax on consumers,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

Top executives from some of the largest U.S. banks testified before Congress for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, just days before the banks report quarterly results amid lowered expectations by analysts.

Profit forecasts for the first quarter have dropped steadily in the last six months, with S&P 500 earnings now seen falling by 2.5%, which would mark the first year-on-year contraction since 2016, according to Refinitiv data.

Levi Strauss & Co posted a 7% rise in revenue in its first earnings report since returning to the public market . Its shares rose 4.0%.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/eu-offers-pm-may-brexit-pause-to-oct-31/,EU offers PM May Brexit pause to Oct 31,Economy,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",8:09 AM MYT,"BRUSSELS: European Union leaders agreed to grant British Prime Minister Theresa May a new Brexit deadline of Oct. 31, officials said, after French President Emmanuel Macron opposed efforts to give her another year.

""A Brexit extension until 31 October is sensible since it gives time to UK to finally choose its way,"" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat tweeted, adding that a summit in June would let EU leaders ""take stock of the situation"".

Summit chair Donald Tusk he went to brief May on the outcome and seek her necessary agreement to a final deal.

The late-night agreement means Britain will not crash out of the bloc on Friday and gives May more than the three months she had asked for to build a parliamentary majority behind the withdrawal treaty she negotiated with the EU last year.

But Macron's push for a June Brexit and strong opposition to other leaders' preference for a much longer extension that might increase the chances of Britain changing its mind to stay in the bloc meant the meeting ended up with the October compromise.

Oct. 31 would correspond to the end of the five-year mandate of the present EU executive Commission.

Leaders would meet again in June to assess the situation. Britain could have left by then if May succeeds in building a coalition for her deal with the Labour opposition -- though there is no sign of agreement yet.

In order to continue as an EU member beyond June 1, May has agreed to organise British elections to the European Parliament on May 23, though it is still unclear if that vote will go ahead and how far it might turn into a virtual second referendum on EU membership that some hope could mean Britain cancelling Brexit.

The other 27 had all but ruled out pitching Britain, and parts of the EU economy, into chaos on Friday. But a drive by Macron to keep London on a tight leash saw the emergency summit bogged down in late-night wrangling as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others argued the merits of granting up to a year.

As at a summit last month which put back Brexit for two weeks, several EU diplomats said May failed to persuade her peers that she could definitely break the paralysis of repeated failures to ratify the treaty within the coming months.

French officials said the EU faced ""blackmail"" by hardline pro-Brexit potential successors to May, such as Boris Johnson. They might try to sabotage decision-making, they said.

An aide to Macron warned that France could even be ready to let Britain crash out without a treaty to avoid legal limbo and provide a transition to new trading terms: ""Not everything is preferable to a no-deal. A no-deal situation is a real option.""

LAUGHTER WITH MERKEL

However, Merkel has urged the bloc to do all it can to avoid such disruption. She said before leaving Berlin that she favoured a delay of ""several months"" for May, who has pledged to quit if hardcore Brexit supporters in her own Conservative Party drop objections to her ""soft Brexit"" and help ratify the deal.

Keen to ease tension, Merkel had broken the ice as talks began by showing May a photomontage on a tablet of both wearing similar jackets when addressing their parliaments earlier in the day. It provoked mutual laughter as other leaders joined in.

As talks wore on beyond midnight, with May patiently waiting elsewhere in the building for word on her nation's fate, Macron rallied support for his concerns about a long extension.

May said on arrival that she did not want a long delay: ""I want us to be able to leave the European Union in a smooth and orderly way as soon as possible,"" she told reporters.

Her EU peers, however, are sceptical about her ability to break the deadlock soon and discussed a proposal by Tusk of a ""flextension"" of up to a year. This, some argued, could increase pressure on May's pro-Brexit critics to back her deal rather than risk Brexit fizzling out.

EU leaders are exasperated with May's handling of a tortuous and costly divorce that is a distraction from ensuring the bloc can hold its own against global economic challenges.

Across from the summit venue, the EU executive celebrated its part in funding a global project that produced the first picture of a black hole, prompting no shortage of ironic comments on social media about the juxtaposition.

Blogger Eliot Higgins tweeted: ""We're now more certain about what black holes look like than what Brexit looks like."" - Reuters"

Trump's decision to slap tariffs of 10 to 25 percent on about $250 billion of Chinese goods has roiled U.S. retailers and manufacturers, who are scrambling to avoid potentially crippling cost increases.

Overall U.S. imports of containerized freight from China fell 6.4 percent during the first quarter as buyers worked off product stockpiled ahead of tariff increases and rerouted orders to lower-cost countries, S&P Global Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva said in the report.

U.S. imports of Chinese-made furniture by retailers such as IKEA, Home Depot, Target Corp and Room to Go fell 13.5 percent in the first quarter. That was partly offset by a 37.2 percent rise in shipments from Vietnam and a 19.3 percent increase in imports from Taiwan, Panjiva said.

The change also affected home appliances.

Imports of Chinese refrigerators fell 24.1 percent during the quarter, when shipments from South Korea and Mexico jumped 31.8 percent and 32 percent, respectively.

""A major factor in that shift has been a rearrangement in supply chains by Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics,"" Panjiva said in the report.

The auto industry has also been rethinking trade routes.

Tire imports from China slumped 28.6 percent during the first three months of the year. At the same time, U.S. sea ports saw a 141.7 surge in product from Vietnam and an 11.1 percent increase in tire shipments from South Korea. Hankook Tire and Nexen are among the suppliers picking up the new business, Panjiva said.

U.S. companies are also shifting factory investments in the wake of the China trade tiff, which a trio of economists estimate has already cost U.S. consumers and companies $19.2 billion.

Ohio-based Cooper Tire & Rubber Co in December said it formed a joint venture with Sailun Vietnam Co Ltd. to build a truck and bus radial tire factory near Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City.

""We are excited about this addition to our manufacturing footprint, which diversifies our sourcing to protect against risk, including tariffs,"" Cooper Chief Financial Officer Christopher Eperjesy said in February, when the company announced a $34 million write-down on the value of a joint venture manufacturing project in China. - Reuters"

In a note, the research house maintained its underperform rating on Axiata with an unchanged target price of RM3.65.

To recap, Axiata previously paid a sum of US$227mil on behalf of TenliaSonera Group, which was NCell's vendor ordered to pay capital gains tax for its sale to Axiata.

The Swedish-Finnish telco had refused to pay, arguing that the shell company, Reynolds Holdings, that sold its Ncell stake to Axiata should not attract taxes in Nepal as it was registered in Saint Kitts and Nevis.

""We understand that Axiata has booked in USD157m as negative goodwill and in the event of non-recovery, the net earnings impact on Axiata would be USD70m,"" said PublicInvest.

Given that Axiata has already paid US$227mil, the order by the Supreme Court could mean an additional tax bill of US$340mil, based on PublicInvest's estimates.

The research house said Axiata should have sufficient funding to pay for the tax as it recently raised RM1.65bil via the sale of Singapore's M1 Ltd."

The British pound was little changed after European leaders agreed to extend the deadline for UK to leave the union to the end of October, averting a potential crash out of the bloc on Friday with no divorce deal.

""There were big worries last year that central banks globally are moving towards policy tightening. Those fears have reversed now,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP.

""There have also been easings in Asia. That is a reasonably positive backdrop for equities,"" Oliver added.

""The complication is the growth slowdown.""

On Wednesday, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept its loose policy stance and warned that threats to global economic growth remained. The ECB has already pushed back its first post-crisis interest rate hike, and President Mario Draghi raised the prospect of more support for the struggling euro zone economy if its slowdown persisted.

In response, European bank stocks declined and the yield on Germany's benchmark 10-year bond fell to a one-week low of negative 0.039 percent.

Separately, data showed U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in 14 months in March but underlying inflation remained benign against a backdrop of slowing global economic growth.

Minutes from a March 19-20 meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers showed they agreed to be patient about any changes to its interest rate policy as they saw the U.S. economy weathering a global slowdown without a recession in the next few years.

U.S. Treasury yields slipped in response, reinforcing expectations that the Fed would hold rates steady or possibly cut them by the end of the year.

However, AMP's Oliver said some encouraging economic signs were now emerging, helped by the ""great retreat"" on policy by global central banks, fiscal stimulus in China and progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday the United States and China have largely agreed on a mechanism to ensure that both sides stick to the deal, including establishing new ""enforcement offices.""

Investors will next focus on inflation data from China at 0130 GMT. A weak number could raise fears of deflation spreading across the world, while a pick-up could add to optimism that government support measures are slowly beginning to percolate through the economy.

In currencies, the dollar index fell for a fourth straight day to 96.909. The euro was barely changed at $1.1278 while the Japanese yen paused after three days of gains at 111.03.

The agrochemicals market space is valued at about RM800mil domestically and RM2.1bil in indonesia.

PublicInvest noted that the group dominates the market with over 500 branded agrochemical products.

There are also high barriers to entry due to the highly regulated nature of the importation and production of pesticides. 

""Stringent registration procedures for a pesticide product could take up to 2 years,"" said the research house.

It added that the group has other advantages such as an extensive distribution and stable procurement network, a flexible business model that buffers against cost fluctuations and strong R&D capabilities.

The chief executive of the superannuation fund, Nik Amlizan Mohamed said on Thursday that JAN or the National Audit Department had issued the qualified opinion pertaining to  Note 33 and 13 of LTAT's FY17 financial statements.

She said JAN’s qualified opinion, Note 33 involved LTAT’s revenue for FY17 and the proceeds from a sale pertaining to property development amounting to RM202.71mil, which should not have been taken into account in the Financial Statements of LTAT for FY17. 

“This transaction does not comply with Financial Reporting Standards 118 relating to revenue, and does not comply with the materiality level against net profit, income and total asset and non-compliance to the clauses in the property sale and purchase agreement. 

“Note 13 involves Available For Sale Securities amounting to RM1.602bil. Impairment for two Available For Sale Securities amounting to RM88.90mil was not reported in the Financial Statements of LTAT for FY17,” she said. 

Nik Amlizan said according to JAN the fair value for the two shares as at end of FY17 amounted to RM18.46mil compared with the purchase cost of RM107.36mil. 

Significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost is consideration to determine impairment for these two shares. 

“As such, impact from these findings as highlighted in JAN’s Qualified Opinion, has caused LTAT’s profit for the FY17 to be reduced from RM662.17mil to RM370.56mil. 

“In addition, LTAT’s retained earnings would drop drastically to negative retained earnings of RM31.6mil from positive retained earnings of RM259.99mil previously,” she said. 

The delay in FY18 accounts is due to the late submission of FY17 accounts. LTAT is also of the view that with the finalised audited accounts of FY17 being in negative territory for its retained earnings, this will have a profound impact on its results for FY18. 

“We are in the midst of finalising our accounts for FY18 and we expect to announce our results by July 2019,” it said."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/trump-trade-war-turns-vietnamese-furniture-maker-into-a-winner/,Trump’s trade war turns Vietnamese furniture maker into a winner,Corporate News,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",2:16 PM MYT,"SINGAPORE: While the U.S. and China both scramble to limit losses in their ongoing trade war, Vietnam’s Le Duy Anh is adding to his winnings.

Anh is chief executive officer of Xuan Hoa Vietnam Joint Stock Co., a furniture company based outside of Hanoi, which has received an influx of international visitors recently. 

On the back of U.S.-China tariffs on $360 billion in goods last year, Xuan Hoa clients -- including Swedish furniture giant Ikea -- have re-directed some production from China to Vietnam. 

At least 10 new prospective clients came calling at Anh’s office from abroad in just the first three months of the year.

“The trade war is bringing more business, for sure,” said Anh, who expects sales to at least double in the next five years. 

“There are more companies getting in touch with us to switch from China to our products.”

Xuan Hoa has been doing business with Ikea for more than 17 years, and the Swedish furnisher recently started ordering a small, palm-sized metal part from the Vietnamese producer. 

Xuan Hoa’s price was already about 1,000 dong (4 cents) cheaper per part than Ikea’s Chinese supplier, according to Anh, and could’ve potentially widened under a U.S.-China trade war.

Low Cost
“Like any other growing, global company, Ikea is always seeking competitive opportunities in order to secure optimal sourcing to keep costs low for our customers,” Mattias Hennius, a spokesman for Ikea in Sweden, said in an email, without addressing its expanding business with Xuan Hoa specifically.

Vietnam’s appeal rests in part on its reputation as a low-cost location. A factory worker in Vietnam is paid about half of what his peer gets in China, while electricity is cheap because of government subsidies. 

Vietnam shares a land border with China, which makes it cheaper and easier for factories to source materials and components for manufacturing.

The trade war is accelerating a trend that’s been steadily growing since Vietnam began opening its economy under so-called “doi moi” reforms in the 1980s. The economy has evolved into one of the most trade-dependent ones in the world with a dozen signed free-trade agreements.

Foreign direct investment has steadily increased since then, but really took off in 2014 after Samsung Electronics Co. announced plans to shift production of its smartphones from China to cushion its profits. 

FDI reached $14.1 billion in 2017, making up one-fifth of all inflows into the region, excluding Singapore, according to data compiled by Maybank Kim Eng Research Ltd.

“It’s not just a new toy for people to play with -- it’s a shiny new toy,” Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, said of investor enthusiasm in Vietnam.

Vietnam has made strides in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business gauge and the World Economic Forum’s Competitiveness Index, and debuted this year at No. 60 in the Bloomberg Innovation Index.

The trade war has acted as an added nudge for businesses to pull the trigger on their Vietnam expansion plans. Apple Inc. supplier GoerTek Inc. of China, and Taiwanese giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known also as Foxconn, as well as some of its rivals have all made moves into the Southeast Asian country amid the trade war. 

American home furnisher Haverty Furniture Cos Inc. also is ramping up production in Vietnam, citing tariff pressures.

It’s showing up in the export numbers too, with Vietnam’s shipments holding up as trade elsewhere takes a knock. Exports rose 12.4 percent in the second half of 2018 from a year ago, outpacing the five biggest economies in Southeast Asia, according to data compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc.

‘Favorable’ View
Investors say Vietnam still has much work to do to improve its business environment: rooting out corruption, improving and expanding infrastructure, especially for transport, and making sure manufacturing can move steadily up the value chain.

Like Southeast Asia’s five biggest economies, Vietnam counts China as its top trading partner, making it difficult for the nation to choose sides in a trade war. But for Anh and an overwhelming majority of his fellow Vietnamese, there’s a clear bias toward the U.S.

Vietnam tops the list among countries whose residents hold an “unfavorable” opinion of China, at 88 percent versus No. 2 Japan at 83 percent, according to the Spring 2017 Pew Global Attitudes Survey. 

Vietnamese affections for the U.S. -- 84 percent hold “favorable” opinions of the country -- rank behind only that of U.S. citizens for their nation, the data show.

For a country that suffered a decades-long, brutal war against the U.S., referred to domestically as “the American War,” Vietnamese enthusiasm to see the U.S. as a partner underlines their ambition as an open, internationally connected economy.

Ha Van Thanh, an assembly worker who’s been with Xuan Hoa for 22 years, said he doesn’t follow the trade-war news much, but sees the benefits for Vietnam.

“I believe it’s quite good for Vietnam to do business with the U.S. as well as the U.S. to work with us because many of our products can compete well with Chinese products,” he said. 

“The U.S. is a good market which we can supply.” - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/china-consumer-inflation-surge-seen-as-unlikely-to-shift-pboc/,China consumer inflation surge seen as unlikely to shift PBOC,Economy,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",2:32 PM MYT,"BEIJING: China’s consumer prices surged on the back of temporary food supply factors, while factory inflation provided further evidence of a nascent economic recovery.

Consumer inflation accelerated to 2.3 percent in March from a year earlier, up from 1.5 percent in February and posting the biggest jump in more than a year.

The surge was mostly led by rising vegetable and pork prices, which drove the CPI up by more than half a percentage point, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, stayed flat at 1.8 percent, and factory inflation halted a dis-inflationary slide, gaining 0.4 percent.

Because the inflation rebound was driven by food-price increases that may prove temporary, the central bank is unlikely to abandon its policy of keeping cheap money flowing to the private sector for now. Lingering deflation risks and uncertainties over the trade war and the sustainability of the economic upswing also argue for caution.

“Monetary policy won’t make adjustments, and overall inflation won’t be a big issue for this year” because core inflation remains steady and factory-gate prices will stay at a low level going forward, said Ding Shuang, chief China and North Asia economist at Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. 

The People’s Bank of China is likely in an “observation window” at the moment.

Pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket, rose 5.1 percent in March, the first increase after 25 months of decline. That alone drove the CPI to rise 0.12 percentage point, the NBS said in a statement. Over a million hogs were culled in an outbreak of African swine fever and pig feed output has dropped.

Rebounding factory prices signal a further firming in the nascent economic recovery, which if sustained give firms greater pricing power, aid profits and the help them repay their debts.

“The PBOC still have good reasons to cut reserve-requirement ratios again because there’ll be tax collection and maturing medium-term lending soon,” Ding from the Standard Chartered Bank Ltd said.

“Even if there’ll be policy shifts, it probably won’t come from monetary policy as it’s never been very loose”, he said, adding the pace of fiscal expenditure can slow down to save some bullets, if the economy does turn around.

The outlook for producer-price inflation is still modest. The PPI index will likely grow by just 0.3 percent in 2019, according to the median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey, down from a forecast of 0.8 percent in February. - Bloomberg"

Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) holds US$1.96bil (RM8.0bil) or 5.3% of Malaysia's government securities (MGS) as at end-March 2019. 

“If the entire RM8.0bil flows out of our MGS at the same time, it will impact the ringgit against the US dollar, weakening the local currency by 0.62% while the 10-year MGS yield will rise by 7bps. 

“However, we believe the outflow of the RM8.0bil will be gradual and hence will not cause a major impact,” it said in a research note on Thursday.

GPFG, which is the world's largest, announced it would streamline its US$300bil fixed-income portfolio by cutting emerging market bonds from the benchmark index it tracks. This would impact Malaysia and nine other countries.

Currently worth US$1.05 trillion, GPFG has invested around 30% in fixed income and the balance 70% in equities. Its latest decision did not affect the equities market. 

AmBank Research said besides the fund’s fairly low exposure of 5.3% to total foreign holdings in Malaysia's MGS, “the strong liquidity in our bond market, added with healthy macro fundamentals such as steady growth, healthy reserves, current account surplus, low inflation and real money flows should support yields”. 

The research house is projecting the 10-year MGS yield at 3.75% to 3.80% as our “prudent” levels with room to reach 3.70% if a 25bps Overnight Policy Rate rate cut is instituted. 

If there is no rate cut, it expects the10-year yield to move back to its original levels of 3.90% to 4%. 

“We expect total gross issuance of MGS/GII in the primary market for 2019 to hover between RM120bil and RM125bil with the ringgit corporate bond and Sukuk market total issuance at RM80bil to RM85bil for the year,” it said."

It will also establish an investigation committee to execute the recommendations proposed by the forensic audit report. 
Besides this, it will improve the standard operating procedure to ensure accountability in the running of Felda, as well as study the amendment of acts/regulations in line with the new Felda business model.

FGV was involved in three core businesses, namely, plantations, logistics and support services, while FIC operated as an investment holding company in the non-plantation sector such as in property, hospitality and strategic investments both locally and overseas.Felda would only be involved in managing the estates of its settlers and small-sized industries.As part of the proposed listing of FGV, Felda handed over the management of its commercial estate land via a land lease agreement (LLA) and almost its entire downstream activities to FGV in 2012.Based on the LLA, Felda would receive a fixed amount payment of RM248mil per year from FGV and also a 15% share of operating profit from the sale of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) derived from the estate land leased.However, the average net income received by Felda, amounting to RM400mil a year, is “way too low” when compared with the RM800mil per year forecast earlier.Hence, there was a drastic drop in Felda’s revenue until the group began to post losses in 2013, and later, experienced a further deficit on the back of its normal expenses and commitment , which remained the same.Felda has also failed to efficiently manage the proceeds from the listing exercise of FGV in mid-2012. Of the total RM10.5bil proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO), Felda received RM6bil while the remaining RM4.5bil was distributed to FGV. The proceeds were meant for strategic investments that would benefit the settlers in the long term, the White Paper pointed out.Felda, however, spent RM1.4bil (24%) on new non-profitable investments and RM4.6bil (76%) on non-productive expenses. FGV, on its part, spent RM3.3bil (73%) from its RM4.5bil IPO proceeds on investments and non-profitable developments such as acquisitions of several companies.The remaining RM1.2bil (27%) was used for working capital and other expenses.The White Paper also highlighted that there was a conflict of interest in the administration and operations of the Felda Group. “The appointment of Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad as the chairman of the Felda board of directors and also the chairman of Felda’s various associate companies such as FIC, FIC Properties Sdn Bhd and FGV went against normal good corporate management practices as well as the check-and-balance mechanism.“He also held the director’s post in  20 subsidiaries and other Felda-interest related companies,” said the report.Furthermore, the inefficient corporate management administration under the previous Felda management team has led to the group losing a sustainable business model.“The failure of Felda’s (former) board of directors and management team to put in a professional and capable team to undertake large-scale investments has exposed Felda to many risks.“Weak internal management and a lack of accountability and integrity have also resulted in Felda suffering huge losses,” added the paper. Based on its audit forensic investigations, the new Felda management discovered several dubious practices and misappropriation in the return and investment process from the meeting minutes of the Felda Board and FIC together with other related documents, whereby the purchase of property under Felda and FIC was made under the name of Isa and FIC chief executive officer Mohd Zaid Abdul Jalil -  without a due diligence process and the approval of the Felda board. Another point worth mentioning is the aggressive and uncontrolled investments undertaken by both Felda and FIC. The White Paper said: “The investment decisions, which were made without proper planning and due diligence process, have caused Felda and FIC to succumb to severe losses from the investment in non-strategic companies.”Furthermore, the bulk of the acquired assets were bought above the market price and were not able to generate the much-expected returns.   “Hence, these non-strategic investments have affected the sustainability of the group’s financial position, which later affected its entire operations,” added the report.Related stories:White paper reveals Felda made several bad investment decisionsFelda impacted by FGV’s poor investmentsFelda to embark on group-wide structural reformNew Felda schemes targeted for settlersWeak financials a key challengeIrregularities in Felda’s London investmentsKL Vertical City project: Poor management by FIC"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/put-option-put-down/,White paper reveals Felda made several bad investment decisions,Plantations,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) has made quite a number of bad investment decisions, according to the White Paper released by the Economic Affairs Ministry.
In addition, it has been revealed that the “put option” in Felda’s deal to acquire a 37% stake in Indonesian planter PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk (EHP) from PT Rajawali is not as straightforward as it seems.
According to the White Paper, based on forensic studies conducted by Ernst & Young, the asset value of Felda’s eight investments, which cost the group some RM4.4bil, has dropped by 50% to about RM2.2bil based on information in its audited accounts.
The paper said Felda’s accounting reports over the last few years have also been inaccurate.
“There was complete disregard of Felda’s investing processes, lack of due diligence and risk management by Felda’s board when making its investment decisions,’’ it noted.
What is obvious is that Felda significantly overpaid for its 37% stake or US$505mil in EHP from Rajawali. 
The key findings  are that the acquisition of EHP shares at US$505mil (US$0.043/rupiah 584 per share) on Dec 23, 2016 was way higher than two independent valuation prices of US$264mil and US$404mil.
The acquisition price was 95.86% higher compared to EHP’s market price on the date of the acquisition.
Furthermore, another finding showed that when Felda’s board approved the acquisition of EHP shares via a special-purpose vehicle at the same price on Dec 7, 2017, EHP’s market price was even lower at US$0.0098/rupiah 135 per share. This means that Felda agreed to buy EHP shares 344.12% higher than its market price at that time.

 

Another important finding is that the supposed “put option” in the EHP agreement that would negate unwarranted financial losses to Felda is not straightforward, and comes with conditions. 
Former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had said that Felda’s interest was protected, as it had an option to sell back its shares in EHP at the original purchase price on top of a 6% interest charge imposed on the Indonesian firm.
However, the forensic studies revealed that Felda would only be able to recoup its investment amount and profit at a rate of 6% a year in Year 5 from the vendor (Company A1) via the “put option” (Company A1 is a private company in Indonesia). 
The put option can only be triggered if any of these takes place:
> EHP goes against its obligation of abiding by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
> EHP fails to get its RSPO certification within two years.
> Company A1 commits a material breach.
> Company A1 or the major shareholder of company A1 or EHP initiates or consents to judicial proceedings in relation to itself under any applicable liquidation, insolvency, composition, reorganization, etc.
There is also no evidence to show that a credit assessment was conducted by Felda on Company A1 in 2016, with regard to its ability to repay the full investment via the put option should that scenario take place. 
Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali rebutted Najib’s defence of the EHP deal.
Speaking in the Dewan Rakyat, Azmin yesterday revealed that Felda had been prevented from exercising the put option due to opposition from Rajawali.
“Early this year, Felda issued a notice to EHP to exercise the put option. What happened? They fought it and refused (to comply),” he said.
“They took Felda to court. After the court granted Felda’s application, Rajawali initiated an arbitration action against Felda,” he added.
The White Paper revealed that the board of directors in Felda had approved the investment in EHP despite knowing that the boards of FGV Holdings Bhd and Felda Investment Corp Sdn Bhd (FIC) did not support the acquisition due to its high valuations.
“The acquisition price was US$241mil higher than its market price from the assessment report. Shares in EHP had dropped 41.6% from June 11, 2015 to Oct 15, 2015,” revealed the White Paper.
Furthermore, Bank Negara had issued many questions with regard to the investment structure, benefits of the acquisition and the usage of capital.
Despite knowing the risks involved, Felda’s board approved the investment without additional due diligence and without any explanation during its minute meetings. 
For some background, Felda’s board of directors had approved the acquisition of exchangeable bonds for shares in EHP via FIC Properties Sdn Bhd (FPSB) for US$505.4mil in December 2015. 
On Oct 16, 2016, Felda’s board approved the change of structure in the EHP investment to a 37% stock acquisition instead, but at the same value of US$505.4mil. 
Felda would make this acquisition from a private company in Indonesia (Company A1) and this deal came with the put option.
FPSB signed a sale and purchase agreement on Dec 31, 2016. 
The Finance Ministry (MoF) was also involved in this investment process, as it gave advice on the structuring of the investment.
The acquisition was paid via a loan amounting to RM2.3bil from Govco Holdings Bhd, which is a company under the MoF.
A corporate guarantee was given by Felda at a rate of cost of financing plus 15 basis points. This loan would need to be repaid in seven years.
Checks showed that Company A1 had already gotten EHP shares in November 2014 at a price of US$0.0247/rupiah 300 per share.
There is also an impairment of value of RM1.58bil for Felda’s financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 via the entry “fair value through profit or loss”.
The investment in EHP also went against Felda’s investing principles. 
This is because the acquisition of EHP shares, even with the put option, would have only given a return of 6% a year. Felda’s investing principles call for a minimum return that is higher than the average market return rate. 
Besides, the net return of 1.05% a year was also lower than the minimum fixed rate of 1.15% set by Felda’s board for the deal. As of Dec 31, 2017, that net return had dropped to 0.9%.Related stories:Weak management team caused Felda’s downfallFelda to embark on group-wide structural reformFelda impacted by FGV’s poor investmentsNew Felda schemes targeted for settlersWeak financials a key challengeIrregularities in Felda’s London investmentsKL Vertical City project: Poor management by FIC"

Ekovest Bhd , its warrants and Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd  (IWC) took the top-three spots of the most actively traded counters on Bursa Malaysia yesterday.
IWC went up to its one-year high of RM1.01, increasing 18.1% or 15.5 sen from its previous close. This was the first time the counter hit the RM1 mark since April 2 last year when it closed at RM1.06.
A total of 151.03 shares were traded. The counter faced its first resistance at 88 sen and its first support at 82 sen.
Ekovest closed 16.5% higher at 63.5 sen, with 196.9 million shares changing hands. Its first resistance was at 55.3 sen and its first support was at 53.3 sen.
Its warrants jumped 114.29% or eight sen from seven sen to 15 sen.
Lim is the founder and executive vice-chairman of IWC and the co-founder and chairman of Ekovest.
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad announced on Tuesday that Malaysia was exploring proposals aimed at reducing the cost of the HSR project.
He said the country would discuss the matter further with Singapore before the end of the project’s suspension period on May 31, 2020 during a joint-press conference with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Construction counters have been on the rise in recent months, as punters bet on the potential revival of mega-infrastructure projects that came under scrutiny and were put on hold after Pakatan Harapan dethroned Barisan Nasional to form the government in May last year.
It was also previously reported that the revival of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) also drove the uptrend of construction stocks.
The construction of the 688-km long rail link was suspended last July after the new government found irregularities in the terms of the “lopsided” contract would cost between RM34.4bil and RM41.3bil.
The continuation of the project is expected to be ironed out by Dr Mahathir, who is scheduled to visit China from April 24 to 28 at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend the second Belt and Road Initiative summit."

Speaking at a press briefing held in conjunction with the group’s AGM yesterday, Carlsberg Malaysia managing director Lars Lehmann said there should not be further product price increases given that the group had hedged the prices of its raw materials for the year.
“Malt prices were up by 15% to 20% this year due to bad barley harvests in Europe and Australia.
“On the other hand, glass bottle prices increased by 4% in 2019, as compared to last year.
“We have hedged our needs for the rest of 2019, particularly for malt and barley, which are the two major raw material components,” he said, adding that the product price increase introduced earlier this month would offset any extra increase in raw material prices.
Carlsberg Malaysia adjusted the price of certain products to distributors and retailers between 3% to 6%, effective April 1, 2019.
Meanwhile, the EU-Singapore trade agreement, which is due to be implemented in the fourth quarter of this year, will result in tougher competition from imports in Singapore. 
Beer imported from the EU into Singapore will not be imposed import tax, resulting in an increase in pricing competition.
However, Lehmann said this development will not be a huge impact to the group and it will not completely change the momentum of the group’s business in Singapore.
Going forward, Lehmann hinted that the group is looking to introduce alcohol-free beverages, in a move to secure new revenue streams.
“It could be classic non-alcoholic versions of our existing drinks, like removing the alcohol content from Carlsberg. “Or, it could be new product segments — we are unable to disclose further at this point in time. “It is important that our new product(s) are the right solutions for our Malaysian consumers,” he said.

Africa for new Navara model,Auto,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"JOHANNESBURG: Nissan Motor Co plans to invest a further 3 billion rand (US$213mil) in its South African plant to prepare for production of the latest version of the Navara pickup.
The decision by the Japanese carmaker may add 30,000 units to the plant’s current annual volume of 35,000, Mike Whitfield, managing director of Nissan Africa, said at the factory north of Pretoria yesterday. The manufacture of the Navara from 2020 will also create jobs in a country where more than one in four of the population are unemployed.
“Automotive is already the largest part of South Africa’s manufacturing sector, contributing around 7% of gross domestic product annually and accounting for a third of manufacturing output,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said at the Nissan facility in Rosslyn.
Nissan’s investment is the first significant commitment by an automaker since international firms agreed with the government late last year to extend a manufacturing incentive programme through 2035. The plan has also seen the likes of Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG operate plants in the country, in return for generous tax breaks. The majority of vehicles are produced for export.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/chinas-economy-is-looking-better-and-better/,China’s economy is looking better and better,Economy,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"HONG KONG: It’s springtime for China bulls.
Analysts from banks including HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are increasingly confident that the world’s second-biggest economy is finding its feet after a rocky start to the year. Corporate tax cuts, an upswing in manufacturing and expected progress on a US trade deal are among the factors buoying optimism.
It’s not just sell-side analysts. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its forecast for Chinese growth by 0.1 point to 6.3% this year even as it cut its outlook for global growth to the lowest since the financial crisis.
The better tone is being reflected in China’s markets. Stocks are up 31% from a January low and the yuan has strengthened 2.4% against the dollar.
China’s central role in global manufacturing and as a vital source of final demand are among reasons why a large pick-up in the March PMI is a key signal for global factories too, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists led by Ethan Harris, head of global economics research wrote in a note dated April 5. “Policy makers have responded to the US-China trade war with a ’do-whatever-it-takes’ approach to supporting growth, taking on a wide array of easing measures. Financial conditions have started to improve and the large increase in the March manufacturing PMI might be the first indication that economic activity is bottoming out,” they wrote.
The likelihood for strong credit data, stabilizing trade volumes and a modest rebound in factory prices are reasons why Morgan Stanley strategists are increasingly upbeat.
“All these factors suggest to us that the prospects for the Chinese economy are bullish and we expect China risk assets to perform well on the back of this,” they wrote.
Citigroup Inc. metals analysts including Maximilian Layton wrote on April 7 that “market participants should ‘chase’ this year’s rally” as data are set to improve.
HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Julia Wang estimate that tax reductions announced last month are equivalent to over 2% of projected 2019 gross domestic product, making them the biggest in a decade. 
Those cuts and other measures will trigger a self-sustained recovery, they wrote in a note dated April 8. — Bloomberg"

The airport operator said three international carriers which operate the Boeing 737 MAX to the KL International Airport (KLIA) had switched to other aircraft types after the Ethiopian Air incident on March 10.
It also said that Indonesian carriers are seen to reduce flight frequencies after the Lion Air crash in October 2018 which is also related to the Boeing 737 MAX. 
“The recent grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX may have further negative impact on Indonesian carriers’ capacity to Malaysia.
However, the impact from this may not be significant as most of the Indonesian sectors have competing operators,” it said in its monthly passenger traffic update.
Passenger traffic at KLIA in March was little changed at 5.2 million passengers. March 2019 passenger movements for KLIA’s main terminal declined by 0.6%, while klia2 increased by 0.6%, it said.
MAHB said domestic air travel remained busy in the first quarter of this year, with 15 airports across the country recording growth in passenger traffic.
Growth, according to the airport operator, was driven by additional seat capacity offered by airlines.   
MAHB, which operates all airports in the country except for the Senai Airport in Johor, said passenger movement rose 3.9% in the first quarter ended March 31 (Q1) to 25.4 million travellers.
“Malaysia’s Q1 2019 growth was driven by the domestic sector, partly due to the higher seat capacity offered by airlines to match air travel demand,” it said.
Local airports that registered double-digit growth were Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Melaka, Ipoh, Kuantan, Tawau, Labuan, Bintulu and Sibu.
MAHB said domestic traffic grew 7.7% in the first quarter, faster compared with the international segment’s growth of 0.6%.
Aircraft movements at local airports grew by 0.7% in Q1 2019 over Q1 2018. International movements declined by 2.1% while domestic sector increased by 2.5% over the same period. Total passenger traffic at all airports managed by MAHB, including in Turkey, climbed 3.7% in the first quarter 33.4 million passengers.
International traffic registered 3.4% growth with 16.1million passengers while domestic passenger movements increased by 4% with 17.4million passengers.
“The overall passenger movement of 3.7% growth for the network of airport in Q1 2019 was driven by both international and domestic sector albeit with a different traffic backdrop for Malaysia and Istanbul SGIA,” MAHB said.
Moving forward, the future seat capacity filings by airlines remain above expectation and MAHB said it is cautiously optimistic that the projected 4.9% growth for 2019 would be achievable."

“We see a lot of areas where we feel that Geely can add both insights and competence,” including in the domestic Chinese market and with “certain technologies,” chief executive officer Martin Lundstedt said in an interview.
Geely invested €3.25bil (US$3.7bil) in Volvo in December 2017, adding to Chinese billionaire Li Shufu’s growing global footprint. 
Li is the biggest shareholder in Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler AG, owns the Volvo Cars nameplate and controls Lotus sports cars.
Geely plans to make Lynk & Co branded cars in Europe from 2020.
At the time it took the stake in Volvo trucks, Geely said it sought to contribute on electrification, autonomous driving and connectivity to boost development of the Swedish company.
“We have a good relationship and dialogue with our colleagues at” Volvo, Geely said in an email, declining to comment on details at this stage.
Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Li’s privately-held company, rose 2.2% at 3:01 pm local time. Volvo rose 0.7% in Stockholm.
While Daimler and Geely have agreed to collaborate on car-sharing and ride-hailing services in China as well as building the German company’s Smart city cars, Volvo hasn’t so far outlined cooperation projects with the Chinese shareholder. 
Lundstedt declined to specify any details about talks with Geely.
“Experience and what has been expressed has been very positive,” he said, speaking at the Bauma trade fair in Munich where Volvo presented electric compact excavators and compact wheel loaders that will go on sale next year. 
The construction-equipment division contributed a third of operating profit last year and generated a 13.4% margin on revenue. exceeding the 10.5% return on sales at Volvo’s larger trucks division. Volvo boosted operating profit last year and raised its dividend, saying in January that it expects demand in key markets to hold up in the face of growing economic uncertainty.
Since then, headwinds in Europe have increased, with Brexit unresolved and Italy slipping into recession at the end of 2018.
Germany’s economic growth this year is expected to slow to less than half the rate previously expected amid global trade disputes. 
Volvo is on “strong ground” to meet any increasing challenges, even as markets are expected to weaken, Lundstedt said.
“Recession might be a strong word, which we already guided for during the fourth quarter report, but some sort of correction is rather expected, actually,” he said. — Bloomberg"

The move by VW, the largest foreign automaker in China, to buy into JAC Motors is the latest step by foreign automakers to increase their stakes in their Chinese joint-venture partners or in the ventures themselves since Beijing relaxed ownership rules last year in the world’s biggest car market.
Rival German automaker BMW agreed in October to buy control of its main joint venture in the country for €3.6bil (US$4.05bil). Daimler AG also plans to increase its stake in local partner BAIC Motor.
Foreigners were previously prevented from controlling any Chinese automaker or joint venture. Beijing last year removed such caps for firms making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Limits on commercial vehicles makers ease in 2020 and by 2022 for the wider car market.
VW, which has a market capitalisation of €75bil, is not currently a shareholder in Shanghai-listed JAC, which has a market value of about US$1.7bill, according to Refinitiv data.
The German car giant’s plans are at an early stage but it is keen to take a big stake, said the sources. The sources said it will seek to buy shares from JAC’s major shareholders, which are mainly state-backed firms owning over 40%, showed Refinitiv data.
JAC’s parent, Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holding, holds a 24% stake and is fully controlled by the local government.
When contacted by Reuters, VW said: “We are carefully watching what the implications are for our business and for our joint-venture partners. In this regard we will explore all possible options together with all stakeholders to secure long-term success in China.”
JAC and its parent didn’t respond to requests for comment. Goldman declined to comment.
JAC is trading at a trailing price-to-book ratio of 0.84, which means VW would have to pay a premium for shares since JAC’s state shareholders cannot sell shares for less than their book value.
The Chinese automaker’s shares jumped and hit the daily 10% maximum increase limit yesterday afternoon. VW shares were indicated to start trading flat.
Wolfsburg-based VW, which delivered 4.21 million cars in mainland China and Hong Kong last year, has operated in China for decades and, besides JAC, has joint ventures with state-owned FAW Group and SAIC Motor.
It formed its 50:50 JV with JAC in 2017 to research and develop zero-emission passenger cars as the German automaker has committed almost one-third of the industry’s EV spending, about US$91bil, betting big on the Chinese market.
It looks to shift a large part of its planned EV production in China to JAC if it ends up operating the local automaker after a stake purchase, said one of the people.
JAC warned in January of a 770 million yuan net loss for 2018 mainly due to a drop in car sales, compared to a 432 million yuan profit in 2017. Excluding exceptional items such as government subsidies, losses would reach 1.9 billion yuan, the company said. It will release annual results on April 30.
China last month toughened up its EV subsidies amid concerns that generous local government support designed to produce regional industry champions has contributed to overcapacity and inefficiency.
JAC, China’s 11th largest local automaker by group sales, makes a range of commercial vehicles including pickup trucks and heavy duty trucks. It also produces vehicles for electric car maker NIO Inc, one of Tesla Inc’s rivals in China. — Reuters"

Late last year, the company got a US$3bil funding from SoftBank Group Corp and other major investors at a valuation of US$75bil, cementing its position as the world’s biggest privately backed startup.
TikTok and Douyin are two of the fastest-growing apps in the world, and rely on users recording clips typically set to music.
The TikTok app has been installed more than one billion times via the App Store and Google Play, according to Sensor Tower.
The deal is also a rare case of a young startup winning a loan of this size from Asia’s syndicated loan market, where banks are typically more comfortable with lending to mature brick-and-mortar companies.
Other top-tier lenders for the syndicated loan include Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and UBS Group AG, the people said. China Everbright Bank Co and China Merchants Bank Co also joined.
The owner of Chinese news aggregator Toutiao offered an interest margin of 280 basis points on top of the London interbank offered rate for its debut syndicated loan, the people added. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/the-us100bil-man-aramco-ceo-delivers-recordbreaking-bond/,The US$100bil man: Aramco CEO delivers record-breaking bond,Investment,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"LONDON: When Amin Nasser met investors at the palatial St. Regis hotel in midtown Manhattan last week, the chief executive officer of the world’s biggest oil company had one clear message: we’re in a league of our own.
After a bruising two years of being buffeted by delays to an initial public offering, investor skepticism over the valuation and profound change within Saudi Arabia, the CEO was here to set Wall Street straight: “Saudi Aramco is no ordinary oil company,” the 60-year-old petroleum engineer told his audience, according to a person who was present.
A week later, it’s clear the bankers believed him. Aramco sold US$12bil of bonds yesterday in what was one of the most oversubscribed offerings in history. In an incredibly rare turn, demand was so high that the company was able to borrow at a lower yield than its sovereign parent. More importantly, the sale demonstrated Saudi Arabia’s return to the global capitalist fold after being ostracised over the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi last year.
For Nasser, the bond sale is the apotheosis of his career, all the more remarkable because the revelations it brought would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. After decades of secrecy, Aramco has in quick succession revealed its balance sheet, the status of oil fields and the financial relationship with the government, its only shareholder.
“Aramco executives have a strong reputation, they are straight shooters,” said Jim Krane, an energy research fellow at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston. “If they say they are going to do something, they do it.” Aramco, which pumps about one in every 10 oil barrels globally, isn’t just the world’s most profitable company, easily outpacing American titans such as Apple Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, it’s also the cash cow sustaining the entire kingdom.
Even with that track record, the task of selling debt was daunting. For the first time in four decades, the company would be answerable to someone other than the government.
While Aramco was already regarded as a well-run company, comparable to any international competitor, the search for bond investors required a whole new public vocabulary as officials for the first time answered questions on balance sheets and cash flows.
To accomplish the transition, Nasser surrounded himself with a small team of executives, all of whom went from anonymity to Wall Street A-list within a week.
Among them was Khalid Dabbagh, who became chief financial officer only a year ago, and Motassim al-Ma’Ashouq, the treasurer who led the preparations for Aramco’s now delayed IPO. 
Both handled most of the global roadshow, according to people familiar with the presentations, who asked not to be identified because the meetings were private. Other senior managers such as Yasser Mufti, the head of strategy, also pitched in.
Collectively, they delivered what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presumably wanted: a blockbuster deal, attracting almost US$100bil in orders, that was so sought after it actually reduced overall borrowing costs for the kingdom. 
The company’s profile combined with investors’ hunt for yield in emerging markets made the bond offering irresistible for many, said Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. In an era of diminishing or negative yields, Aramco’s longest-dated bonds received the strongest demand. — Bloomberg"

Profit for the latest 12 months was ahead of expectations and the company said it’s on track to reach its goal of an operating margin of 3.5% to 4% in the current year. The results offer another sign that Tesco is emerging from years under the shadow of a massive accounting scandal. The shares were up as much as 1.3%  early yesterday in London.
In what it described as an “uncertain market”, where other retailers are suffering from Brexit-related jitters and the rise of online shopping, the supermarket operator is using its scale to keep a lid on costs. Tesco announced in January that it would close some of its fresh-food counters, affecting as many as 9,000 employees in the United Kingdom.
“Some of the decisions taken to strengthen the business have been difficult but they’ve been the right ones to ensure that we stay focused on the customer while making the business more sustainable,” chief executive officer Dave Lewis said on a call.
As rival J Sainsbury Plc awaits the outcome of a regulatory review of its planned purchase of Walmart Inc’s Asda, Tesco is already reaping benefits from its purchase of wholesaler Booker last year. The new unit boosted operating profit by £196mil (US$256mil) for the latest 12 months.
Overall comparable sales for the fourth quarter rose 1.7% in the United Kingdom, just below analysts’ estimate of 1.8%. Although Tesco’s UK business performed well, it’s struggling in central Europe and Asia, where comparable sales declined for the year. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/fund-management-wrestles-with-a-us72bil-question/,Fund management wrestles with a US$7.2bil question,Markets,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"SHARES of European asset managers have rebounded this year from their disastrous 2018 amid hopes that a rally in global stock markets will persuade clients to stop withdrawing money.
But the gain posted by leader of the pack is driven as much by speculation about its future ownership as any improvement in the financial environment.
DWS Group GmbH, the asset manager controlled by Deutsche Bank AG, has recouped almost all of last year’s losses, bringing its shares to within touching distance of the €32.50 (US$37) for which they were first sold to the public a year ago. The gains are underpinned by talk that the German lender will offload part of its remaining 78% stake to fund its long-mooted merger with Commerzbank AG.
Last month, my colleagues at Bloomberg News reported that German insurer Allianz SE might consider including DWS in its fund management business, which includes bond market powerhouse Pacific Investment Management Co. Last week, they added UBS Group AG to the list of potential suitors, writing that the Swiss bank might combine DWS with its fund business and spin the two off as a separate entity.
But there’s a third candidate that might prove a more strategically compelling purchaser: Amundi SA, already Europe’s biggest asset manager.
Asked last month about a potential acquisition of DWS, Valerie Baudson, a member of the fund manager’s executive committee, told Handelsblatt that her firm has a “natural role in consolidation” in Europe. The company’s history of growth has been “complemented by successful acquisitions,” she told the German newspaper.
Amundi, which manages more than €1.4 trillion, announced earlier this month that it had completed the integration of Pioneer Investments, the Milan-based fund manager it bought in 2017 to add about €220bil of assets. So it has cleared the decks for another foray into M&A. And with €662bil under management, DWS would be a temptingly large prize.Buying the Frankfurt-based firm would create a European behemoth with almost US$2.4 trillion of assets, allowing Amundi to leapfrog its way up the league table of world’s biggest fund managers. At present, it just scrapes into the top 10; bulking up would put it in about fifth place globally, but it would still be less than half the size of the top two firms: Blackrock Inc, which oversees about US$6 trillion, and Vanguard Group Inc with US$5 trillion.
Interestingly, combining the French and German firms would reduce Amundi’s geographical dependence on Europe, which accounts for 80% of its assets. That’s largely because of DWS’s €180bil of assets in the Americas; but it would come at the cost of shrinking Asia’s current 14% share of total assets.
For Amundi, the key attraction of DWS, though, comes in the fastest-growing sector of the asset management industry: the market for exchange-traded funds.
Amundi manages about €95bil in passive management and smart beta products. It said last month that it aims to double the size of that business by 2023. Buying DWS, Europe’s No. 2 in ETFs with almost €113bil of passive assets, would instantly achieve the French firm’s goal.
“I anticipate that it will be more difficult for this year in terms of net inflows,” Amundi chief executive officer Yves Perrier said in February, shortly after revealing outflows of €6.5bil in the fourth quarter that left funds under management little changed for the year. The Pioneer deal shows Perrier is willing to buy scale. The swift integration of the business without driving up Amundi’s overall cost-income ratio shows he can execute.
The US$7.2bil question – DWS’ current market value – is whether Deutsche Bank really wants or needs to sell the remainder of its stake. If it does, and it’s still a big if, it could finally trigger the wave of consolidation that Europe’s asset management industry has been speculating about for years.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/hard-rock-genting-may-vie-for-control-of-crown/,"Hard Rock, Genting may vie for control of Crown",Investment,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"SYDNEY: Forced to anchor in licensed clusters in Las Vegas and Macau, the world’s biggest casino operators rarely get a free shot at expansion. That’s why a once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy established resorts in Australia could escalate into a bidding war.
Crown Resorts Ltd, controlled by billionaire James Packer – the one-time fiancé of singer Mariah Carey – this week disclosed a A$9.99bil (US$7.12bil) takeover offer from Wynn Resorts Ltd and said the two companies were discussing a deal. 
The talks were short-lived. Wynn said they were revealed too soon and ended negotiations.
The discussions were initially reported in the Australian Financial Review and confirmed shortly later by Crown. It looked like a tried-and-tested play to root out a higher bidder – until Wynn walked away.
But with Crown now known to be on the market, Packer may yet land a deal. After surging 20% on the talks with Wynn, Crown stock retreated just 9.1% when the discussions collapsed. 
With the Wynn talks on hold for now, rival suitors such as Hard Rock International Inc and Malaysia’s Genting Bhd  may engage, according to Deutsche Bank AG.
A representative for Crown, which owns casinos in Melbourne and Perth and is building a third in Sydney, declined to comment on the leaked talks with Wynn or why they broke down so abruptly.
Governments worldwide typically keep a tight grip on new gaming licences, which partly explains why it’s so rare for a casino company to sell up. 
A takeover of Crown at the price proposed by Wynn would be the industry’s biggest acquisition in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg data going back to 2007.
Beyond Wynn, Crown also might be a match for other companies with casino operations in Singapore or Macau because of the potential synergies, said David Bonnet, managing partner at Delta State Holdings Ltd specialising in hospitality and gaming consulting.
“For businesses already operating in the region, it makes sense too to consider the deal,” said Bonnet. “Acquisition is the only way to enter a monopoly-style market.”
Suncity Group Holdings Ltd. has been expanding outside Macau in recent years and is building a casino in Vietnam. The company said it wants to head offshore but Wynn’s offer for Crown was too high.
“We actively keep our eyes on overseas opportunities around the region as the footprint expansion can help create more synergies among our businesses in each gaming hub,” said Andrew Lo, executive director of Suncity.
Genting, with resorts stretching from the United States to Singapore, has experience of the Australian market. In 2012, it owned about 10 percent of Crown’s rival in Australia, Star Entertainment Group Ltd. before a 2017 selldown. A company representative declined to comment.
Hard Rock International, which has casino resorts across North America, is one of the many companies with designs on a casino licence in Japan. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
A corporate retreat by the billionaire Packer has looked more likely since late 2016, when a crackdown in China resulted in 19 current and former Crown staff being convicted of illegally promoting gambling on the mainland, where it is banned. In the same year, he had an ugly public break up with Carey.
Crown is now almost solely focused on its domestic market. Packer quit the board of Crown in March 2018 due to mental health issues and stepped down as a director of his private investment company three months later.
For Wynn, the Crown deal would have represented a chance to catch up to competitors who already have footholds in Asia beyond Macau. 
Unlike Las Vegas Sands Corp, which has a resort in Singapore, or Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd, which has built a “City of Dreams” in Manila, Wynn is currently confined to the Chinese gaming enclave, where expansion is approaching its limit. 
And they’re all fiercely competing for an operating license in Japan, seen as the region’s next gambling goldmine.
Given its need for growth beyond Macau and the few options available, Wynn may yet return to negotiate a deal with the Melbourne-based company, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Vitaly Umansky wrote in a note.
The prospect of Wynn buying Crown, while “perplexing”, may have some merit given the slowdown in Macau, he said. — Bloomberg"

First-quarter listings on European exchanges were the lowest since 2012, raising less than US$1bil, the data show.
Network International is also the first company of scale to list in London this year, a market investors have avoided so far amid concerns around the impact of Britain’s planned exit from the European Union.

At 6 pm, the ringgit finished at 4.1050/1100 against the US dollar from 4.0920/0960 at yesterday's close.

It was the local unit's weakest performance since Jan 30, 2019 when it ended at 4.1050/1100 versus the greenback.

Despite the downward revision on global growth forecast, FXTM global head of currency strategy and market research, Jameel Ahmad, however, noted that the IMF had revised Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019 upwards by 0.1 percentage point, compared with its October forecasts.

""The Malaysian economy is expected to expand 4.7 per cent this year, which would be a repeat of 2018's performance, and it is still higher than the global growth forecast of 3.3 per cent for 2019.

""This speaks to the resilience of Malaysia's domestic economic fundamentals in the face of a broader slowdown for the global economy,"" he told Bernama in an email today.

Jameel said FXTM expected the ringgit to remain supported, even as it adhered to the broader performance by Asian currencies against the greenback.

Yesterday, the IMF trimmed global GDP growth in 2019 to 3.3 per cent from the previous forecast of 3.5 per cent made in January this year.

The airport operator said three international carriers which operate the Boeing 737 MAX to the KL International Airport (KLIA) had switched to other aircraft types after the Ethiopian Air incident on March 10. 
It also said that Indonesian carriers are seen to reduce flight frequencies after the Lion Air crash in October 2018 which is also related to the Boeing 737 MAX. 
""The recent grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX may have further negative impact on Indonesian carriers’ capacity to Malaysia. However, the impact from this may not be significant as most of the Indonesian sectors have competing operators,"" it said in its monthly passenger traffic update. 
Passenger traffic at KLIA in March was little changed at 5.2 million passengers. March 2019 passenger movements for KLIA's main terminal declined by 0.6%, while klia2 increased by 0.6%, it said. 
MAHB said domestic air travel remained busy in the first quarter of this year, with 15 airports across the country recording growth in passenger traffic. 
Growth, according to the airport operator, was driven by additional seat capacity offered by airlines. 
MAHB, which operates all airports in the country except for the Senai Airport in Johor, said passenger movement rose 3.9% in the first quarter ended March 31 (Q1) to 25.4 million travellers. 
""Malaysia's Q1 2019 growth was driven by the domestic sector, partly due to the higher seat capacity offered by airlines to match air travel demand,"" it said. Local airports that registered double-digit growth were Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Melaka, Ipoh, Kuantan, Tawau, Labuan, Bintulu and Sibu. 
MAHB said domestic traffic grew 7.7% in the first quarter, faster compared with the international segment's growth of 0.6%. 
Aircraft movements at local airports grew by 0.7% in Q1 2019 over Q1 2018. International movements declined by 2.1% while domestic sector increased by 2.5% over the same period. 
Total passenger traffic at all airports managed by MAHB, including in Turkey, climbed 3.7% in the first quarter 33.4 million passengers. International traffic registered 3.4% growth with 16.1million passengers while domestic passenger movements increased by 4% with 17.4million passengers. 
""The overall passenger movement of 3.7% growth for the network of airport in Q1 2019 was driven by both international and domestic sector albeit with a different traffic backdrop for Malaysia and Istanbul SGIA,"" MAHB said. 
Moving forward, the future seat capacity filings by airlines remain above expectation and MAHB said it is cautiously optimistic that the projected 4.9% growth for 2019 would be achievable.

The IMF, whose spring meetings with the World Bank begin in Washington this week, noted that the global economic expansion is slowing, and an abrupt downturn could have a far-reaching impact. 
The fund also warned against rolling back prudential regulations that could help to buffer the financial system in the event of a downturn.

""There is a risk that positive investor sentiment could deteriorate abruptly, leading to a sharp tightening of financial conditions,"" the IMF said in its Global Financial Stability Report. ""This will have a larger effect on economies with weaker fundamentals, greater financial vulnerabilities, and less policy space to respond to shocks.""

On Tuesday, the IMF cut its expectations for global growth to its lowest level since 2016. It marked its third downgrade since October. In Wednesday's report, it cautioned a sharper-than-expected slowdown could spur tighter financial conditions.

In Wednesday's report, the IMF urged policymakers to clearly communicate any changes to their monetary policy stances to minimize market swings. Noting investor sentiment had improved since the Federal Reserve paused its rate-hiking cycle, it warned that a strong shift in Fed policy could trigger a sell-off in riskier assets.

The IMF also echoed concerns raised by US officials over rising corporate debt levels, noting corporate sector risks appear elevated in about 70% of systemically important countries.

A rapid tightening of financial conditions could drive a steep economic downturn, as the creditworthiness in the corporate debt market has deteriorated. The stock of lower-rated investment-grade bonds has quadrupled since the 2008 financial crisis, and the stock of speculative-grade credits has nearly doubled.

""The US corporate credit cycle appears to be at its highest point in recent history,"" the IMF said, adding that global earnings growth has ""likely peaked.""

The IMF noted that trading in British and European markets has remained orderly as the authorities struggle to negotiate an orderly British exit deal.

However, it warned that a protracted stalemate threatens to ""unsettle financial markets, damage investors’ confidence, (and) adversely affect business investment.""

Globally, trade-dependent sectors have risen on expectations of a positive outcome for US-China trade talks, the IMF said, but if those talks falter the organization expects a renewed sell-off.

To guard against financial vulnerabilities, the body said policymakers should proactively deploy prudential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer and bank stress testing. In particular, regulators should develop tools to tackle climbing corporate debt from non-bank intermediaries. 
""A rollback of regulatory reforms should be avoided,"" it added."

The common theme with the two investments were that they were done without the approval of Felda’s board of directors, and the involvement of third party companies in the deals, resulting in a breach of confidentiality in both instances.
In the case of the £60mil purchase of the London hotel, the white paper found that no sale purchase agreement had been signed between Felda Investment Corp (FIC) and the original owner of the property (Company H).
This was despite FIC making the full payment of £60mil, with the payments made in two parts, via a law firm it appointed in the UK.
According to FIC records, the agreement used in the purchase of the hotel was an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) between Company H and another company (Company I), at a price of only £46mil.
The forensic study found that Company I was a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company owned by a Malaysian individual.
Among findings related to the case was a weakness in management, with FIC’s former directors and management making several moves without the approval of the board. The purchase of the hotel was also done without the approval of the Felda board.
“There was the involvement of a third party which was not appointed officially by Felda or FIC, in the setting of the terms of acquisition of GPK, which is a breach of confidentiality,” the document read.
The manner in which the deal was done also resulted in losses of £14mil for FIC.
In the case of the acquisition of two real estate units, Dexion 1 and Dexion 2, which were later named Felda House and Grand Felda House, the white paper highlighted eight key findings.
Among these were the fact that FIC failed to appoint experts to conduct due diligence on the exercise, despite its former directors having approved the appointment of the experts.
It also noted that FIC’s board of directors were informed that the cost of the takeover of the two properties was £163mil, when the actual cost was £167.76mil.
This, the document stated, meant that there was an increase in the takeover cost by £4.76mil (RM25mil) compared to the price approved by the FIC board.Related stories:Weak financials a key challengeKL Vertical City project: Poor management by FICNew Felda schemes targeted for settlersFelda impacted by FGV’s poor investmentsFelda to embark on group-wide structural reformWeak management team caused Felda’s downfallWhite paper reveals Felda made several bad investment decisions"

TAMBUN Indah’s land acquisition is seen as a positive move as the market has been anticipating it to replenish its landbank since a few years ago.
The new land, which is adjoined to the southern side of Pearl City, should be an extension to the existing township.
RHB Research conservatively estimated the GDV of the 209.54 acre freehold land at RM1bil, adding that there could be further upside over the longer term.
This will suggest an increase of almost 30% to the group’s GDV for all its remaining projects in the portfolio.
RHB Research said the new land ought to allow the management to better plan its township going forward.
The transaction cost of RM14.35 per sq ft is comparable to the land cost of the existing Pearl City, which means that the gross margin of 30% to 40% should be maintained, which is above industry average.
The research house added that Tambun Indah’s patience for land-banking has paid off as land parcels are now cheaper due to sluggish property market conditions.
Earnings forecasts are maintained as Tambun Indah will likely complete the development on its remaining 420 acres over the next five years.

Higher interest expenses are also forcasted in FY19-20F due to higher working capital requirements.
The research house kept is ASP and sales volume assumptions of RM190/tonne and 6.5 million tonnes for FY19F, reduced FY20F assumptions to RM200/tonne and 7 million tonnes and an assumption of RM210/tonne and 7.4 million tonnes for FY21F.
While the potential revival of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project may seem positive to Lafarge, the impact is rather insignificant.
AmInvestment Bank estimated that the project will require 1 million to 1.3 million tonnes of cement over a construction period of four years, which works out to 300,000 tonnes annually.
This is only 2% of the annual cement consumption in the peninsula.
The forecasts have yet to reflect the additional demand from the project. If factored in, the net losses for FY20-21F will be reduced by RM13mil each.
The research house also said there are speculations that Lafarge’s parent compay LafargeHolcim may be looking to exit Malaysia following the disposal of its Indonesian unit in November last year.
It added that the cement sector in the peninsula will remain challenging over the medium term due to the wide gap between local demand versus installed capacity.
Apart from hefty capacity cost, the absence of pricing power in a glut means players are also unable to pass on higher production cost to end users.

Rating: Hold (maintained)
Fair value: RM1.15

 

THE group’s KPJ Tawakkal hospital expansion is still in early planning stage. If the expansion plan to construct a new block to add 120 beds go through, it will impact the group in the long term, improving its discounted cash flows valuation.
AmInvestment Bank said a quick calculation estimates KPJ’s fair value to increase to RM1.17.
The expansion is also subject to approval by the Health Ministry. If everything goes well, the construction is expected to begin by end-FY19 and completion by end-FY22.
KPJ Tawakkal is currently operating 200 beds and has an occupancy rate at around 70%. It aims to increase its medical tourist patient visits to 15% from 7% currently through medical tourism initiatives and service offerings.
It achieved RM200mil revenue and circa RM20mil profit before tax in FY18. It contributes around 6% and 7.5% to the group’s revenue and profit before tax respectively.
KPJ has a vast network of hospitals nationwide, and is a preferred counter by the research house for its capacity expansions and its positions to benefit from the national health insurance scheme.
The group had just opened KPJ Bandar Dato’ Onn in Johor Baru in February and is expected to open KPJ Miri, KPJ Kuching and KPJ Batu Pahat in 2HFY19.
The research house also believed that at its current share price, the counter is close to full valuation."

In fact, Felda’s board of directors were only notified about the transaction eight months after the deal was done, despite the FIC having found out about the sale much earlier.
According to the document, the board of directors of FIC had agreed, on January 16, 2014, to appoint a property development company (Company F) as the main developer of the Kuala Lumpur Vertical City project.
This was despite FIC having no claim on the land, and the FIC not having been appointed by Felda to handle the project.
The FIC was only officially appointed by Felda seven months later on September 2, 2014. The KL Vertical City was a mixed development project situated on 24 lots of Felda land, and was to be implemented in stages over 10 years from the date of the Development Order (DO).Related stories:Felda impacted by FGV’s poor investmentsFelda to embark on group-wide structural reformWeak management team caused Felda’s downfallWhite paper reveals Felda made several bad investment decisionsIrregularities in Felda’s London investmentsWeak financials a key challengeNew Felda schemes targeted for settlers"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/weak-financials-a-key-challenge/,Weak financials a key challenge,Plantations,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Felda is now faced with the challenge of stabilising its current weak financial position, while pursuing the penerokas’ (settlers) socio-economic development agenda.
Felda’s current business financing model is burdensome to its settlers and has significant financial implications on the group itself, said the White Paper. 
Therefore, a comprehensive improvement plan must be developed to help Felda return to its original role of developing land and taking care of the well-being of its settlers.
Under Felda’s replanting programme, the challenge is on the high replanting loan cost among the settlers.
The White Paper said that the cost of the oil palm and rubber replanting programme for each settler would require significant expenditure - a maximum of RM254,400 for the replanting of oil palm and RM88,000 for the replanting of rubber. 
The cost is first borned by Felda and will be a loan repayable by the settlers within 15 years. In general, the settlers’ real loan after taking into account the replanting and farm produce during the replanting programme is only between RM120,000 and RM150,000, including the loan interest. 
Settlers also have the Sara Hidup (SH) and Pinjaman Pendahuluan Hasil (PDH) loans - eight years for the cultivation of oil palm and six years for rubber cultivation.
The funding for Felda’s operational expenses was initially generated from its internal funds.  But since 2009, Felda has taken up loans from financial institutions at interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.0%. Under the agreement, Felda will charge an interest rate of 6.25% on the settlers’ loans. However, the effective interest rate charged on settlers is only 3.8% and the difference in the interest rate is borne by Felda.  
The Paper said Felda was now unable to make consistent payments for SH and PDH to the settlers due to its critical cash-flow problems.   “The delay in this payment has caused dissatisfaction among the existing settlers and the new generation of Felda settlers.
“Another challenge for Felda is the management of settlers’ land undertaken in clusters with the plantation yields shared with settlers. 
“The issues faced by Felda is when settlers opt to manage their own land and take over the plantation after replanting, and some do not even deliver their plantation yields to the Felda management. 
“This situation has resulted in Felda not being able to make loan deductions through the settlers’ income statement, which further affects Felda’s cash flows,” the report said.
Felda also has to bear the high cost of rehabilitation when settlers resubmit their non-productive land to be re-managed by Felda.  Depending on the condition of the settlers’ land, the rehabilitation cost is  estimated around RM5,000 per ha-RM30,000 per ha.
Other challenges faced by Felda include senior settlers aged between 61 and 79 years old still relying on Felda to finance their replanting and receiving SH/PDH loans, unfinished inheritance deals should the settler die, and Felda’s high old age palm tree profile with decreasing yields. 
Currently, the settlers’ plantation hectarage is about 405,317 ha, of which 69% or 280,451ha comprise of matured areas and  some 8% or 31,956ha are 23 years and above, which need to be replanted. 
The replanting cost for oil palm from 2003 to 2004 was estimated at RM4,500 per ha, and had jumped by over three times to RM14,000 per ha in 2019. Accordingly, the estimated cost, which involves the replanting of old oil palm trees, is about RM450mil for 32,000ha.
On Felda’s new generation housing project, the White Paper said Felda has developed 8,314 units of houses on over 38 project sites at a total development cost of RM1.65bil. Of these, only 1,498 units (18.0%) have been fully completed on eight project sites with 3,296 units (40.0%) on 12 sites having progressed in excess of 70.0%.Related stories:New Felda schemes targeted for settlersKL Vertical City project: Poor management by FICFelda impacted by FGV’s poor investmentsFelda to embark on group-wide structural reformWeak management team caused Felda’s downfallWhite paper reveals Felda made several bad investment decisionsIrregularities in Felda’s London investments"

Efforts to bring more development and progress are also part of the new business model that aims to deal with many of the grouses settlers have had in the past.
In the White Paper on Felda, the government said the agency would introduce a more flexible new aid scheme to settlers to replace the Sara Hidup (SH) and Pinjaman Pendahuluan Hasil (PDH) financing.
Through this new scheme, settlers will receive a loan based on the requirements of the settlers to avoid high indebtedness over a long period of time. The rate of debt repayment for replanting will be determined based on the settlers’ income. At the same time, settlers who have received SH and PDH at a previous rate will be given the option to join this new scheme.
The government will provide various socio-economic programmes and initiatives at Felda areas, including improving the quality of life of the settlers through an increase in the social and physical infrastructure in collaboration with all ministries and government agencies.
Basic facilities and infrastructure such as roads, power supply and broadband that have been provided by Felda will now be addressed by the government. This will open up opportunities for settlers to generate income and improve the economy through various downstream and entrepreneurial industries.
Felda will also step up efforts to reform its land under the scheme to grow more rapidly through the formation of a new city to develop and stimulate economic activities in collaboration with the private sector to create a smart community. 
The report said this would create a holistic and comfortable ecosystem for every settler so they have an alternative source of income. 
Traditional villages around the Felda schemes will also receive a boost to its local economy.
According to the report, Felda will continue to ensure the emphasis on education for the new generation of settlers, including women and youth, so as to be not left out in the tide of progress. They will be equipped with strong knowledge and diverse skills at every level of education to improve job opportunities and promote economic growth. 
This effort will be carried out with professionals consisting of successful settlers’ children acting as mentors and re-contributing to the strengthening of the Felda community.
New schemes to help the settlers’ children’s education via co-operation with government-linked companies and private companies will be introduced with the focus on technical and vocational education.
Felda’s new generation of human capital will continue to be strengthened towards the delivery of a knowledgeable, responsible and capable generation. The new Felda will also produce future leaders who will bring Felda towards excellence.
The Economic Affairs Ministry, in collaboration with Felda and related government agencies, will develop a socio-economic development plan for the settlers community completing the initiative implemented by Felda.
This development plan will also take stock of rural resources and potential, as well as a rapid development process in related areas. The implementation of this plan is expected to address the social problems  among Felda youths, besides providing basic infrastructure and facilities on Felda land.
Felda will complete the abandoned PGBF housing project where progress is at 70.0% and above. 
This will benefit 4,794 new generation of families to own homes. 
At the same time, housing construction businesses in the Felda area will be implemented by related government entities such as Syarikat Perumahan Negara Bhd and others. In addition, Felda will allow a new generation of settlers to build their own homes on the same site as the original settlers. 
The report also said Felda was in the process of updating data on land ownership and that the settlers would finalise the inheritance information. The inheritance plan needs to be done quickly, as  88.0% of settlers are over 56 years of age.Related stories:KL Vertical City project: Poor management by FICFelda impacted by FGV’s poor investmentsFelda to embark on group-wide structural reformWeak management team caused Felda’s downfallWhite paper reveals Felda made several bad investment decisionsIrregularities in Felda’s London investmentsWeak financials a key challenge"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/11/felda-impacted-by-fgvs-poor-investments/,Felda impacted by FGV’s poor investments,Plantations,"Thursday, 11 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The Federal Land Development Authority’s (Felda) financial position deteriorated after the listing of Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd  (FGV), now renamed as FGV Holdings Bhd, in June 2012.
The White Paper issued yesterday showed the loss-making Felda’s income was impacted, as FGV was unable to contribute an estimated income of RM800mil a year as expected before the initial public offering (IPO).
Felda was impacted by the losses and impairments in FGV and also the latter’s investment of RM1.6bil in PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk (EHP), including foreign-exchange losses in 2017.
The report stated that FGV’s several other decisions had a negative impact on it.
Among the decisions were the acquisition of assets exceeding market prices such as Pontian United Plantations Bhd  (RM1.2bil), Asia Plantations Ltd (RM628mil) and four plantation companies and a piece of oil palm land and assets in Sabah from Golden Land Bhd  (RM655mil). 
“The land lease agreement (LLA) did not provide the returns as projected when FGV was listed. Instead, it had a negative impact on Felda’s financial position,” said the report.
FGV was listed in June 2012 at an issue price of RM4.55. A total of RM10.5bil was raised from the listing exercise, of which Felda received RM6bil and FGV the remaining RM4.5bil.
However, since the listing, Felda’s financial position has worsened as it posted losses of RM2bil in 2013 compared with a profit of RM5.8bil in 2012.
Felda’s net losses were RM1bil in 2014, RM1.1bil (2015), RM700mil (2016) and this worsened to RM4.9bil in 2017.
Felda also saw its cash pile of RM1.8bil and RM3.9bil between 2007 and 2011 shrinking to RM400mil in 2017.
Its net losses of RM4.9bil in 2017 were due to the deterioration in plantation income due to the negative impact from the LLA and also the purchase of non-strategic assets and investments which were above market price and poor governance.
The government-linked company also faced rising expenditure costs. 
Over 2007 to 2017, its cumulative financing to settlers and contributions to the state government totaled RM13.1bil, while staff management costs came to RM2.7bil.
Total expenditure rose sharply during the period following the special grant amounting to RM1.7bil to settlers in 2012. Additionally, there was an impairment of investments in FGV amounting to RM2.1bil and fair-value losses on investments in EHP of RM1.6bil, including foreign currency exchange losses in 2017.
The increase in finance costs was due to high levels of loans taken from external institutions. 
Felda’s gearing ratio rose to 1.2 times in 2017, an increase of 114 times. For example, a loan from GovCo Holdings Bhd amounting to RM2.3bil was used to purchase a 37% stake in EHP’s shares, which was higher than the market price. 
In the same year of purchase, the value of EHP shares had fallen by RM1.6bil, including foreign-exchange losses.
The report said Felda’s investments in EHP were classified as “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” instead of “investment in associate”. 
If this investment had been properly classified, the decrease in the fair value of EHP would have been reported as an investment impairment of RM1.6bil, and the fair value of the put option should have been considered. 
While Felda’s total assets increased by 107% from RM12.1bil in 2007 to RM25bil, its liabilities surged by 1,100% from RM1.2bil to RM14.4bil. 
Revenue fell by 74% from RM2.7bil to RM700mil. Its profits fell from RM1bil in 2007 to net losses of RM4.9bil in 2017. 
The report said the long-term trend showed that although Felda’s total assets had increased during the period, this did not translate into higher revenue or income for Felda.
The report pointed out that the audited financial statements for the financial years ending 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2017 found that the asset value did not include impairments and this was not in line with recognised accounting standards. 
“If adjustments are made to impairment, the assets’ value will be lower than reported for each year. This assessment is limited to forensic research on eight investments or selected asset purchases. If this investigation is extended, it is likely that other errors can be detected,” it said.
The report also showed that Felda’s cash balance had shrunk from RM2.4bil in 2007 to RM400mil in 2017. Prior to FGV’s IPO, Felda’s financial performance was strong, with an average cash balance of RM2.5bil a year.
The cash balance had declined dramatically after the loss of income from plantation activities and lower returns on investment. 
The report cautioned that the current method or strategy would impact the sustainability of Felda, where it would have to continue to borrow to cover its expenses and it would not be able to continue to operate.
FGV was established in 2007 as an overseas investment vehicle in the palm oil business as well as other agricultural businesses.
When it was started, Felda channeled RM1.8bil for financing FGV’s business operations. Of this, FGV spent RM1.7bil on financing foreign investments through the purchase of shares and property.

Hektar Asset Management Sdn Bhd executive director and CEO Datuk Hisham Othman declined to divulge further, but reiterated that the Reit’s strategy is to own geographically diverse malls that are yield accretive.

“This strategy has been proven well, and the future malls that we acquire will most likely be situated outside the Klang Valley, which are saturated with overbuilt malls or retail assets.

“We like malls that are market leaders in their locality, being the number one or only mall in town.

“We are looking at several malls to see which assets would meet our criteria,” he said.

Hektar Reit considers retail properties with yields of 6% to 7% to be acceptable.

Apart from that, Hektar Reit takes into consideration the percentage of ownership, land title status and tenure of the retail assets it looks to acquire.

The Reit is on track to double its assets value to RM2.4bil by 2026.

At present, there are six shopping centres with two million square feet of retail space, valued at RM1.2bil under the portfolio, catering to a market catchment of three million shoppers.

Executive director Emeritus Professor Dr Zakariah Abdul Rashid said this is due to the slowdown in the global, as well as domestic demand.

He said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected the world’s economy to grow at 3.3 per cent in 2019, in contrast to 3.6 per cent last year.

“There are growing risks to the global growth tilted towards the downside, predominantly due to factors related to trade policy uncertainties and the weakening financial market sentiments,” he told reporters after MIER’s 24th Corporate Economic Briefing here today.

Zakariah said mounting trade tensions together with other emerging concerns, such as slower-than-expected growth in emerging economies, were causing instability in the financial market.

He said weaker economic growth in China due to the trade tensions with the US had contiguous effects on many world economies, including Malaysia.

Zakariah said the country’s net export was expected to further contract to 3.4 per cent from a contraction of 1.4 per cent in 2018, and with the backdrop of slower global growth, the Malaysian economy would have to heavily rely on domestic demand to steer growth.

However, he said domestic demand was expected to grow at a slower pace resulting from lackadaisical growth in both consumption and investment demand.

“The slowdown in private investment is due to a moderation in global investment flow and reduced demand for manufacturing goods,” he said.

Zakariah said the government was expected to enhance fiscal stimulus to boost growth, as easy money will intensify capital reversal due to monetary policy normalisation among developed economies and mitigate capital outflows.

He said capital outflows would exert a downward pressure on the value of the ringgit which in turn, would negatively influence domestic production and consumption.

“International reserves of Bank Negara decreased last year as the ringgit was under downward pressure.

“Nevertheless, reserves have been rising for this year, after declining four quarters in a row, indicating that the ringgit is strengthening,” he said.

Commenting on the outlook for commodities, Zakariah said the global outlook is mixed for the year.

He said demand for agriculture commodities, particularly crude palm oil (CPO), is expected to improve due to an increase in volume coupled with better prices.

“The price of CPO is expected to touch RM2,700 a tonne this year,  compared with last year’s average price of RM2,232 a tonne,” he said, adding that this was mainly due to the increase in demand for biodiesel and a weaker ringgit.

Meanwhile, Zakariah said demand for petroleum products is bleak amid slower global growth.

The rising crude oil prices after bottoming out at the end of last year was mostly due to supply disruptions despite weak demand, he said.

“The short run price is expected to touch mid-US$70 per barrel in the first half of this year before falling back into the upper US$60s per barrel in the second half of 2019,” he added. - Bernama"

The shares fell 5 percent in premarket activity on Tradegate after the country’s biggest carrier disclosed late Monday an adjusted loss before interest and taxes of 336 million euros ($380 million). 

The downturn, which compared with earnings of 52 million euros a year earlier, was particularly stark because of strong results for the beginning of last year following the collapse of Air Berlin, Lufthansa said in a statement late Monday. 

The loss comes after Lufthansa opted to pare planned capacity increases this summer to bolster fare prices and focus on profitability. The European airline industry is coming off a tough year, with bad weather and air-traffic-control strikes among the factors hurting profit. 

Irish low-cost giant Ryanair Holdings Plc has warned that depressed fares will continue for the rest of the year.

Lufthansa’s fuel bill rose by 202 million euros in the first quarter, in line with a company forecast for increases of 200 million euros in each of the first three quarters. 

The full-year rise is expected to be 650 million euros, the airline said in a presentation last month.

The carrier still expects to report annual adjusted EBIT margin of between 6.5 percent and 8 percent, the carrier said.

The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index is down 14 percent from a record in May 2018 and it’s the worst major market in the world so far this year, having slipped 3.5 percent. 

That’s even amid a rally in global equities spurred by the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot and a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China. 

The gloomy outlook for Malaysian stocks isn’t likely to end anytime soon, says Samsung Asset Management Co.

“Malaysia will likely disappoint over the next year because since the new government came in power in May 2018, it has been lowering public debt with fiscal tightening,” said Alan Richardson, a regional fund manager at Samsung Asset in Hong Kong. 

“This will be the theme from May 2018 to May 2020.”

Euphoria about Malaysian stocks has faded after almost one year since Mahathir Mohamad’s surprise election victory in May, as the new administration struggled to clean up government inefficiencies and corruption. Unfulfilled campaign promises partly due to the legacy it inherited have also hurt its popularity. 

The new administration last month lowered its 2019 economic growth forecast and has been on an austerity drive to rein in its budget deficit.

‘Oil fallacy’
The KLCI stocks gauge fell to its lowest since 2016 last week even as the price of crude oil, one of its major exports, has risen by a third in 2019. The Malaysian stocks index was little changed at the midday break on Tuesday.

”The perception that Malaysia is the only beneficiary in Asia from rising oil prices is a fallacy,” Richardson said. “Rising oil price is negative for Malaysia” because it imports more oil products than what it exports as crude, he said.

Foreign investors have dumped Malaysian shares worth more than a net $500 million so far in 2019, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. 

Malaysia’s central bank in March pledged to keep monetary policy accommodative as global risks weigh on the trade-reliant economy.

Not everyone is bearish. Bharat Joshi, a Jakarta-based fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is “neutral” on Malaysia stocks and sees green shoots in infrastructure and oil-related stocks. 

Construction shares and oil and gas stocks will outperform the market following the resumption of talks on projects including the East Coast Rail Link and a rebound in commodity prices, he said.

However, Joshi and Richardson shared a view that the weak performance of the new government and companies have weighed on sentiment so far.

Richardson said he is bearish on Malaysia stocks not because there is a downside risk, but “just that there is nothing to be positive about over the next 12 months.” - Bloomberg"

“With that, we will (then) be able to fine tune the alignment, location of stations and financing packages,” he told Bernama during his recent visit to the national news agency's headquarters here.

A state-initiated project, the PTMP is expected to cost an estimated RM46 billion.

It features an undersea tunnel linking the island to the mainland, highways, LRT and monorail, and an extensive bus connectivity on both the island and mainland.

SRS Consortium is a joint venture between Gamuda Bhd , Loh Phoy Yen Holdings Sdn Bhd and Ideal Property Development Sdn Bhd as the project delivery partner for the PTMP and the South Reclamation Scheme.

The proposed projects in the first phase of the PTMP include the Pan Island Link 1 (PIL1) highway, the Bayan Lepas light rail transit system, and works involving several major roads.

The state government obtained a conditional approval (PIL1) from the Department of Environment (DOE) on April 10 after it reviewed the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on the project.

Meanwhile, the rail line for the LRT project will cover 29.5 kilometres and 27 stations, running from Komtar to the Penang International Airport and to the three future reclaimed islands in the south of Penang, estimated to cost RM8 billion.

Chow said the LRT project would take between six to eight years to be completed and a public display will be held for three months to gather feedback from the public on it.

“The project delivery partner will assist the state government in implementing the project, secure the approval, get funding and deliver it according to the time frame, quality and cost.

“There should not be any overrun in terms of cost, time and other things,” he added. - Bernama"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/mier-sees-economy-growing-4pt5pct-this-year/,MIER sees economy growing 4.5% this year,Economy,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",3:50 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) has forecast Malaysia's 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) to post a moderate growth of 4.5 per cent compared with 4.7 per cent last year.

Executive director Emeritus Professor Dr Zakariah Abdul Rashid said this is due to the slowdown in the global, as well as domestic demand.

He said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected the world's economy to grow at 3.3 per cent in 2019, in contrast to 3.6 per cent last year.

“There are growing risks to the global growth tilted towards the downside, predominantly due to factors related to trade policy uncertainties and the weakening financial market sentiments,” he told reporters after MIER's 24th Corporate Economic Briefing here on Tuesday.

Zakariah said mounting trade tensions together with other emerging concerns, such as slower-than-expected growth in emerging economies, were causing instability in the financial market.

He said weaker economic growth in China due to the trade tensions with the US had contiguous effects on many world economies, including Malaysia.

Zakariah said the country's net export was expected to further contract to 3.4 per cent from a contraction of 1.4 per cent in 2018, and with the backdrop of slower global growth, the Malaysian economy would have to heavily rely on domestic demand to steer growth.

However, he said domestic demand was expected to grow at a slower pace resulting from lackadaisical growth in both consumption and investment demand.

“The slowdown in private investment is due to a moderation in global investment flow and reduced demand for manufacturing goods,” he said.

Zakariah said the government was expected to enhance fiscal stimulus to boost growth, as easy money will intensify capital reversal due to monetary policy normalisation among developed economies and mitigate capital outflows.

He said capital outflows would exert a downward pressure on the value of the ringgit which in turn, would negatively influence domestic production and consumption.

“International reserves of Bank Negara decreased last year as the ringgit was under downward pressure.

“Nevertheless, reserves have been rising for this year, after declining four quarters in a row, indicating that the ringgit is strengthening,” he said.

Commenting on the outlook for commodities, Zakariah said the global outlook is mixed for the year.

He said demand for agriculture commodities, particularly crude palm oil (CPO), is expected to improve due to an increase in volume coupled with better prices.

“The price of CPO is expected to touch RM2,700 a tonne this year,  compared with last year's average price of RM2,232 a tonne,” he said, adding that this was mainly due to the increase in demand for biodiesel and a weaker ringgit.

Meanwhile, Zakariah said demand for petroleum products is bleak amid slower global growth.

The rising crude oil prices after bottoming out at the end of last year was mostly due to supply disruptions despite weak demand, he said.

“The short run price is expected to touch mid-US$70 per barrel in the first half of this year before falling back into the upper US$60s per barrel in the second half of 2019,” he added. - Bernama"

It hit an early intra-day low of 4.1315 to the greenback.

Bloomberg quoted Mizuho Bank Ltd as saying the ringgit’s decline was driven by concern that FTSE Russell may drop Malaysian bonds from its global index, with falling oil prices also weighing on the currency.

The ringgit was also weighed down by headlines from former PM Datuk Najib Razak’s trial relating to state fund 1MDB and Malaysia’s dispute with the European Union over palm oil, according to  Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho in Singapore.

“So really, it is a conspiracy of the bears for the ringgit at this moment,” Varathan was quoted saying by Bloomberg.
 Earlier, Stephen Innes, managing partner and head of trading SPI Asset Management, said the ringgit caught an updraft on China TSF data while banks loans also came in much higher than expected so there could be upside revaluations to China’s GDP forecasts for 2019. 

""I still think the China stimulus will take a while to filter through to the Malaysia economy and the ringgit could remain vulnerable to a shift in Bank Negara policy,"" he said."

The funds add to a massive pool of money for Chinese investment and underscore investor confidence in the ability to cut deals in the world's second-largest economy in the face of economic slowdown and trade tension with the United States.

DCP in a statement on Tuesday said it raised over $2 billion for its DCP Capital Partner I dollar fund from investors, known as limited partners. The fund was ""significantly"" oversubscribed due to strong demand from investors such as pension funds, funds-of-funds and sovereign wealth funds, it said.

Along with a concurrently raised yuan-denominated fund, committed capital reached about $2.5 billion, putting DCP among several China-focused investment managers that have funds in both U.S. and Chinese currencies.

China-focused private equity and venture capital managers raised $37 billion last year in dollar-denominated funds, versus $40 billion in 2017, according to data provider Preqin. Asia-focused dry powder - money committed but not yet invested - was a record $291 billion at the end of 2018.

DCP's investors include Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and state investor Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd , as well as Canadian public pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ), said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, declining to be identified as the matter was private.

DCP declined to comment on the investors.

The Hong Kong and Beijing-based private equity firm said it will primarily seek buyout and significant minority investment opportunities in sectors that benefit from consumption upgrade and industry consolidation in Greater China, such as consumer, industrial technology and healthcare.

DCP was set up in 2017 by Liu who was also a co-head of KKR's Asia private equity business, and Julian Wolhardt, a former senior KKR executive in the region after both worked with the U.S. buyout firm for 11 years. Prior to KKR, Liu and Wolhardt led Morgan Stanley's private equity business in Asia.

Both had led investments for KKR including in raw milk producer China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd, home appliance maker Haier Electronics Group Co Ltd and leasing firm Far East Horizon Ltd.

DCP has invested about 30 percent of the capital raised in six firms mainly in China, including COFCO Meat, a unit of state-owned grain-to-real estate conglomerate COFCO, domestic medical device firm Venus Medtech, and Singapore-based electronic component maker MFS Technology, said the person. - Reuters"

The predictions from executives including the head of Mitsubishi Motors on the first day of the Shanghai Autoshow point to a vehicle market that is heading for more balanced growth, especially if the trade war with the U.S. is resolved.

Automotive sales in China contracted for the first time last year since the 1990s as a slowing economy and the trade friction between Beijing and Washington affected consumer sentiment.

Recent moves by the Chinese government to cut taxes, carmakers' plans for new model launches as well as the hopes that the U.S.-China trade spat will soon be resolved could start to turn things around, the executives said.

""We predict there will be negative growth in the first half this year, even double digit,"" said Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd's (GAC) general manager Feng Xingya.

""But due to government subsidies, carmakers' discounts and better macroeconomic conditions, sales will turn to positive in the second half,"" he said.

The decline in Chinese automotive sales has already started to slow. They fell by 5.2 percent in March, the smallest decline since August 2018.

""It's only natural for the China market to transition to slower growth,"" Mitsubishi Motors' Chief Executive Osamu Masuko told Reuters in an interview, saying that the market was showing some ""level of maturity.""

""Going forward the market still has more growth left in it, but it will likely grow moderately. Growth of 5-6 percent a year on a consistent basis might not be that easy to achieve.""

UNEVEN GROWTH

The opening day of the autoshow was marked by launches of new sports utility vehicles from carmakers such as General Motors Co and Daimler, aimed at rejuvenating customer interest with fresh designs in the fast-growing market segment.

Some firms were more optimistic with luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce Motor Cars saying that it would likely achieve double digit sales-growth in China again this year, although below 2018 levels.

But others predicted that more pressure is to come as Beijing institutes tough rules to transform the industry which could kick off a round of consolidation or prompt some to leave the Chinese market.

""That's more likely to happen to small, non state-owned players who really don't have a whole lot to offer,"" said GM's China President Matt Tsien, adding that it could extend to some foreign players.

The government has this year tightened the screw on makers' ability to add manufacturing capacity and is instituting electric car production quotas for automakers to combat pollution.

""But I don't believe the number is going to be significant, Tsien said. ""Because at the end of the day this is still one of the most attractive markets in the world. And everybody wants to be here."" - Reuters"

The first sign of trouble came when Chinese 10-year Treasury futures for June delivery, the most-traded contract, fell as much as 0.7 percent in initial deals on Monday.

While they recovered slightly by Tuesday afternoon, they were still down 0.6 percent from Friday's closing price.

The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds has risen more than 7 basis points so far this week, according to Refinitiv data, the latest stage of a rout that has pushed the yield up around 33 basis points since the end of March.

At 3.40 percent, the 10-year yield has now retraced to levels last seen in December.

The latest selling pressure came after robust March credit data on Friday raised hopes that China's economy may be starting to stabilise.

Hit by a multi-year financial deleveraging campaign and the trade war with the United States, China's economic growth slowed to a near 30-year low of 6.6 percent in 2018.

Data due on Wednesday is expected to show the weakest first-quarter economic expansion in at least 27 years.

But March readings to be released at the same time (0200 GMT) are expected to show faster growth in industrial output, investment and retail sales, suggesting a flurry of policy support measures in recent months are starting to kick in.

""The stronger-than-expected credit expansion together with a rebound (in the) inflation reading reinforced market concerns that China may put easing monetary policy on hold,"" said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China Research at OCBC Bank in Singapore.

China's campaign to shore up slowing growth has seen it roll out billions of dollars worth of additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending this year.

That fiscal stimulus has been accompanied by five cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) over the past year as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) worked to encourage lending and reduce borrowing costs for small and private firms.

Economists polled by Reuters before Friday's credit data had expected three more RRR cuts this year in the current quarter and the next two, in line with previous surveys. Many had pencilled in the next cut for this month, though Xie said after the strong lending data that there was no urgency to roll out more measures at the moment.

A summary of a quarterly meeting of the central bank's monetary policy committee published late on Monday suggested a more cautious approach.

The PBOC said it would maintain control of money supply ""floodgates"", a term absent from the previous quarter's statement.

""When the central bank reiterates risk prevention, the easing cycle of monetary policy might be ending,"" said Qu Qing, chief economist at Jianghai Securities.

The policy signal conveyed by the PBOC meeting suggested that tightening is on the way, and a near-term reduction in reserve requirement ratio (RRRs) or interest rates is unlikely, he said.

Nomura said in a note on Tuesday that there is much less room for easing and stimulus in China this time because of surging debt, but added it would be too early to start withdrawing easing measures as a sustainable recovery is still in question.

Still, expectations of tightening pushed benchmark five-year interest rate swaps (IRS) up to a high of 3.25 percent on Tuesday, up from 3.12 percent at last week's close.

Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac in Singapore, also cautioned that any signs of a bottoming out in the economy were ""preliminary"".

""At this junction, policymakers would not want to suffocate growth and would not like to see funding costs materially higher,"" she said.

However, some traders and market watchers said that liquidity conditions were likely to tighten in mid-April as companies make first-quarter tax payments, boosting demand for cash and sucking funds out of the market.

Such liquidity concerns earlier this month had prompted some analysts to predict an imminent cut to banks' reserve requirements.

Iris Pang, an economist at ING in Hong Kong, said she maintains her expectation for an RRR cut this month.

""As trade war uncertainties linger on, there is a need to keep the fast yuan loan growth to help small private firms survive. An RRR cut is needed to facilitate fast credit growth,"" Pang said in a note.

""China may not need such fast ongoing credit injection into small private firms. That said, we believe that the central government will allow speedy credit growth to continue for some time, at least until it is satisfied that the job market is stable.""

Investors looking for indications of a policy shift will be closely watching the PBOC's actions when medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans with a value of 366.5 billion yuan ($54.65 billion) expire on Wednesday.

A total of 1.1855 trillion yuan worth of the loans is due to mature in the second quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on official data. - Reuters"

It said on Tuesday it had activated its NB-IoT network in these selected areas which were within the key IoT market centres.

NB-IoT, a dedicated network for IoT technology, brings 5G-like capabilities albeit for lower bandwidth applications.

Maxis said NB-IoT can support millions of connected things which consumes very low power and therefore lends itself to delivering a long battery life. 

The technology will power up Big Data and enable advanced data analytics to help make decisions in areas such as potential cost savings, improved efficiency and new business opportunities. 

“As part of the launch, Maxis will also offer NB-IoT solutions and promote the development of the local ecosystem through sharing of global best practices and the curation of best in breed solutions.

“Businesses will now be able to deploy industrial IoT applications to form new data streams, enabling actionable insights by connecting simple devices such as sensors,” it said.

To bring this project to life,  Maxis, as Vodafone’s preferred IoT partner in Malaysia, will be leveraging its existing collaboration with the company by having access to its global experience in NB-IoT deployment across multiple countries. 

Using Vodafone’s market leading platform, Maxis will be able to deliver a market-proven technology for businesses in Malaysia looking to implement NB-IoT services in their operations. 

Paul McManus, head of enterprise, Maxis said there was an immense amount of opportunities for NB-IoT especially around big data analytics and in enabling real life use cases. 

“The launch will encourage the development of an ecosystem of partners, developers and customers that will offer even more opportunities for enterprises, to better manage and optimise their assets, their environment, their energy usage and the safety of their people, and to unlock the potential for the delivery of new services in the Malaysian market. This is a significant step for us as it sets the standards in the deployment of IoT solutions,” he said. 

Maxis NB-IoT is currently being piloted in several industries for multiple industry leading use cases that will enable improved efficiency and possible new business models. These include smart metering and environmental monitoring. 

There are also solutions in Maxis IoT Innovation Lab that include smartlighting, parking monitoring, smoke alarms and more. 

They have the potential to open up new possibilities for key stakeholders such as government, state councils and Malaysian businesses in the areas of agriculture, utilities and Smart Cities, to name a few."

To pay for the acquisition, Handal will issue 42.86 million new shares at 37 sen each, as well as 26.06 million irredeemable convertible  preference shares (ICPS) also at 37 sen each.
""The proposed acquisition will allow Handal to immediately expand its service offerings to its existing clients due to the similar business nature of both Handal and BSOE which is in the provision of maintenance services for the upstream oil and gas sector,"" Handal said.
To date, BSOE’s total outstanding orderbook stands at RM215.4mil derived from contracts awarded by oil majors such as Petronas and Shell, which provides earnings visibility for the next 3 years.
In addition, BSOE also secured a maintenance, construction and modification service contract via an unincorporated joint venture with Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd to maintain 49 platforms off Sarawak with an estimated contract value of RM800mil.
Handal said BSOE has been generating profits for the past two years up to the audited financial year ended June 30, 2018.
The proposed acquisition comes with a profit guarantee of RM5mil, of which RM2.55mil is attributed to Handal based on its 51% equity interest."

Output of rare earths oxides (REO) in the quarter ending March 31 was 5,444 tonnes, compared with 4,110 tonnes produced lasta year.

Production of NdPr, or neodymium-praseodymium, rose 19.4 percent to 1,591 tonnes, a new quarterly record, said Lynas, the world's only major producer of rare earths outside China.

The record came despite a slower start up in January, with more than 600 tonnes produced in the month of March, it said.

Third-quarter sales revenue rose nearly 18 percent to A$101.3 million.

Lynas added that in a move to combat continued weakness in market prices, it would reserve all NdPr product for its strategic business partners, which could lead to a build-up in inventory in the fourth quarter.

Lynas, which operates an $800 million processing plant in Malaysia, has been locked in a dispute with the Southeast Asian nation on waste disposal after it was told to remove years of accumulated waste at the facility in order to have its licence renewed.

Wesfarmers last month approached Lynas with a A$1.5 billion ($1.08 billion) takeover offer.

They bought $19.91 billion in Treasuries in February, marking their first net purchase in four months. In January, they sold $11.99 billion, the latest Treasury data showed.

Treasury yields fell most of February on uneasiness about U.S.-China trade friction and disappointing economic data. But they rose later that month on selling linked to $168 billion of government debt supply and a reading on fourth-quarter gross domestic product that turned out to be not as dismal as some traders feared.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell over 0.07 percentage point to 2.71% at the end of February. In late Monday trading, they were 2.554%.

""At first pass, this indicates ongoing interest despite lower outright rate levels. It's also notable that, outside the Treasury market, overseas demand for U.S. fixed income was evident in agency and corporate debt, as well,"" BMO Capital Markets interest rates strategist Jon Hill wrote in a research note.

Overseas accounts acquired $22.48 billion in agency debt and $10.68 billion in corporate bonds in February.

Foreigners, on the other hand, shunned U.S. stocks for 10 straight months, selling $10.67 billion in February following $31.21 billion in sales the month before.

Chinese holdings of Treasuries, meanwhile, increased in January for a third straight month to $1.131 trillion, the highest level since October.

The world's second-largest economy remained the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt.

Japan also raised its stakes in Treasuries to $1.072 trillion in February, its highest level since November 2017.

U.S. Treasuries holdings in the United Kingdom rose to $283.8 billion, up from $273.5 billion the prior month.

CIMB Research retained its target price of 26 sen which was about half of the last traded price of 53 sen.

Prestariang SKIN Sdn Bhd had sued the government for its unilateral termination of the Sistem Kawalan Imigresen Nasional (SKIN) project by way of expropriation. The sum payable is calculated based on the contractual formula provided in the concession agreement (CA) which had been agreed to by the government.   

Both parties had earlier engaged in a few rounds of negotiations after the government cancelled the SKIN project but were unable to reach an amicable settlement on the quantum. 

As a last resort, the board of Prestariang had to file the suit. In its legal claim, PSKIN highlighted that the concession agreement clearly spells out the government’s obligations in the event that the SKIN project is unilaterally terminated by way of expropriation. 

“Prestariang indicated that PSKIN has never defaulted on the concession agreement,” it said.  

“The RM732.8mil compensation that PSKIN is seeking is much higher than our RM520mil estimate, i.e. the net present value (NPV) of the availability charges (similar to power purchase agreements).  

“However, we do not have the finer details of the concession agreement. At RM732.8mil, compensation to Prestariang (Prestariang owns a 70% stake in PSKIN) is RM513mil or RM1.06 per Prestariang share.  This would be 46 sen above its current share price.

It said on Tuesday the new southern alignment will provide a direct link from Kuantan Port to Port Klang. 

The research house pointed out the southern alignment aims to leverage on the existing KLIA Express Rail Link (ERL) and the upcoming MRT SSP Line’s (MRT2) interchange in Putrajaya Sentral, thus, underpinning passenger/ridership viability, which was in question previously.

CIMB Research said a positive surprise from the revised ECRL was the increased benefits to local contractors, in the form of a higher 40% of total civil works exposure, compared to 30% based on the original deal. 

“Working on the revised RM44bil construction cost, the potential share of works for local players amounts to RM17.6bil. Project completion is delayed from 2024 to 2026,” it said.

The roll-out of potential new tenders for local contractors as a result of the realignment will take some time, based on its checks, as this would hinge on the completion of the new railway scheme design, public display of the new alignment and finalisation of land acquisition, likely over the next six months. 

“The ECRL news is overall positive to mitigate the downturn of contracts. However, we retain our sector Underweight call given the average 43% run-up in share prices of rail contractors ahead of the ECRL’s revival. Upside risk is a stronger momentum of new ECRL tenders and the review of other deferred rail contracts from 2018,” it said.

The revised ECRL will have 20 stations – Kota Baru and Tok Bali in Kelantan, Kampung Raja, Kuala Terengganu, Pengkalan Berangan, Dungun, Kemasik and Chukai in Terengganu while in Pahang, the train will make stops in Cherating, Kuantan Port City, Kuantan Port City 2, Kota SAS, Gambang, Maran and Mentakab.

Aside from Putrajaya, the ECRL will also have stations in Jelebu in Negri Sembilan, Bangi/Kajang and Port Klang and another proposed station in Selangor.

The travelling time from Kota Baru to the Klang Valley is expected to be about four hours, which is significantly shorter compared to the average seven hours by road.

The project, which now costs RM44bil after renegotiation, would have a new targeted completion date of Dec 31, 2026. This is an extension of two and a half years from the original completion date of June 20, 2024.

The construction cost managed to be brought down by RM22bil, which is almost a third of the original cost of RM66bil.

On April 12, Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd and China Communications Construction Company Ltd signed a supplementary agreement to pave the way for the resumption of the suspended project."

The People’s Bank of China said it’ll keep good control of the money supply “floodgate” and not “flood” the economy with excessive liquidity, according to a statement released late Monday. 

That wording had been dropped from the previous quarter’s report, and its return signals increasing restraint in liquidity management as the economy improves.

China’s “economy has shown healthy development and economic growth is resilient,” with improvement in both market expectations and financial support for the economy, according to the statement from the first-quarter meeting of the monetary policy committee, which was held on April 12.

While repeating the need for continuous counter-cyclical measures, the bank said it’ll “keep strategic focus,” a phrase often seen when officials want to avoid large-scale stimulus. 

The bank also said it’ll push forward market-oriented interest rates reform, keep credit growth in line with the pace of nominal gross domestic product and promote both inbound and outbound opening up of the financial sector.

Credit growth surged and exports rebounded in March, pointing to a firmer recovery in the economy after policy makers’ strengthened stimulus in the second half of last year. 

Weaker global demand and uncertainties about the course of trade talks with the U.S. are likely holding back a more pronounced bottoming-out.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/oils-rally-faces-odds-of-demand-worsening-before-getting-better/,Oil's rally faces odds of demand worsening before getting better,Oil & Gas,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",11:24 AM MYT,"SINGAPORE: Oil’s march back toward a four-year high is now facing some roadblocks in the form of demand in Asia, though the path may clear to allow further gains later this year.

While the current rally in global benchmark prices to over $71 a barrel will put pressure on government finances in Asia’s import-dependent nations, the level of fiscal stress typically doesn’t determine their crude purchases.

 Instead, the volume of shipments is influenced by the state of demand for fuel from industries and consumers in the world’s biggest oil-consuming region.

In a discouraging sign for oil bulls, some indicators of consumption such as diesel profit margins have shown signs of weakness recently. That may hamper crude’s rally, which has so far been driven by OPEC’s output cuts and concerns over tight supplies. Still, market watchers see the effect as temporary, and predict fuel demand will rebound later in 2019.

“Demand for crude in Asia and other regions is directly dependent upon downstream fuel margins,” said Tushar Tarun Bansal, trading and downstream expert at McKinsey &amp; Co. “In the near term, what we’re observing are weak margins and higher-than-usual planned refinery maintenance in Asia,” said Singapore-based Bansal.

The following charts show the state of fuel markets in Asia and the outlook for the coming months.

Crude Influence

The effect of fuel margins on purchasing patterns was illustrated in China last year. Asia’s biggest crude importer received record foreign supplies near the end of 2018, a result of purchase decisions made about 60 days earlier when Asian refining profits were near their highest level for the year.

The nation’s largest-ever oil haul came shortly after Brent futures topped $86 a barrel. In the following months, the country’s imports fell, even as crude slipped into a bear market, coinciding with a drop in returns from making fuel.

The profit from turning crude into fuels in Asia slumped to $2.75 a barrel, the lowest in over two years, in January after averaging almost $6 in the second half of 2018, according to data compiled from Oil Analytics Ltd., a firm that tracks hundreds of refining margins worldwide. While this so-called crack spread has since recovered to nearly $5, it’s still well below November levels.

Current Lift

The recovery in overall fuel margins from their January low has been supported by gasoline, demand for which has been boosted by everything from massive campaigning activity ahead of Indian and Indonesian elections to government efforts to lift voter sentiment.

Moreover, unplanned refinery outages at American plants and falling U.S. inventories also boosted margins for the fuel at a time when Asian facilities are shutting for annual spring maintenance. 

All that’s helped returns from making gasoline surge to a profit from a loss in January. The fuel is now at a premium of about $7 a barrel over Brent crude, compared with a discount of over $2 in late January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Diesel Dream

Meanwhile, concerns over global growth and the impact of the trade war between the U.S. and China -- the world’s two biggest economies -- are weighing on margins for diesel, according to industry consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. Still, profits from making the fuel, which is used in factories and trucks, are set to rebound in coming months.

That’s because tankers across the globe will probably switch to cleaner diesel from more-sulfurous fuel oil in the run up to the implementation of stricter ship-emission standards mandated by the International Maritime Organization from the start of 2020.

“The longer diesel margins stay low -- which reduces the incentive to maximize production now -- the more likely crack spreads will explode in the fourth quarter,” said Nevyn Nah, head of east of Suez products at Energy Aspects. “Markets need to be patient” to see the spike, the Singapore-based analyst said.

Fuel Shift

Industry consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. sees higher gasoil returns in 2020 as demand for low-sulfur fuels climb on the back of new environmental regulations. The company estimates diesel will widen to a premium of $19 a barrel to Brent crude. The spread’s currently at about $12.50, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Several recent developments are raising optimism that concerns over global economic growth may be overdone. Keys gauges of factory strength in China and the U.S. strengthened in March, and the two countries seem to be inching closer to a trade deal, and the Federal Reserve hit pause on interest-rate hikes as other central banks delivered stimulus. That could support returns from making fuels such as diesel.

The International Energy Agency cut its growth forecast for global refinery operating rates for this year by 400,000 barrels a day, reflecting “unfavorable crude market fundamentals,” according to the group’s monthly Oil Market Report. 

In the fourth quarter of 2019, however, run rates are expected to rise by 1.2 million barrels daily versus the same period a year earlier as new refinery projects start. - Bloomberg"

As of Monday, Zhang Yong, chairman of Haidilao International Holding Ltd., and his wife Shu Ping, had grown $6 billion richer in 2019, a 79 percent jump in just over three months.

That pace is the fastest in Asia and globally only topped by Australian mining baron Andrew Forrest, who has doubled his fortune this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, a ranking of the world’s 500 richest people.

Haidilao went public in September, and it’s been a lucrative time for China’s largest hotpot chain, popular for the spicy broths in which diners cook their meats and vegetables.

 The company is pushing to make its restaurants more efficient by creating automated kitchens. Perks like the free manicures it offers waiting customers have kept families coming in. And the brand is expanding overseas with new locations planned in New York and London.

Last year, revenue surged 60 percent to 17 billion yuan ($2.6 billion), and that’s helping to push the stock up more than 75 percent this year. At about $21 billion, the company’s market value is now higher than Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.

”A good set of results has resulted in the stock rallying to new highs,” said Tristan D’Aboville, an analyst at William O’Neil & Co., pointing to increases in sales growth and new restaurants added in the second half of last year.


Customers dine at a Haidilao hotpot restaurant, operated by Sichuan Haidilao Catering Co., in Shanghai, China, on Sunday, July 9, 2017. Billionaire Zhang Yong runs the nation's most popular chain of restaurants that serves up boiling soup broth with meat, seafood, vegetables, and noodles. 
Another power couple behind Haidilao, co-founder and executive director Shi Yonghong and his wife Li Haiyan, have also grown 79 percent wealthier this year, based on Monday’s data. Their fortune is now worth $6.4 billion.

Still, the enthusiasm for Haidilao’s stock has made it increasingly expensive. Recently valued at about 47 times projected earnings for the next 12 months, it’s around four times more expensive than Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

China’s increasingly competitive hotpot market is projected to grow at a compounded annual rate of more than 10 percent, with revenue topping 700 billion yuan by 2022, according to consultancy Frost & Sullivan.

Besides small, privately owned restaurants, there are other competing brands like the publicly listed Xiabuxiabu Catering Management China Holdings. Haidilao has a less than 3 percent share of the Chinese hotpot market, according to its September prospectus.

In an October interview, Haidilao’s chief strategy officer, Zhou Zhaocheng, said the company sees room to grow by offering customers diverse choices, better service and by creating new experiences for them.

So far it has kept Chinese consumers loyal by making their visits more fun. Its outlets provide free board games, shoe-polishing and manicure services for those waiting. Diners can watch a Sichuan Opera show or even a noodle dance where staffers twirl lengthy ribbons of noodle.

In October last year, one of Haidilao’s restaurants began introducing robots to take orders, and deliver raw meat and vegetables to customers to cook in the simmering pots of soups placed at their tables.

Zhang, a former welder at a tractor factory, founded Haidilao with friends in 1994. It went public last year.

He and his wife, both Singaporean citizens, now had a net worth of $13.6 billion as of Monday. That includes their holdings in Haidilao’s seasonings and sauce arm, Yihai International Holding Ltd., which has seen its shares rise more than 90 percent this year. The couple holds about 58 percent of Haidilao.

Now, Haidilao and other Chinese hotpot brands are attempting to expand overseas. Little Sheep, a hotpot chain owned by Yum China Holdings Inc., opened its first overseas branch in Los Angeles in 2003.

”With the rise in Chinese outbound tourism and growing appreciation for China’s hotpot culture, we are excited about accelerating the expansion of Little Sheep globally,” Joey Wat, the chief executive officer of Yum China, said in November.

Little Sheep now has over 60 restaurants worldwide. That gives it a greater overseas presence than Haidilao, which had 36 stores outside China at the end of last year.

“Haidilao was able to cut through the clutter of various Chinese hotpot operators through their exceptional service,” said Jack Chuang, a partner at OC&;C Strategy Consultants. “Whether Western customers will embrace hotpot â“ it is a big open question.” - Bloomberg"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/barclays-recommends-buying-three-faang-stocks-ahead-of-results/,Barclays recommends buying three FAANG stocks ahead of results,Markets,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",12:25 PM MYT,"NEW YORK: The FAANG stocks have already seen double-digit gains so far this year, but one analyst expects the rally to continue for at least three of the five companies, with their upcoming quarterly results seen as the primary positive catalyst.

The mega-cap group of Internet and technology stocks -- comprised of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc., and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. -- are all scheduled to report by the end of April, and Barclays recommends adding to positions in Facebook, Amazon, and Alphabet ahead of their results.

All five companies have outperformed the broader market this year, though they remain below record levels hit in 2018, before concerns over valuation and their growth prospects spurred heavy selling. 

While those issues haven’t disappeared, and growth stocks are at their priciest level relative to value names since the dot-com era, Barclays’ analyst Ross Sandler expects the results to help investors move past them.

Barclays “would add to positions” in both Facebook and Alphabet ahead of their results, and recommended “taking advantage and adding selectively” to Amazon before the e-commerce company’s print, the firm wrote to clients on Monday.

For Facebook, Sandler wrote that the results could provide a key boost to investor sentiment following a variety of controversies in 2018, affirming his overweight rating and $210 price target.

“The investment community is skeptical around core FB’s user growth and engagement, so any color around stable-to-improving user trends should go a long way toward improving the narrative,” he wrote.  Internal checks point to “another strong quarter,” although one that likely wouldn’t result in as much upside as the social media company’s fourth quarter.

Facebook is up nearly 37 percent in 2019, more than twice the almost 16 percent rise of the S&amp;P 500. At current levels, it remains 18 percent below a record hit in July. Facebook reports after the market closes on April 24.

Amazon reports the day after Facebook, and while Barclays expects its quarter to be “mixed,” Sandler wrote that “unlike the last two prints sentiment is already bracing for this.” Barclays has an overweight rating and $1,930 price target on Amazon.

Stepping back, he added, “investors rarely get a chance to buy AMZN at 19x Ebitda,” or when it is notably below recent highs.

Amazon is currently about 10 percent below records, despite having risen 37 percent off a December low.

For Alphabet, Sandler said the company could benefit from improving margins. The current margin picture, “reminds us very much of the set up in early 2015, whereby Google operating margins went from imploding to stable, which set the stage for a 40 percent+ move higher for shares.”

He doesn’t expect any 2019 rally to be “that dramatic,” but writes, “we’d expect some upside from here.” He noted that mobile advertising revenue “remains strong,” and that any headwind from YouTube content issues were “not material.” 

Sandler affirmed Barclays overweight rating and $1,350 price target on Alphabet.

Alphabet is scheduled to report results on April 29. Shares have risen 17 percent year to date. 

Barclays’ Monday note didn’t include any commentary on Netflix or Apple, the other two FAANG stocks, though over at Buckingham, analyst Matthew Harrigan wrote that he “would be opportunistic” on any weakness in Netflix after its results.

According to a UOB KayHian report, the Pengerang Terminal Phase 2 (PT2SB), which has 1.3 million cubic metres dedicated to the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development’s requirements, is expected to complete all commissioning phases by the middle of the year.
As such, the JV profits will have strong growth, as these new growth projects are to contribute immediately in the first quarter of the financial year ending June 30, 2020 (1Q20).
Apart from that, new growth projects in Langsat 3 and Pengerang Phase 1E are near completion for full start-up by 1Q20.
The new 100,000-cubic-metre storage capacity for Langsat 3 terminal is at 80% completion, while another 200,000 cubic metres are still open for negotiations. 
The Pengerang Phase 1E expansion  (430,000 cubic metres), meanwhile, is undergoing commissioning and is at 80% completion for the targeted start-up from the second half of 2019. 
However, revenue is expected to decline in financial year 2019 (FY19) due to the completion of PT2SB’s RM5.5bil engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) in December last year, a significant EPCC project for the group. Additionally, Dialog is still executing the EPCC for several other projects, including the Pengerang Phase 1E expansion.
“In tandem with its normal business model, these projects will transition from EPCC to recurring income from the fabrication and maintenance phases (O&M) for downstream projects, which has been growing at 10% to 15% per annum. 
“Nevertheless, management has hinted that the maintenance income is not sufficient to offset the drop in EPCC profits in the near term. 
“Overall, we project an almost flattish year-on-year (y-o-y) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation growth, given that the EPCC shortfall will be adequately covered by maintenance income and the full consolidation of the Langsat terminal earnings into revenue since mid-1Q18,” said UOB KayHian.The research house’s new profit forecasts assume a y-o-y growth of 17%, 19% and 11%, respectively, as compared to Dialog’s guidance for a 10% to 15% growth. 
This is mainly due to UOB KayHian’s upgrade to JV earnings as Phase 2’s take-of-pay earnings will not be materially impacted by the resized capacity to 1.3 million cubic metres. 
In comparison, Dialog’s first-half FY19 and FY18 core earnings recorded a y-o-y growth of 24% and 31%, respectively. 
“We believe these growth rates are achievable due to the on-schedule commissioning of the JV projects, which will significantly drive group earnings growth in the near term. 
“This is slightly offset by our lower FY19 revenue forecast, from RM3.1bil to RM2.8bil, due to EPCC, until Dialog secures offtakers for Pengerang Phase 3,” said UOB KayHian.
The research house projects revenue to recover by FY21, as it expects Dialog to secure new EPCC projects and potential fabrication-related works for O&G decommissioning demand across the region."

Rating: Add
Target Price: RM6.50
CIMB Research is maintaining its add recommendation for RHB Bank following the bank’s base-rate hike of 10 basis points to 4% as  the interest income earned will be raised from its loan portfolio. 
According to the research house, this move does not come as a surprise as three other banks have also raised their base rate (BR) hikes, including Bank Islam to 4.03%, CIMB Bank (4.25%), and Hong Leong Bank (4.13%) respectively. 
CIMB Research estimates the 10-basis point hike would increase RHB Bank’s net profit by around 5% and net interest margin (NIM) by seven basis points for financial years 2020 earnings forecast (FY20F) and FY21F. 
“The expected increase of around 5% in RHB Bank’s FY20F and FY21F net profit will be able to offset our estimated reduction in FY20-21F net profit of around 5% in the event of a reduction in overnight policy rate later this year,” it said.
However, CIMB Research said RHB Bank increased the BR due to the increase in cost of funds and not because of the negative impact of any expected rate cut, adding that the bank expects interest rates to remain unchanged in this year’s forecast. 
The research house raises RHB Bank’s earnings per share forecasts by 4% for FY19 forecast as it factors in the 10 basis points hike in the BR.  As such, CIMB Research said it would boost RHB Bank’s dividend discounted model-based target price from RM6.38 to RM6.50. 
“RHB Bank remains an add and our top pick for the sector given its attractive valuation at calendar year 2020 forecast (CY20F) price to earnings ratio of 8.1 times  and price to book ratio of 0.8 times as well as improvements from the transformation programme. 
“A potential re-rating catalyst is the higher net profit as a result of the BR hike. The downside risks to our call are deterioration in loan growth and asset quality,” it added.

Rating: Hold
Target Price: RM2.55
AllianceDBS Research is keeping its hold call on Lafarge Malaysia with a target price of RM2.55, pending further details of the revival of East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project as the RM270mil contract suspension is likely to be lifted. 
In March 2018, Lafarge Malaysia bagged a contract worth RM270mil from China Communications Construction (ECRL) Sdn Bhd to supply cement for all eight packages of work for the proposed ECRL project. However, the contract was suspended since July last year. 
AllianceDBS Research said the contract suspension is likely to be lifted instead of being re-tendered given that the main contractor is still China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC). 
“As the cost reduction only resulted in a minimal cut in rail length alignment of around 6% (from 688km to 640km), we think the RM270mil contract amount might remain the same or if any, see an insignificant cut,” it added. 
Should the RM270mil contract remains unchanged, AllianceDBS Research expects the cement demand to be around RM1.2mil metric tonnes (MT) over the next four years, corresponding to 300,000 tonnes per year.
“This is relatively small compared to Lafarge’s effective capacity of 8.2 million tonnes. As such, we think that more infrastructure projects are needed to support demand.”
With the lower revised cost of RM44bil of ECRL Project, AllianceDBS Research believes this to be a “small win” for Lafarge and positive for the cement industry due to the possibility of contract suspension to be lifted as well as potential revival of mega projects would boost demand.

AmBank Research is maintaining its buy call on Sapura Energy with a fair value of 50 sen per share on the back of the company winning five separate contracts worth RM1.3bil which would support its financial year 2020 forecast (FY20F) growth.
The five secured contracts included charter extension from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for semi tender assisted drilling rig Sapura Berani to drill nine wells, three-year charter for tender assist drilling rig Sapura T-9 from Exxonmobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc and  installation of six subsea pipelines over 57km in the Morgan field at Gulf of Suez. 
“Other bagged contracts include construction of pipeline, in-line Tee (ILT), deep water Pipeline End Terminations (PLETs) & pre-commissioning activities from ENI East Sepinggan Limited as well as submarine rescue services by Phoenix International Australia Pty Ltd for The Royal Australian Navy,” AmBank Research pointed out. 
Overall, all these contracts are expected to commence this year and are likely to be finished in both FY19 and FY20. 
“These new contracts for FY20F are in line and account for 19% of our new order assumption of RM8bil, which remains conservative versus RM9.3bil of new jobs secured n FY19. Hence, we maintain FY20F–FY22F earnings,” AmBank Research noted. 
The research house expects the secured contracts to add 8% to Sapura’s outstanding order book to RM18.5bil, which is 3.4 times of FY20F revenue.  AmBank Research said the outstanding order book was expected to grow as the group’s tenders have escalated 3.5 times year-on-year to US$11bil, driven by new markets in the Middle East and Africa accounting for 56% of the bid book. Currently, the stock is trading at a low FY21F price-to-earnings ratio of 14 times and price-to-book value ratio of 0.4 times.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/in-quest-for-electric-supercars-engineers-head-to-startups/,"In quest for electric supercars, engineers head to startups",Business News,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"FRANKFURT: Rene-Christopher Wollmann, head of Mercedes-AMG’s €2.75mil Project One supercar programme, has moved to a job at Automobili Pininfarina in a sign that innovation in high end electric sportscars is shifting toward small startups.
Wollman’s move, which has not been made public, comes at a time when big carmakers, like Volkswagen and Mercedes , have been blindsided by stricter and costly emissions tests, forcing them to focus resources on mainstream electric models and on cleaning up their combustion engines.
Meanwhile, advances in virtual engineering allow even small teams of engineers to develop roadworthy vehicles using software to design, engineer and test prototypes. 
This dynamic has already helped Tesla and China’s Nio steal a march on much larger rivals in the premium electric sportscar segment.
“Large companies take time to transform. And I am good at hypercars. I just did Project One, and now this opportunity came,” 37-year-old Wollmann told Reuters about his reason for joining Automobili Pininfarina, a Munich-based electric carmaker that launched last year.
Project One, which has a modified Formula One engine, was due to go on sale this year but has been delayed by problems getting road worthiness certification following the introduction of WLTP emissions test standards, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Premium or high-performance electric sports cars are equivalent to the Ferraris and Lamborghinis of the conventional auto world.
These so-called supercars can cost anything from about US$100,000 up into the millions of dollars and include Tesla’s upcoming Roadster Founder Series, which will sell for over US$200,000 and the Rimac Concept Two, priced in the region of US$2mil.
The emerging role of start-ups in the development of the premium electric market harks back to an era over a century ago when talented engineers like Gottlieb Daimler and Ferdinand Porsche were able to launch sportscar brands on modest budgets.
Players leading the way include the likes of Automobili Pininfarina, Croatia’s Rimac, China’s Nio and Italian engineering shop Italy’s Maniffatura Automobili Torino (MAT).
But because of the high initial investment needed, with no guarantee of success in a niche market, boutique supercar manufacturers face significant risks if they try to develop more than one vehicle or shift to becoming mainstream carmakers.
Wollmann was hired because he also helped develop an electric version of the AMG SLS for AMG Mercedes, a skill that will help Automobili Pininfarina, owned by India’s Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, develop its own zero-emissions vehicle.
“I did the first electric hypercar for AMG so this was the perfect fit,” he said.
Since its 2018 launch, Automobili Pininfarina has hired a raft of top-flight German engineers. Christian Jung, Porsche’s chief engineer of E-Mobility systems, and Peter Tutzer, a former technical director at supercar brand Bugatti, are part of the team.
They are designing the “Battista”, an electric supercar with a top speed of at least 300 km an hour and acceleration from 0 to 100 in under two seconds. Around 150 will be built, costing two million pounds each, the company said.
“Rene Wollmann came to us because he said it was difficult to realise projects like these at a large company,” Michael Perschke, Automobili Pininfarina’s chief executive told Reuters.
Another startup electric carmaker, Rimac, will provide the Battista’s electric motor and battery pack.
Rimac has built up expertise in high-performance electric vehicle powertrain and battery systems. 
It already has 500 developers in Croatia and made an electric sportscar capable of speeds of 400 km an hour.
Its expertise led Porsche to take a 10 percent stake in the carmaker last year.
“Powertrains with 700 kilowatts of capacity are a niche product. Porsche focuses on the high volume stuff. 
“They don’t have the capacity to deal with every niche,” 31-year-old company founder Mate Rimac told Reuters.
There are two ways to make battery-driven vehicles: to use a clean-sheet design like Tesla, or to take a conventional vehicle platform that can also accommodate an electric version. For now, Daimler and VW have taken the latter approach, building electric cars on the same assembly line as their conventional vehicles, allowing them to scale up production without having to build dedicated electric car factories. — Reuters"

Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings said in a regulatory filing that it had signed a sales agreement with Saudi Aramco that included an option for Aramco to buy an additional 2.9% stake in Hyundai Oilbank.
In late January, Hyundai Heavy said Aramco planned to invest up to US$1.6bil for as much as 19.9% in the South Korean refiner to expand its foothold in the country.
Aramco bought the stake in the unlisted refiner for 33,000 won per share, which is slightly lower than its initially planned price, reflecting market conditions, said an official at Hyundai Heavy who provided no further details.

It was only the third mega deal out of China since the heady days of 2016, when US$239bil of foreign purchases were announced. The fact that EDP-Energias de Portugal SA was being pursued by Three Gorges, a state-owned firm, was taken as a sign that Beijing would bless selective strategic deals while reining in inexperienced companies’ more frothy purchases.
Fast forward nearly a year, and things aren’t looking as rosy. Three Gorges is now planning to scale back the EDP offer and is evaluating smaller alternative transactions amid concerns about political hurdles and valuation, people familiar with the matter said last week. It also didn’t help that the Chinese government changed Three Gorges’s senior leadership while the deal was ongoing.
The pullback threatens to further dampen sentiment at a time when the region’s investment bankers are already feeling the pinch from slower deal activity. Acquisitions by Asia Pacific companies have fallen 30% this year, while fundraising from equity offerings on exchanges in the region has dropped 48% to the lowest level in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Three Gorges is now exploring potential deals that would face less regulatory opposition while still boosting its exposure to EDP’s international operations, the people said. Investments or joint ventures involving EDP’s Brazilian assets are among the possibilities being considered, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. —  Bloomberg"

Terry Gou, speaking on the sidelines of an event here, said that while he planned to resign as chairman, he hoped to remain involved in strategic decisions regarding the company’s business.
When asked by Reuters if he would quit as chairman, Gou said he was moving in that direction, although any decision needed to be discussed with the company’s board.
“I dont know where you got the information from. But I have to say, basically, I’m working towards that direction – to walk back to the second line, or retire ... I have been busy for 45 years. I should hand it over to young people,” Gou said.
“I will be involved in the major direction of the company, but not involved in daily operation.
“I’m already 69 years old. I can pass down my 45 years of experience. That’s the goal I set up – to let young people learn sooner and take over sooner and to replace my position sooner.”Gou said his plans would be discussed with the board of Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, in the coming months.
“Initially, we will tell the shareholders in the AGM in June. In the board meeting in between April and May we will give the new list of board members to the board,” Gou said.
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Lu Sung-Ching, the chairman of Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd, the electronic and optoelectronic connectors unit of Foxconn, was among the possible candidates to take over from Guo.
“It doesn’t mean he will just be gone. 
“He will remove himself to the second line and he would not be involved in the daily operations,” the source said.
Foxconn’s shares rose after the news and closed 3.2% higher yesterday.
Founded in 1974, the Foxconn group has grown to become the world’s biggest contract manufacturer with T$5.2 trillion (US$168.52bil) in annual revenue, assembling goods for Apple, SoftBank Group Corp and other global tech firms.
Last month, Foxconn reported a smaller than expected fall in quarterly profit, despite warning signs from key customers including Apple that demand for tech electronics was softening.
The news comes three months after Reuters reported Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a US$10bil Wisconsin campus.  — Reuters"

Korea’s Asiana Airlines puts entire stake up for sale,Airlines,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"SEOUL: The top shareholder of South Korea’s second-largest carrier, Asiana Airlines, says it will sell its entire stake in the debt-ridden firm to keep it afloat, sending shares of the carrier and its budget arm 30% higher.
The move caps weeks of financial uncertainty involving the carrier which started last month when it failed to win auditors’ sign-off on its 2018 financial statements, triggering warnings of credit ratings downgrades and the resignation of the parent group’s chairman.
Its shares have since more than doubled, as its top shareholder Kumho Industrial pledged to sell the airline should it fail to reduce the airline’s debt, raising expectations for potential takeover interest.
The restructuring plan, however, was rejected by creditors last week for not being sufficient to restore market trust in the indebted carrier, which has 3.4 trillion won (US$3bil) in short-term obligations including 1.3 trillion won of loans maturing this year.
In a revamped proposal yesterday, Kumho, which owns one-third of Asiana, said it would sell the entire stake and also offer the 500 billion won holding as collateral to creditors for interim loans.
“This is going to be a hot deal, as many local conglomerates want to get into the airline business so there are expectations over a coveted takeover deal,” said Lee Han-joon, an analyst at KTB Investment Securities.
Choi Go-woon, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, said several conglomerates or a consortium of firms involved with duty free shop businesses might be interested in Asiana.
He said telecoms-to-chemicals conglomerate SK Group and retail-focused Aekyung Group, which also has budget carrier Jeju Air, could be potential suitors.
Representatives for SK Group and Jeju Air denied any interest in buying the Asiana stake.
Shares in Asiana were up by the daily limit of 30% at their highest in more than three years. Local media earlier reported that Kumho had decided to sell a one-third stake in the carrier.
Shares in Asiana’s low-budget carrier affiliate Air Busan also surged 30%.
Asiana has been struggling to get its finances in order as it battles rising fuel costs and competition from low-cost carriers.
Kumho Industrial has yet to pick a sale manager. Its shares also jumped 30% yesterday.
Officials from Kumho Asiana Group and creditors have been negotiating a fresh restructuring plan since the initial proposal was turned down, two officials from a main creditor told Reuters.
State-run Korea Development Bank, the main creditor of Kumho Asiana group, said creditors would hold a meeting to review the revised plan.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/publicis-to-buy-epsilon-for-us44bil/,Publicis to buy Epsilon for US$4.4bil,Business News,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"LONDON: Publicis Groupe SA will pay US$4.4bil in cash to acquire Alliance Data Systems Corp’s marketing unit Epsilon, as the French advertising group seeks to deepen its digital expertise and expand in the US.
The takeover, the biggest ever for Publicis, was announced by the Paris-based company in a statement on Sunday, two weeks after it confirmed it was in talks with Alliance Data. Publicis shares rose as much as 4.4% to 49.26 in early Paris trading.
The owner of agencies Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett Worldwide is focusing more on data analytics as sales from traditional advertising drop with consumer giants relying less on TV commercials and billboards and shifting spending online.
Epsilon runs loyalty programmes and email marketing and collects data including transactions, location and web activity.
Clients are facing mounting challenges in a “data-led and digital-first world,” Publicis chief executive officer Arthur Sadoun said in an interview. 
He said Epsilon will bring “an acceleration in data and platform that will position us as a clear leader in personalised experience at scale.”
Traditional marketing firms like Publicis and WPP Plc are now up against consultants focused on business transformation including Accenture Plc, which is also getting into creative work. 
At the same time, tech giants Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google threaten to cut out agencies as buyers of ad space.
Shares of Publicis, the third-largest ad holding company by market value, have fallen 13% over the past year. The stock dropped after the company was named as a potential bidder for Epsilon, as investors questioned its ability to absorb such a big transaction.
Publicis said the acquisition would be fully financed by debt and cash on hand and it would suspend a share buyback program to keep a 45% dividend payout ratio pledge. 
The net purchase price will be US$3.95bil after an acquisition-related tax impact, Publicis said.
Analysts from Morgan Stanley and Liberum highlighted benefits of the Epsilon deal in research notes yesterday, including that it gives Publicis more consumer data, but noted the decline in traditional advertising sales for the company in the first quarter.
In a separate statement on Sunday, Publicis said it posted a 1.6% drop in first-quarter organic revenue, after selling its PHS pharmaceutical unit. 
The company said the decline reflects the loss of a handful of consumer goods clients.
What Bloomberg Intelligence says: “Organic growth in net sales is the primary measure of success, and one where Publicis’ progress is in reverse, making the 2020 goal of 4% growth increasingly aspirational.” – Matthew Bloxham, media analyst.
While Sadoun is staking the company’s future on digital tech businesses that he sees as “strategic game changers, Publicis has a patchy record in managing acquired companies. The group posted a loss in 2016 after writing down the value of one of its digital businesses.Under Sadoun’s predecessor as CEO, Publicis supervisory board chairman Maurice Levy, the company made one of the industry’s boldest bets on ad technology in 2015 with the US$3.7bil purchase of Boston-based Sapient. 
On Sunday, Sadoun called the Sapient and Epsilon businesses complimentary.
“Sapient is about business transformation and consulting. Epsilon is about platforms, data and technology to enrich first-party data,” he said.
Plano, Texas-based Alliance Data said in February it was weighing preliminary offers for Epsilon after announcing a review in November. In addition to the Publicis offer, Alliance Data had attracted bids from Advent International and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, people familiar with the matter said last month. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/all-aboard-treasure-on-the-high-seas-for-gas-dealers/,All aboard! Treasure on the high seas for gas dealers,Business News,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"LONDON: In the booming market for super-cooled natural gas, the most precious commodity is the ship.
A global quest for cleaner energy has fired up demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), which produces less carbon dioxide than coal. But an abundance of supply has helped keep prices subdued, meaning the most profitable trade is in renting out vessels to transport it.
Reflecting the white-hot demand for ships, over a dozen different companies, including energy majors BP and ExxonMobil, trading house Trafigura and gas utility Centrica are already looking to charter boats for the winter, according to four shipping industry sources, months earlier than usual.
ExxonMobil, Centrica and Trafigura declined to comment. BP did not respond to requests for comment.
Energy firms are trying to avoid getting stuck without ships on charter for the winter, when cold weather typically drives up trade in LNG and, consequently, transport costs. They also want to profit off less nimble rivals.
Last winter, spot charter rates - the cost of renting a ship to transport LNG in real-time – soared to almost US$200,000 per day in November compared to around US$40,000 in May, squeezing those companies which had left it too late to secure vessels cheaply.
Currently, spot rates are around US$40,000 per day while rates for charters covering next winter are between US$70,000-US$80,000 a day, two shipping industry sources said.
Energy groups including Shell, BP, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Cheniere and Gazprom, utilities Naturgy and Centrica and trading firms such as Gunvor and Trafigura are renting vessels for months or years and sub-letting some of them to competitors, according to half a dozen sources.
None of the firms would comment.
The market for LNG freight trade is relatively new and many companies are reluctant to talk about trading strategies, which are still being developed.
“We see LNG shipping as a commodity on its own,” said Niels Fenzl, vice-president transportation and terminals at Uniper, an energy firm which along with Shell, pioneered freight trade within the LNG market.
“We were one of the first companies who started to trade LNG vessels around two or three years ago and we see more companies are considering trading LNG freight now.”
The market for LNG has exploded in the last few years as countries, in particular China, look to reduce their reliance on coal. Technological developments have also enabled the United States to unlock cheap, abundant shale gas supplies. Starting from scratch, the United States has become the world’s fourth-largest exporter of LNG in three years.
Shell predicts that the volume of LNG traded will rise 11% this year to 354 million tonnes. Five years ago, it was 239 million, according to the International Group of LNG Importers.
The increased trade has, however, resulted in thinner margins between different regions, meaning less opportunity to profit on spreads between LNG prices around the globe.
Last winter, the average premium of Asian prices over Europe was around US$1 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). In the winter of 2011-2012 it averaged US$7.3 per mmBtu, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.
Nearly 50 LNG ships were launched last year, bringing the total fleet to around 550, but with LNG supply growing quickly and seasonal peaks, the margins on LNG shipping rates can be eye-popping.
Last year, Cheniere made deals in spring and summer for more than 10 vessels to cover its winter positions. Some ships were chartered at around US$70,000 a day and rented out in winter at around US$90,000 a day, an industry source said. That trade has become a sector legend and sources said others were trying to replicate it this year.
“Big portfolio players, like Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and Cheniere, are looking at keeping their ships busy all the time, optimising their positions with their own or third party cargoes to make sure they can squeeze every dollar from their charters,” a senior industry source said.
Cheniere denied to comment on its deals.
In general, traditional shipowners prefer to stick with long-term charters, which help them finance building new vessels, and let the energy firms and trading houses deal in the riskier short-term sublets.
But, given the potential money to be made, there are shipping companies focused almost entirely on servicing the LNG industry’s immediate or near-term requirements.
“The spot market is our priority now given the current rate environment as we don’t want to lock our ships in long-term charters prematurely in the recovery cycle,” said Oystein M. Kalleklev, CEO of Flex LNG, a shipping firm founded in 2006.
“We also do believe spot is becoming a much bigger part of the LNG shipping market as well as the overall LNG trade.”
Chartering a ship now for next winter is currently the only option for LNG companies looking to hedge their transport costs. But it is also risky.
Low LNG prices in Asia could limit trade, leaving a firm stuck with an expensive boat and no one to sub-let it to.
The solution would be a shipping futures contract which would allow a company to lock in a price for a future charter without taking a physical vessel - something that was developed for the oil tanker market in the 2000s.
There are fledgling moves towards creating LNG shipping futures contracts. Three brokers, Affinity, Braemar and SSY, have been working with the Baltic Exchange since last year to create LNG freight indices. One index went live in March and two more are in trials.
The indices - if accepted by the industry - could be the first step towards LNG freight futures.
“A lot of our clients see LNG freight hedging as a missing piece of the puzzle. This missing piece is having control over the forward freight,” said Benjamin Gibson, derivatives broker at Affinity.
“If you have more shipping capacity then you can react to spot market cargo demand more efficiently.”
The difficulty for the index is having enough deals to base a price on, according to Gibson.
Also, many transactions are discussed privately, making it difficult to find out what price was agreed.
“In order for Uniper to consider trading on LNG freight indices we would need to see what mechanisms are offered to make the trade possible. If they could work in principle, we would look into using those,” Fenzl said. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/electriccar-bubble-at-risk-of-bursting-in-china/,Electric-car bubble at risk of bursting in China,Business News,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"BEIJING: An iPhone assembler, e-commerce emporium and real-estate developer typically don’t compete in the same business – except when it comes to electric vehicles in China.
That’s because of a seismic shift toward EVs, which has spurred billions of dollars in investments by traditional carmakers, startups and titans of the internet, electronics and real-estate industries. 
The rush is on even as the government pulls back on the subsidies that juiced the industry to begin with.
There are now 486 EV manufacturers registered in China, more than triple the number from two years ago. While sales of passenger EVs are projected to reach a record 1.6 million units this year, that’s likely not enough to keep all those assembly lines humming, prompting warnings that the ballooning EV market could burst and leave behind only a few survivors.
“We are going to see great waves sweeping away sand in the EV industry,’’ said Thomas Fang, a partner and strategy consultant at Roland Berger in Shanghai. “It is a critical moment that will decide life or death for EV startups.’’
At least two dozen of those electric-car brands will be showcasing models at the Shanghai auto show starting this week. 
They range in expertise from nascent supercar maker Qiantu Motor to US-traded startup NIO Inc and elder statesman BYD Co.
Dozens of startups have entered the global EV business in recent years, raising US$18bil since 2011, according to BloombergNEF. 
Most of the biggest fundraisers are Chinese, including NIO, WM Motor, Xpeng Motors and Youxia Motors.
The startups promise to deliver a collective manufacturing capacity of 3.9 million vehicles a year. 
That’s excluding what some of the world’s biggest automakers are planning.
China’s big, but it’s not that big. Annual sales of passenger EVs only surpassed one million units for the first time last year, according to BNEF, spurred by the subsidies that could slice thousands of dollars off the sticker price.
Yet EV sales make up just 4% of overall passenger vehicle sales of 23.7 million units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
At the same time, sales of traditional cars are currently in a free fall, plunging for the 10th straight month in March as a slowing economy and trade tensions with the US weigh on consumer sentiment.
“There is still huge room out there in the new-energy vehicle market with China’s relatively low vehicle-penetration rate,’’ said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, an industry group.
“Yet that market is for the competitive players, not the weakest ones, and the latter will be squeezed out.’’
The government started pushing development of electric cars to help eliminate air pollution, reduce oil imports and develop high-technology manufacturing.
By 2025, China’s leaders want annual sales of new-energy vehicles - including pure-battery electrics, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars - to reach seven million units. 
That’s the equivalent of about 20% of China’s total auto market.
Even that amount would barely be enough to sustain a few dozen companies - not hundreds. A factory typically needs to produce at least tens of thousands of vehicles a year to be profitable.
Another headwind is the subsidy cut announced last month by the finance ministry, a move meant to encourage manufacturers to rely on innovation rather than assistance. Some subsidies that could total US$7,500 per vehicle were halved.
“With the subsidy adjustments, some less technologically advanced EV startups will disappear,’’ said Zhou Lei, a Tokyo-based partner for Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. “There will be a reshuffle.’’
Then there’s the swarm of global giants from Tesla Inc to Volkswagen AG to Ford Motor Co, all planning to flood the market with locally produced EVs.
Elon Musk’s company started selling its first mass-market model in China this year and plans to begin building vehicles in Shanghai by year’s end. 
Tesla sold 14,467 vehicles in China last year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
Toyota Motor Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. chose a quicker way in: they all plan to sell what’s essentially the same car, developed by Guangzhou Automobile Group.
More established local manufacturers, such as BYD, likely can withstand the competition and the subsidy cuts, given a track record spanning years, a lineup including cars and buses, and an existing customer base.
The Warren Buffett-backed company has boosted revenue for six straight years and turned a profit since at least 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Only companies that have solid technology reserves can stand out amid competition,’’ said Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD. 
“By owning core technologies, we can see further and deeper.’’
The ones facing the biggest risk are the upstarts still seeking their footing. 
Many are founded or funded by people with an internet or technology background, used to hefty cash-burn rates but still not necessarily fully aware of the massive investment needed for car manufacturing, Roland Berger’s Fang said.
“With more stringent requirements on subsidies, the pace of new-energy vehicle credit-gathering will slow but local manufacturers will probably maintain their lead. Foreign carmakers need to respond,” said Anjani Trivedi, a Bloomberg columnist.
The non-car companies spending heavily on EVs include Foxconn Technology Group, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and China Evergrande Group. 
Evergrande, better known for real estate development, has proclaimed it will become the world’s biggest EV maker in three to five years.
“The investment needed for actual production is several times of that they’ve spent on marketing and production development,’’ Fang said. 
“That’s why we are seeing some of them delaying mass-production plans.’’
Faraday Future, which has its headquarters and production facility in California, has yet to start building its first model.
Byton, led by former BMW AG managers, said last month it’s seeking US$700mil in backing after already raising US$500mil earlier this year, with a view to start manufacturing late this year.
Startups need to secure their funding within the next year or risk being wiped out, said Li Xiang, founder and chief executive officer of the Chehejia brand. 
After that, no investor will commit to a new contender while even the leading startups struggle to earn a profit.
Li, among the first to own Tesla’s Model S in China, started his Beijing-based company after successfully launching car-buying portal Autohome Inc, which trades in the US and has a market capitalisation exceeding US$12bil.
Chehejia - which recruited talent from Daimler AG, Toyota and BMW - plans to start deliveries in the fourth quarter, after initially aiming for 2017.
“A large amount of companies will be eliminated in a year, and 90 % of the investors will suffer great losses,’’ Li said. — Bloomberg"

Vivendi plans to sell the stake in UMG, whose soaring profit has been a key driver of the group’s stock price, in order to maximise UMG’s value and help fund the purchases of other businesses.
The growing public thirst for subscription and ad-based music streaming services, and the recent signing of several major licence deals, have put the owners of music rights such as UMG in investors’ spotlight as they compete with streaming platforms such as Spotify.
Vivendi’s sales jumped 10.7% from last year to 3.46bil (US$3.91bil), boosted by UMG and Vivendi’s recent acquisition of the Editis publishing business. 
A poll by In-Front Data for Reuters had forecast revenues of 3.39bil.
Vivendi shares rose 0.5% as analysts welcomed more strong figures from UMG.
UMG’s revenues rose 22.9% from last year to 1.5 billion euros, helped by chart-topping songs from US pop singer Ariana Grande and sales from the soundtrack of hit movie “A Star Is Born”.
“Organic revenue growth at 5.7% was very strong, driven by over 18.8% organic growth at its Universal Music Group division, with recorded music up over 19% year-on-year organically,” wrote analysts at Liberum, which kept a “buy” rating on Vivendi shares.
“This should bode well for profit growth, given it is driven by streaming, which should have a high (40%) drop through rate to profits,” added Liberum.
Vivendi has said it could sell up to 50% of UMG to one or several of its strategic partners. 
Analysts value the stake at between 20bil and 40bil.
“The process of selecting the potential partnering banks and the advisers should be completed shortly. 
“PwC has been engaged to conduct the ‘vendor due diligence’, which is ongoing. It is expected to be completed in the coming weeks and will be provided to the selected banks,” Vivendi said in a statement.
Vincent Bollore, whose holding company Bollore Group owns about 26% of Vivendi’s share capital, is to be formally replaced by his son Cyrille on the company’s board this month. — Reuters"

The two join Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, both of which are the sponsors, or leads, for the planned Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) which could raise up to US$5bil for the heavily-indebted brewer, the sources said.
With main markets China and Australia, the region last year made up 18% of group volume and 14% of underlying operating profit, which in turn rose 13% to US$3.1bil. 
It was not clear how much of the business was up for sale.
AB InBev and BAML did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citi declined to comment.
The Leuven, Belgium-based maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois brands aims to spin-off its Asia-Pacific business to reduce leverage, the people said.
AB InBev’s net debt stood at US$102.5bil at the end of December, a figure inflated by its late 2016 purchase of nearest rival SABMiller for around US$100bil. 
AB InBev wants to bring its net debt/EBITDA ratio to around two times from a multiple of 4.6 at the end of last year. 
With that goal, it has halved its proposed dividend and said payouts will only grow slowly.
While AB InBev’s shares have risen 19% since reporting forecast-beating earnings in February, the brewer is battling to reverse a longer share price decline. 
Over the past two years, its shares have fallen 24%, in contrast to rivals Heineken and Carlsberg, which have gained 15% and 28% respectively.
The IPO would not be the first time AB InBev has sold Asia-Pacific assets to reduce debt. 
After InBev bought Anheuser-Busch in 2008, AB InBev sold South Korean unit Oriental Brewery to private equity firm KKR -–only to buy it back in 2014.
The IPO is slated for the second half of the year and the brewer expects to file with the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half, the people said. 
One of the people said the filing would happen either later this month or early May.
At US$5bil, the IPO could be the largest in Hong Kong this year, where the flood of companies looking to go public has slowed to a trickle.
Companies have raised US$2.9bil through Hong Kong listings so far this year, lagging the US$6.4bil raised on New York’s Nasdaq, showed Refinitiv data as of Friday. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/indonesia-posts-surprise-trade-surplus-in-march/,Indonesia posts surprise trade surplus in March,Business News,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"JAKARTA: Indonesia posted a surprise trade surplus for a second straight month in March, supporting the central bank’s outlook of a narrowing current account deficit, but economists warn a trade deficit could return after Wednesday’s presidential elections.
Indonesia had a surplus of US$540mil in March, the largest since June 2018 and compared with a forecast of US$180mil deficit in a Reuters poll. This followed February’s surprise US$330mil surplus.
Last year’s record US$8.5bil trade deficit has been used by opposition candidate Prabowo Subianto to attack President Joko Widodo, saying the incumbent has managed the economy badly.
Widodo said efforts by his administration to reverse the deficit, including raising tariffs to halt imports and relaxing rules to support exports, have been successful in narrowing the trade gap in the first quarter.
Indonesians will vote on Wednesday to decide who gets to lead South-East Asia’s largest economy in the next five years.
A risk of trade deficit returning after this week’s elections is “highly likely”, said Bhima Yudhistira Adhinegara, an economist with the Jakarta-based think tank Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF).
He argues that imports of building materials used in Widodo’s infrastructure push, which have been paused since last year, could resume after the elections.
“If the candidate No. 2 wins, he has pledged to cut staple prices within his first 100 days, so he would likely have to import food too,” Adhinegara said, referring to Prabowo.
Wisnu Wardana, an economist with Bank Danamon, said investment-related imports appeared to have been halted in the first quarter and that the sustainability of trade surplus would depend on whether investment picks up post elections.
Imports fell 6.76% from a year earlier to US$13.49bil in March, marking the third consecutive month of contraction, led by declining shipments of raw materials. The poll had forecast a 3.76% decline.
Meanwhile, exports dropped sharply, at a 10.01% on-year rate, to US$14.03bil, although not as much as the 11.82% fall expected in the poll.Analysts say an improvement in trade and current account deficits is a determining factor for Bank Indonesia (BI) to start loosening monetary policy, now that inflation is stable and the US Federal Reserve will probably not raise rates further this year.
BI last year increased rates by a total of 175 basis points in response to a weak rupiah and capital outflows that were partly prompted by rising US interest rates and large trade and current account deficits.
The latest data suggested 2019’s current account gap would narrow to 2.78% of GDP from 2.98% last year, Bank Mandiri’s economist Andry Asmoro said.
BI may also wait and see what kind of economic changes the elections bring before cutting interest rates, said INDEF’s Adhinegara.

In return, Toyota will have preferential rights to purchase green-car credits that Singulato will generate under China’s new quota system for all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
It will also gain a bird’s eyeview into how Chinese EV startups operate and the strategies they pursue in a fast-changing marketplace, said Singulato chief executive Shen Haiyin and two sources at the Japanese automaker.
“With electrification, autonomous driving and car-sharing shaking up the industry, old ways need to be re-examined,” a Toyota source said.
“We have a century’s lead in automotive technology, but we also need to be humble enough to learn from newcomers.”
Singulato will acquire a licence to use the design of Toyota’s eQ – a battery electric microcar. The deal is due to be announced today at the Shanghai auto show, where Singulato will unveil a concept car based on the eQ.
Singulato plans to redesign the car, tailoring it to local tastes to come up with a model by early 2021 that is more affordable and offers a longer driving range.
“This deal gives us a way to save on time and costs to develop a reliable car and focus on what we excel in,” Shen told Reuters.
Financial terms are not expected to be disclosed. A Singulato source said the startup agreed to pay “several tens of millions of dollars” for eQ’s design.
Toyota said it was taking various measures to accelerate its business in China, a key market, but it would not comment on specific steps.
The agreement is a vote of confidence by Toyota in Singulato’s prospects, said Shen. 
Founded in 2014 and backed by Intel Corp and Japanese trading house Itochu Corp, Singulato is one of at least 50 Chinese EV startups seeking to survive in a competitive market.
It plans to sell its first self-developed battery electric car called the iS6 this year, competing with models from rival startups like Nio and WM Motor as well as those from global automakers.
Singulato’s version of the eQ will be a so-called connected car offering young buyers a host of entertainment, safety and navigation features. The car, which will be called the iC3, will also feature some self-driving technology.
Toyota sold about 100 eQ cars in 2012 and then discontinued it due to concerns over the limits of EVs, including their high price tags, short driving range and long charge time. But Singulato believes technological advances, especially in batteries, have made the car much more marketable.
Shen said the iC3 should be able to go as far as 250-300 km on a single full charge and will be priced around 100,000 yuan (RM61,735). Singulato aims to sell 200,000 units over five years.
According to the two Toyota sources, the deal is part of efforts to share more technology with China as the Japanese automaker seeks more growth in the world’s largest auto market by beefing up manufacturing capacity and distribution channels.
The deal dovetails with Toyota’s announcement this month that it would be offering automakers and suppliers free access to nearly 24,000 patents for EV technologies.  — Reuters"

But while all three major U.S. stock indexes edged lower, the S&P 500 remained within a percent of its record high.

Following a January-March rally that marked the U.S. stock market's best quarterly performance in nearly a decade, stocks had been in a holding pattern in April ahead of first quarter reporting season.

Goldman Sachs dipped 3.8% after the investment bank's first quarter revenue came in below analyst expectations.

Citigroup Inc posted higher-than-expected earnings as cost-cutting offset falling revenues. Its shares ended the session nominally lower, dropping 0.1%.

""We're coming off of a strong week last week,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""So any bad news or earnings reports this week, such as we saw with Goldman and Citigroup, is going to take away some of that momentum.""

With first quarter reporting season shifting into high gear, analysts now see S&P 500 companies posting a 2.1% year-on-year decline in profits. While an improvement over recent estimates, it would still mark the first annual decline in earnings since 2016.

""We'll get a clearer sense as we move through the week,"" Sroka added. ""As we move into other sectors we'll get a clearer picture of corporate earnings and the economy.""

Bank of America Co, Morgan Stanley, Netflix Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Textron Inc, Honeywell International Inc, Schlumberger NV and American Express Co are among the closely-watched earnings expected this holiday-shortened week.

Aside from earnings, ""we still have to be watchful for global geopolitical events such as the U.S.-China trade discussion,"" warned Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.

Sources said U.S. negotiators have softened their demands that China curb industrial subsidies as a condition for a trade deal, marking a retreat from a core U.S. objective.

""It's a net positive,"" Stovall said. ""The president wants to get some sort of deal signed so he can move on.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26,384.77, the S&P 500 lost 1.83 points, or 0.06%, to 2,905.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.15 points, or 0.1%, to 7,976.01.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six ended the session in the red.

Financials were the biggest percentage losers, closing down 0.6% and snapping their three-day winning streak.

Waste Management Inc rose 2.4% following its announcement that it would buy smaller rival Advanced Disposal Services Inc for about $3 billion.

Boeing Co slid 1.1% after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the planemaker should fix and ""rebrand"" its 737 MAX jet.

Lyft Inc extended its slide, falling 6.3%. The ride-hailing platform, which had its market debut in March, is now trading about 22% below its $72 offer price.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 46 new lows.

It said on Monday CPO prices have been persistently weaker than expected (1Q 2019: RM2,017), weighed down by strong production growth that has in turn raised inventory levels. 

The rating agency said the lower forecast was also compounded by concerns about the impact of the US-China trade war on demand for edible oils, a sizeable supply of vegetable oils. They concerns included negative developments in Europe on the sustainability of oil palm cultivation and the use of this tropical oil in biofuel production. 

That said, we still anticipate a pick-up in demand from food-based consumption growth and for biodiesel production, amid stable output growth.

Local CPO production rose 10% on-year in Q1 2019, after having unexpectedly slowed down to 19.5 million tonnes in 2018 (-2% on-year), the latter due to weaker yields. 

However, Indonesia registered a bumper crop of 47.4 mil tonnes last year (+13% on-year) and maintained a strong expansion of 22% in January-February 9019. 

“We expect both Malaysia and Indonesia to post modest single-digit production growth this year,” it said.

RAM said CPO prices could also face downward pressure as the US Department of Agriculture estimates the supply of vegetable oils will expand 3% in 2018/2019. 

On the demand front, Malaysia’s crude and processed palm oil exports rose 8% on-year in Q1 2019, after a flat performance in 2018. The improvement was underscored by more robust demand from India, China, Pakistan and the US. 

Soft CPO prices and zero export duties since Sept 1, 2018 had likely triggered purchases of this tropical oil, as had India’s reduced import duties on CPO and refined palm oil products, effective  Jan 1, 2019. 

Meanwhile, Indonesian exports of palm products went up 3% in 2018, followed by another 15% in January-February of 2019. 

“Demand for CPO is expected to remain supported by food-based consumption growth and demand from biodiesel producers,” RAM said. 

As at end-March 2019, Malaysia’s inventory level had increased by 23% on-year to 2.9 million tonnes. 

Conversely, Indonesia’s stockpile had diminished 29% on-year to 2.5 million tonnes as at end-February 2019 due to robust external and domestic demand. 

Notably, Indonesia’s move to extend the use of the B20 biodiesel to non-subsidised vehicles since 1 September 2018 had substantially boosted its consumption of this commodity to 3.9 mil kilolitres last year (2017: 2.6 mil kilolitres). 

Indonesia has allocated 6.2 million kilolitres of biodiesel to the B20 programme in 2019, which will support CPO demand. 

Malaysia began implementing the B10 programme for the transportation sector in phases in December 2018; the B7 scheme will be executed for the industrial sector in July 2019. 

The programmes in both countries could use up to 6.5 million tonnes of CPO (about 10% of their production last year)."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/foxconn-poised-to-begin-mass-production-of-iphones-in-india/,Foxconn poised to begin mass production of iPhones in India,Corporate News,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",4:41 PM MYT,"TAIPEI: Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Terry Gou said the iPhone will go into mass production in India this year, a shift for the largest assembler of Apple Inc.’s handsets that has long concentrated production in China.

Gou said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited him to India as his Taiwanese company plans its expansion in the country. 

Apple has had older phones produced at a plant in Bangalore for several years, but now will expand manufacturing to more recent models. 

Bloomberg News reported this month that Foxconn is ready to start trial production of the latest iPhones in the country before it starts full-scale assembly at its factory outside the southern city of Chennai.

India has become the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world, while China stagnates and Apple loses share to local competitors such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. 

Apple has been a minor player in India, in part because of its high prices, but local manufacturing would help the Cupertino, California-based company avoid import duties of 20 percent.

“In the future we will play a very important role in India’s smartphone industry,” Gou said at an event in Taiwan. “We have moved our production lines there.”

Gou also said on Monday that he plans to step back from daily operations to focus on broader strategy. The founder isn’t stepping down or relinquishing his chairmanship, said Louis Woo, special assistant to Gou.

It’s not yet clear how Apple’s steps into India will affect its China operations. China has been the company’s most important manufacturing base for years, home to Foxconn’s biggest facilities and hundreds of other partners.

Foxconn already has two assembly sites in the southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, where it makes devices for Xiaomi and Nokia. Locating more production in India would help diversify Apple and Foxconn’s manufacturing footprint away from China amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.

The Indian assembly line of Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. would serve local and export markets by the time Apple announces its next iPhone models in September, people familiar with the matter have said. 

The Taiwanese contract manufacturer, the biggest maker of iPhones, will initially invest about $300 million to set up for Apple with investments to ramp up as capacity expands, they said.

Gou said that his company is talking with the government about investment terms. He has a dozen software people in India and he plans to increase that to 600, he said.

“We are the primary assembler after all,” Gou said on Monday. “If our customer wants to boost its scale, it will need to depend on us to grow the comprehensive supply chain.”

Producing phones locally would also help Apple’s retail push in India. The company needs to meet a 30 percent local sourcing rule to be able to open its own stores in the country.

Indians bought more than 140 million smartphones last year, with just 1.7 million sold by Apple, as consumers favored cheaper models from China. On Xiaomi’s Indian website, the Redmi Note 7 has a price of 9,999 rupees ($143), which is about a 10th the price of Apple’s iPhone Xs in the country. - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/the-us$18bil-electric-car-bubble-at-risk-of-bursting-in-china/,The US$18bil electric car bubble at risk of bursting in China,Auto,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",4:54 PM MYT,"BEIJING: An iPhone assembler, e-commerce emporium and real-estate developer typically don’t compete in the same business -- except when it comes to electric vehicles in China.

That’s because of a seismic shift toward EVs, which has spurred billions of dollars in investments by traditional carmakers, startups and titans of the internet, electronics and real-estate industries. The rush is on even as the government pulls back on the subsidies that juiced the industry to begin with.

There are now 486 EV manufacturers registered in China, more than triple the number from two years ago. While sales of passenger EVs are projected to reach a record 1.6 million units this year, that’s likely not enough to keep all those assembly lines humming, prompting warnings that the ballooning EV market could burst and leave behind only a few survivors.

“We are going to see great waves sweeping away sand in the EV industry,’’ said Thomas Fang, a partner and strategy consultant at Roland Berger in Shanghai. “It is a critical moment that will decide life or death for EV startups.’’

At least two dozen of those electric-car brands will be showcasing models at the Shanghai auto show starting this week. They range in expertise from nascent supercar maker Qiantu Motor to U.S.-traded startup NIO Inc. and elder statesman BYD Co.

Dozens of startups have entered the global EV business in recent years, raising $18 billion since 2011, according to BloombergNEF. Most of the biggest fundraisers are Chinese, including NIO, WM Motor, Xpeng Motors and Youxia Motors.

The startups promise to deliver a collective manufacturing capacity of 3.9 million vehicles a year. That’s excluding what some of the world’s biggest automakers are planning.

China’s big, but it’s not that big. Annual sales of passenger EVs only surpassed 1 million units for the first time last year, according to BNEF, spurred by the subsidies that could slice thousands of dollars off the sticker price.

Yet EV sales make up just 4 percent of overall passenger vehicle sales of 23.7 million units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

At the same time, sales of traditional cars are currently in a free fall, plunging for the 10th straight month in March as a slowing economy and trade tensions with the U.S. weigh on consumer sentiment.

“There is still huge room out there in the new-energy vehicle market with China’s relatively low vehicle-penetration rate,’’ said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, an industry group. “Yet that market is for the competitive players, not the weakest ones, and the latter will be squeezed out.’’

The government started pushing development of electric cars to help eliminate air pollution, reduce oil imports and develop high-technology manufacturing.

By 2025, China’s leaders want annual sales of new-energy vehicles â“- including pure-battery electrics, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars -- to reach 7 million units. That’s the equivalent of about 20 percent of China’s total auto market.

Even that amount would barely be enough to sustain a few dozen companies -- not hundreds. A factory typically needs to produce at least tens of thousands of vehicles a year to be profitable.

Another headwind is the subsidy cut announced last month by the finance ministry, a move meant to encourage manufacturers to rely on innovation rather than assistance. Some subsidies that could total $7,500 per vehicle were halved.

“With the subsidy adjustments, some less technologically advanced EV startups will disappear,’’ said Zhou Lei, a Tokyo-based partner for Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. “There will be a reshuffle.’’

Then there’s the swarm of global giants from Tesla Inc. to Volkswagen AG to Ford Motor Co., all planning to flood the market with locally produced EVs.

Elon Musk’s company started selling its first mass-market model in China this year and plans to begin building vehicles in Shanghai by year’s end. Tesla sold 14,467 vehicles in China last year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

Toyota Motor Corp., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co., and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. chose a quicker way in: they all plan to sell what’s essentially the same car, developed by Guangzhou Automobile Group.

More established local manufacturers, such as BYD, likely can withstand the competition and the subsidy cuts, given a track record spanning years, a lineup including cars and buses, and an existing customer base.

The Warren Buffett-backed company has boosted revenue for six straight years and turned a profit since at least 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“Only companies that have solid technology reserves can stand out amid competition,’’ said Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD. “By owning core technologies, we can see further and deeper.’’

The ones facing the biggest risk are the upstarts still seeking their footing. Many are founded or funded by people with an internet or technology background, used to hefty cash-burn rates but still not necessarily fully aware of the massive investment needed for car manufacturing, Roland Berger’s Fang said.

”With more stringent requirements on subsidies, the pace of new-energy vehicle credit-gathering will slow but local manufacturers will probably maintain their lead. Foreign carmakers need to respond.”

The non-car companies spending heavily on EVs include Foxconn Technology Group, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and China Evergrande Group. Evergrande, better known for real estate development, has proclaimed it will become the world’s biggest EV maker in three to five years.

“The investment needed for actual production is several times of that they’ve spent on marketing and production development,’’ Fang said. “That’s why we are seeing some of them delaying mass-production plans.’’

Faraday Future, which has its headquarters and production facility in California, has yet to start building its first model.

Byton, led by former BMW AG managers, said last month it’s seeking $700 million in backing after already raising $500 million earlier this year, with a view to start manufacturing late this year.

Startups need to secure their funding within the next year or risk being wiped out, said Li Xiang, founder and chief executive officer of the Chehejia brand. After that, no investor will commit to a new contender while even the leading startups struggle to earn a profit.

Li, among the first to own Tesla’s Model S in China, started his Beijing-based company after successfully launching car-buying portal Autohome Inc., which trades in the U.S. and has a market capitalization exceeding $12 billion.

Chehejia - which recruited talent from Daimler AG, Toyota and BMW -- plans to start deliveries in the fourth quarter, after initially aiming for 2017.

“A large amount of companies will be eliminated in a year, and 90 percent of the investors will suffer great losses,’’ Li said.- Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/water-giants-race-to-curb-plastic-waste/,Water giants race to curb plastic waste,Corporate News,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",5:07 PM MYT,"ZURICH: Two of the world’s biggest water companies are thinking outside the bottle about how to hydrate consumers as environmental campaigners take aim at the enormous amount of plastic waste the industry produces.

Danone’s Evian plans to start selling an in-home water appliance featuring a balloon-like container that cuts down on plastic use, while Nestle SA is working on an out-of-home dispensing system based on refillable bottles.

The moves are aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of a business that packages water from natural springs and transports it over long distances, with many bottles ending up polluting the oceans after they’re discarded. 

Previous efforts to reduce the amount of plastic used, such as shrinking the size of caps, have made only minor differences. Now, as consumer groups and politicians step up pressure, the biggest players in the business are looking at more radical measures.

Danone’s Evian Renew system, to be announced Monday, is made up of a base dispenser and an exchangeable 5-liter (1.3-gallon) bubble that contains the water. The recyclable bubble contains 66 percent less plastic than a 1.5-liter Evian bottle, and features a skin so thin that it contracts to a new shape after each use and collapses once empty.

Nestle Waters’ system, to be introduced early next year, will allow consumers to access filtered water that can be customized with flavors or carbonation, a spokeswoman said, without providing details.

Governments around the world have been stepping up action to reduce plastic, from banning drinking straws to imposing fees on supermarket bags. The European Parliament last month approved a prohibition on single-use plastic consumer items from 2021.

Environmental group Greenpeace called out Nestle at its annual general meeting last week for its reliance on single-use plastic, urging the world’s largest food company to invest in alternative delivery systems based on refilling containers. Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has said reuse alone wouldn’t solve the problem of waste.

Fizzy Drinks

While water coolers are office fixtures, Danone may have to overcome consumer reluctance to fill limited kitchen space with yet another appliance. Fizzy-drinks dispensers from SodaStream International Ltd., which PepsiCo Inc. bought for $3.2 billion last year, have managed to break through.

Evian Renew eliminates the need to haul heavy water bottles home by providing delivery. The base is connected to a digital app that notifies consumers when a refill is due and lets them place an order by touching a button. 

The system aims to build customer loyalty by linking the product to the dispenser, as Nestle has done with its Nespresso coffee business.

Evian will start a four-month pilot phase with 200 consumers in Paris and London in September, aiming to roll out the system more broadly later. A Danone spokeswoman said pricing is still under review. Patricia Oliva, Evian’s head of marketing, said Evian is on track toward its goals of becoming carbon neutral by 2020 and using only recycled plastic by 2025.

A change in leadership would come at a delicate time for the world's largest contract manufacturer, which is trying to reinvent itself to cut its reliance on Apple as smartphone sales plateau and as the iPhone maker diversifies its supplier base. 
It would mark another top-level change at a tech firm in Greater China.

Jack Ma, co-founder of China's Alibaba Group, said in September he will step down as chairman in a year to allow for younger management. And Morris Chang, founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), another Apple supplier, retired last year.

Terry Gou, speaking on the sidelines of an event in Taipei, said that while he planned to resign as Foxconn chairman, he hoped to remain involved in strategic decisions regarding the company's business.

When asked by Reuters if he would quit as chairman, Gou said he was moving in that direction, although any decision needed to be discussed with the company's board.

""I don't know where you got the information from. But I have to say, basically, I'm working towards that direction - to walk back to the second line, or retire,"" Gou said.

""I will be involved in the major direction of the company, but not involved in daily operations.

""I'm already 69 years old. I can pass down my 45 years of experience. That's the goal I set up - to let young people learn sooner and take over sooner and to replace my position sooner.""

Gou said his plans would be discussed with the board of Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, in the coming months and shareholders would be told at the AGM in June.

A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Lu Sung-Ching, the chairman of Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd , the electronic and optoelectronic connectors unit of Foxconn, was among the possible candidates to take over from Gou.
""It doesn't mean he will just be gone. He will remove himself to the second line and he would not be involved in the daily operations,"" the source said.

SHARES CLIMB

Shares of Foxconn, which has a market value of $40 billion, rose after the news and closed 3.2 percent higher on Monday.

The news comes as tech companies are seeking to diversify their customer base and move into emerging industries such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.

Foxconn, which celebrated 30 years of doing business in China last year, has far-flung businesses that include autonomous car startups and investments in cancer research.

In January, the Nikkei reported that Foxconn had let go around 50,000 contract workers in China since October.

Foxconn acquired control of Japan’s Sharp Corp in 2016 to try to boost the Taiwanese company’s advanced screen technology.

Founded in 1974, the Foxconn group has grown to become the world's biggest contract manufacturer with T$5.2 trillion ($168.52 billion) in annual revenue, assembling goods for Apple, SoftBank Group Corp and other global tech firms. It 

relies on Apple for more than half of annual revenue, according to analysts.

Gou, who owns 9.4 percent of Foxconn as its top shareholder, is Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.

Last month, Foxconn reported a smaller than expected fall in quarterly profit, despite warning signs from key customers including Apple that demand for tech electronics was softening.

The news comes three months after Reuters reported Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus. Foxconn later reiterated it would still build a factory in Wisconsin after Gou spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/15/ab-inbev-adds-citi-baml-to-banks-working-on-us$5b-asian-ipo/,"AB InBev adds Citi, BAML to banks working on US$5b Asian IPO",Corporate News,"Monday, 15 Apr 2019",6:47 PM MYT,"HONG KONG: The world's biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, has added Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to the team of banks working on the sale of its Asia-Pacific business, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 

The two join Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, both of which are the sponsors, or leads, for the planned Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) which could raise up to $5 billion for the heavily indebted brewer, the people said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

With main markets China and Australia, the region last year made up 18 percent of group volume and 14 percent of underlying operating profit, which in turn rose 13 percent to $3.1 billion. It was not clear how much of the business was up for sale.

AB InBev did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citi and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment.

The Leuven, Belgium-based maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois brands aims to spin-off its Asia-Pacific business to reduce leverage, the people said.

AB InBev's net debt stood at $102.5 billion at the end of December, a figure inflated by its late 2016 purchase of nearest rival SABMiller for around $100 billion. AB InBev wants to bring its net debt/EBITDA ratio to around two times from a multiple of 4.6 at the end of last year. With that goal, it has halved its proposed dividend and said payouts will only grow slowly.

While AB InBev's shares have risen 19 percent since reporting forecast-beating earnings in February, the brewer is battling to reverse a longer share price decline. Over the past two years, its shares have fallen 24 percent, in contrast to rivals Heineken and Carlsberg, which have gained 15 and 28 percent respectively.

The IPO would not be the first time AB InBev has sold Asia-Pacific assets to reduce debt. After InBev bought Anheuser-Busch in 2008, AB InBev sold South Korean unit Oriental Brewery to private equity firm KKR - only to buy it back in 2014.

The IPO is slated for the second half of the year and the brewer expects to file with the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half, the people said. One of the people said the filing would happen either later this month or early May.

At $5 billion, the IPO could be the largest in Hong Kong this year, where the flood of companies looking to go public has slowed to a trickle.

Companies have raised $2.9 billion through Hong Kong listings so far this year, lagging the $6.4 billion raised on New York's Nasdaq, showed Refinitiv data as of Friday.

Hong Kong topped all other exchanges globally last year with stock market listings raising $36.3 billion. This year, however, is widely expected to be slower due to thinning numbers of Chinese companies looking to go public, particularly in tech. - Reuters"

China’s third largest developer said on Monday it had sold US$200mil in three-year notes, and an additional US$400mil each in four- and five-year bonds.
The notes carry coupons of between 9.5% and 10.5%, and have the same terms and conditions as US$2bil of bonds Evergrande sold last week.
Evergrande has now tapped bond markets for a total of US$6.6bil this year, according to data from Refinitiv, including those issued through subsidiary Hengda Real Estate Group.
Its latest sale took it past Chinese gaming giant Tencent , which sold US$6bil of bonds earlier this month.
Sales of Asian junk bonds have had a blistering start to the year on expectations for lower interest rates and as a market rally has stoked risk appetite. Evergrande would use the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness and for capital expenditure, it added.
Fitch said in a release the developer expected to spend 20 billion yuan on non-property businesses, including the research, development and production of electric vehicles. This compares to the 16 billion yuan in non-property capex in 2018.
“The key concern is the company has been issuing more bonds since there’s been an easing in liquidity, both onshore and offshore, and part of the proceeds are not used for refinancing,” said S&P analyst Matthew Chow. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/16/prestariang-takes-govt-to-court/,Prestariang takes govt to court,Business News,"Tuesday, 16 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Having failed to reach a settlement following several rounds of negotiations, Prestariang Bhd  has decided to take the federal government to court to sue for compensation over the termination of its contract.
The group’s subsidiary, Prestariang SKIN Sdn Bhd (PSKIN), has named the government as defendant in a RM732.86mil legal claim in relation to the cancellation of the RM3.5bil national immigration control system (SKIN) project.
This follows the government’s unilateral termination of the project by way of expropriation in January this year.
The sum it is seeking, Prestariang said, was calculated  based on the contractual formula provided in the 15-year concession agreement (CA) it had entered into with the government back in August 2017.
In a statement, the group said the parties involved had engaged in a few rounds of negotiations, but were “unable to reach an amicable settlement on the quantum”. 
“As a last resort, the board of Prestariang is now fiducially obligated and compelled to litigate for its contractual payment,” it said.
PSKIN, in August 2017, had secured the 15-year concession to design, deliver, continuously maintain and provide scheduled upgrades for a new and improved immigration and border control system for the Immigration Department.
The new system was to replace the existing Malaysian Immigration System (MyIMMS).
It was agreed that PSKIN would receive about RM3.5bil over the 15-year period, subject to the entire capital expenditure being privately funded by PSkin. 
However, the group, via a letter from the Home Ministry in December last year, was informed of the Cabinet’s decision to terminate the project, with the termination taking effect the following month.
The news sent the share price of Prestariang, which has a 70% stake in the project through PSkin, plunging close to six-year lows.
Prestariang, in the statement yesterday, said its subsidiary had undertaken extensive technical studies and works on the project since 2014, and had incurred a substantial amount of expenses.
“PSKIN had also entered into numerous third-party contracts for the purpose of executing the SKIN project,” it said.
Before it was awarded the contract, PSKIN had to undergo three years of technical, commercial and legal evaluation by the Home Ministry and other government agencies.Prestariang said PSKIN, in the legal claim filed yesterday, noted that the CA clearly spelt out the government’s obligations in the event that the project was unilaterally terminated by way of expropriation. 
It reiterated that its subsidiary has never defaulted on the CA, and that it “strongly believes that the CA was fair and reasonable”.
The SKIN project is among several big-budget agreements entered into by the government under Barisan Nasional, which then came under review after Pakatan Harapan took over last year.
In defending the cancellation of the project, Home Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said at the time that the ministry had found weaknesses in the terms of the CA and implementation of the project.
Among the weaknesses, he said, were that the contract terms were more favourable to the company than the government, the exorbitant cost of the project and the limited scope of the project which did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Department.
While Prestariang later confirmed that it did not plan to contest the government’s unilateral move, and would instead seek compensation, there were reports that Kumpulan Wang Persaraan Diperbadankan (KWAP) was seeking to revive the project by offering to lower the cost.
StarBiz reported last month, quoting sources, that KWAP had proposed to cut the cost of the project by 17% to RM2.89bil if the government agreed to revive it.
KWAP currently holds a 5.84% stake in Prestariang, according to Bloomberg data.
Prestariang yesterday saw its largest decline in a single day this year, after tumbling seven sen or 11.7% to close at 53 sen."

AmInvestment Bank Research said the company’s flour and poultry divisions would improve, and has maintained its “buy” call with an unchanged fair value of 89 sen.
The research house said its recent meeting with MFM affirmed its positive outlook on the group.
The research house expected the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of MFM’s flour division to improve by 11.1% to RM73.2mil in its current financial year on the back of lower wheat costs, which accounts for more than half of the production costs.
The group imported a variety of wheat from countries such as Australia, Canada, the United States and Russia. Using soft red winter wheat as a gauge and according to Bloomberg, the average price of wheat has declined by 7.4% to US$4.94/bushel in 1QFY19 from US$5.33/bushel in 1QFY18.
As for the poultry division, AmInvestment Bank Research expected it to swing to a positive EBIT of RM34.6mil in FY19F from a loss of RM0.9mil in FY18 on the back of higher sales volume and lower feedmeal costs.
“After being hit by a poultry disease and fewer contract farmers in FY18, we believe that sales volume of live birds and broilers would increase in FY19F.
“Feedmeal accounts for almost 70% of the cost of production of the poultry division. It comprises mainly corn and soybean,” the research house said in a note.
Corn and soybean prices have been in the doldrums due to ample global inventories.
The average price of US soybean was US$9.17/bushel in 1QFY19 compared to US$10.20/bushel in 1QFY18 according to Bloomberg.
The average selling price of live birds on the other hand was flat year-on-year (y-o-y) but 6.7% higher quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in 1QFY19.
The selling price declined 8.3% y-o-y in the first week of April which the research house gathered, was due to weak demand.
“We understand that demand for chickens would start to pick up again in the next few weeks ahead of the fasting period in May and Hari Raya festivities in June,” AmInvestment Bank Research said.
Meanwhile, MFM’s new poultry plant in Lumut is expected to be commissioned in 4Q2019. The new plant is expected to increase its slaughtering capacity by 50% from 80,000 birds per day currently to 120,000.
The company would also be able to raise its broiler population to more than 80 million from 66 million per year. They are expected to underpin the group’s net profit growth in FY20F and FY21F.

Revenue for the period under review rose 3.1% to RM392.70mil from RM380.99mil a year ago.
LPI Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow said despite the operating environment remaining challenging, the group managed to improve its performance in the first quarter of financial year 2019 (1Q19).
“Lonpac Insurance Bhd, the wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of LPI, reported a marginal improvement in its performance for 1Q19,” he said in a statement.
Lonpac’s pre-tax profit increased 3.5% to RM79.1mil from RM76.4mil but its gross written premium was 4.6% lower at RM460.9mil versus RM483.2 mil previously.
Teh said this was due partly to the absence of government infrastructure projects and compressed premium pricing.
Lonpac’s net earned premium income rose 8.9% to RM235.6mil from RM216.4mil due to a lower reinsurance ratio of 39.0% for the quarter as compared to the 42.5% reported previously.
The claims incurred ratio of Lonpac increased slightly to 47.4% from 47.1% and with the management expense ratio at 22.0% and commission ratio at a higher 5.2%, the combined ratio was recorded at 74.6%, an increase from the 72.4% reported in the previous corresponding quarter.
“With a higher combined ratio but an improved net earned premium written, Lonpac was able to register an underwriting profit of RM59.6mil,” he said.
Teh said that continued uncertainties in the global economy, coupled with stiff competition in the local insurance market in light of a liberalising market, would remain the main challenges for the group.
“However, the government’s plan to proceed with the implementation of some infrastructure projects that had been suspended earlier would spur the demand for insurance coverage, especially in project insurance where Lonpac is an active player.
“We will continue to innovate new products to meet the insurance needs of the customers and further strengthen our market position. 
“With the concerted efforts of the staff and support from our partners, we are confident that the group would be able to continue reporting an improved performance and create value for shareholders,” Teh said."

The revised alignment will cover Kota Baru-Mentakab-Jelebu-Kuala Kelawang-Bangi/Putrajaya-Port Klang, which will remove the tunnel-intensive  Gombak-Bentong-Mentakab route.
UOB Kay Hian said the lower project cost would likely involve significantly higher local content, hence benefitting local construction players.
“The renegotiated ECRL project comes with savings of RM21.5bil and would further benefit local contractors, as the revised contract requires additional local content.”
Maybank Investment Bank Research said its expects both cement and long-steel players to gain from a broad-based demand recovery in the second half of 2019 from the resumption of the ECRL project.
“However, we think the project would only contribute significantly to the sector from 2020, given that the project is still at an early stage of works.”
Separately, MIDF Research said the ECRL revival could lead to a possible spillover effect on local port operators.
“Aside from construction companies, ports in Malaysia such as Kuantan Port and Port Klang are expected to benefit from the resumption of the ECRL project.
“ The only main change from the previous plan connecting to ports was the removal of the Integrated Transport Terminal (ITT) in Gombak under the Mentakab-Port Klang route.
“In lieu of this, Port Klang will be connected to Mentakab via Putrajaya, Bangi, Kajang, Kuala Kelawang and Jelebu. The reason for the change is to avoid the ECRL from passing across the 16km-long Klang Gates Quartz Ridge.”
MIDF Research said passing across this area would entail a high cost to build a 17.8-km tunnel from Bentong to Gombak; and would trim the chances of Selangor’s bid to list the Quartz Ridge as a Unesco heritage site. Public Investment Bank Research said the ECRL’s new route is expected to benefit developments within the surrounding area.
“The new alignment of the ECRL rail network is designed to provide much-improved connectivity throughout the east coast region, as well as connecting it to the west coast, while at the same time, taking into consideration the potential growth for the industrial, commercial and tourism sectors along the ECRL corridor.
“On the east coast, the project will be the game changer for industries and existing developments in the region that will see the emergence of additional trade routes. The project will link several key east coast industrial hubs such as Kertih Port, Kemaman Port and Kuantan Port directly to the west coast of the peninsula.”
Crossing Negri Sembilan, the research house said the ECRL could benefit Sime Darby Property and Sime Darby Group’s projects in the new economic corridor, namely, Malaysian Vision Valley (MVV).
Straddling the districts of Seremban, Nilai and Port Dickson, the MVV has been slated to be developed over a 306,410-acre area over 30 years. It is envisaged to create some 1.3 million jobs and have a gross development value of RM640bil."

The new, third round of charges will keep Ghosn detained for longer as Japanese prosecutors pursue their case against the former global auto executive. Ghosn briefly won his freedom on bail in March, but was arrested and jailed again on new allegations of sending million of dollars from Nissan to accounts he controlled.

Another lengthy stay in prison, with limited access to his lawyers, could make it harder for him to prepare for a trial that may start later this year or next year. 

Ghosn, widely credited with saving Nissan from failure and bringing it together with Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., was first arrested in November, sending shockwaves across Japan, France and the global auto industry.

Ghosn has denied the charges against him, blaming them on a “a very dirty game” by Nissan executives who were determined to oust him from the alliance. Ghosn has vigorously denied other accusations of transferring personal trading losses to Nissan and under-reporting his income.

Earlier on Monday, Nissan filed a criminal complaint against Ghosn for his actions. 

The Yokohama-based automaker sent a statement to prosecutors saying that it determined that payments made by Nissan to an overseas vehicle sales company via a subsidiary “were in fact directed by Ghosn for his personal enrichment and were not necessary from a business standpoint,” Nissan said in a statement.

“Nissan is requesting appropriately strict penalties,” the automaker said in the statement. “Nissan takes this unfortunate situation very seriously and again expresses sincere regret for any concern caused to our valued stakeholders.”

When he was first jailed, Ghosn lost 15 pounds (7 kilograms) and underwent hours of questioning daily. Two of Ghosn’s daughters told the New York Times in December that his cell wasn’t heated, that he had asked repeatedly for blankets and that he had been denied pen and paper. Another extended stay could refocus international attention on the workings of Japan’s criminal justice system.

Nissan, which swiftly removed Ghosn as chairman days after his first arrest, is seeking to turn over a tumultuous chapter in its ties with Renault. The sudden detention of the former global auto titan threatened to derail their partnership, the world’s biggest auto alliance. 

Since then the three partners set up a new governance structure, led by Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, designed for smoother and more equitable decision-making. - Bloomberg"

The shares of Guan Chong Bhd . have soared more than 150 percent in the past year in Kuala Lumpur as profits doubled, making the producer of chocolate ingredients a top performer on the Bursa Malaysia Consumer Product Index. The MSCI All Country World Index of stocks is broadly flat in the past year.

For Chief Executive Officer Brandon Tay Hoe Lian, Asia’s biggest cocoa bean processor has been riding a wave of improved margins and higher sales. 

Net income doubled to 189.3 million ringgit ($45.8 million) last year, and 2019 “is looking as good as last year” because of increased capacity and sustained margins, he said in an interview last week.

“We’ve been experiencing strong demand since last year,” Tay said, which has helped the company increase the amount of forward sales. 

People are munching more dark chocolate, seen as an healthier alternative to ordinary snacks, and that’s boosting demand for cocoa, and exacerbating market tightness because of limited supplies of beans in Asia.

Shares of Guan Chong jumped almost 4 percent on Monday to 3.84 ringgit, and headed for the highest close on record.  

Going forward, Tay wants to move his processing plants closer to the bean-growing regions as he seeks to double grinding capacity over the next decade. That could mean venturing thousands of miles away to Africa or South America as bean production declines in Malaysia and Indonesia, he said.

“I can have additional expansion either in the bean-supply area or the customer area,” Tay said. 

“For us, the tendency is to go where the beans are. It’s a bit adventurous and some are reluctant to go, but then you’ll miss the chance,” he said. 

The world’s top producers are Ivory Coast and Ghana, and Tay said African countries are “quite encouraging in terms of tax incentives. We’ve been studying here and there but it’s not concrete.”

Capacity Surge
The business is driven by demand for powder, and that will determine whether the company expands or not, Tay said. “If there’s a chance for us, if the customer base growing and the so-called margins are sustained, we will grow.”

Guan Chong began as a family business in the early 1980s in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The company has expanded processing facilities over the years and has a capacity now of 250,000 tons, making it one of the world’s top grinders after Barry Callebaut AG, Cargill Inc. and Olam International Ltd.

Cocoa bean processing in Asia jumped almost 10 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to data last week from the Cocoa Association of Asia.

Internet subscribers grew to 80% of Digi's 11.3 million subscriber base. ARPU slipped RM1 to RM39 due to seasonal effect and changes in subscriber mix.

Meanwhile, cost of goods sold dropped 19.1% y-o-y due to seasonally lower device volume in transition to the enhance PF365 programme and reduction in regulated interconnect rate, said Digi.

Opex declined 0.4% y-o-t to RM490mil due to improved efficiencies in sales and marketing and operations and maintenance.

Ebitda moderated 6.7% y-o-y to RM723mil due to shift in prepaid mix and the seasonally lower device volume, while Ebitda margin increased to 48%.

Nine firms have said they plan to raise a combined 40.5 billion yuan ($6 billion) through rights issues since January, almost twice the amount announced all of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

That includes Tianqi Lithium Corp. and Xinjiang Tianrun Dairy Co., whose shares slumped 5.4 percent and 10 percent immediately after their respective announcements.

Chinese companies face restrictions on how much, how often and at what price they can sell new shares through private placements, the hitherto most popular method to raise money via the equity market. 

That’s sent them on a hunt for alternative funding tools, making the most of this year’s surging risk appetite. A rights issue, while subject to some of the same regulatory hurdles, allows for more freedom on pricing.

“Rights issues are the most effective way of equity refinancing at the moment due to strict restrictions on private placements,” said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities Co. “For the stock market, it’s never good news whenever refinancing shows up.”

LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. invited existing shareholders earlier this month to buy new shares at a discount of about 80 percent. 

That’s even though Chinese equities entered a bull market. While companies may also opt to raise funds through a public placement, it’s a tool that’s still rarely used because issuers aren’t permitted to offer big discounts.

The surge in rights issues has underscored the dilemma facing the nation’s leaders as they seek to improve financing conditions for the private sector without jeopardizing the sustained rally in the stock market. 

The curbs on private placement were put in place in 2017, when new listings were picking up pace, alarming regulators that they may drag down the stock market by adding supply.

The Shanghai Composite Index has risen more than 30 percent this year through last Friday, the best-performing stock market in the world. The gauge weakened 0.7 percent as of 11:09 a.m. local time on Monday, as investors turned cautious after China’s latest politburo meeting hinted that future policies may be less stimulative.

Some analysts warn the issuance could be a temporary drag on the equity market. Existing investors with no plans to participate in the offering prefer to sell their holdings rather than have their stake diluted, according to Kaiyuan’s Yang.

The flood of issuance elsewhere -- including 207 billion yuan of convertible bonds and more than 80 applications to list on Shanghai’s new tech board -- have also raised concerns over whether there’s enough money in the equity market to go around.

”Rights issuance will continue to increase,” said Kaiyuan’s Yang. “The market is still recovering moderately and the volume of refinancing is generally acceptable.” - Bloomberg"

Under the bank’s next five-year blueprint, Forward23, CIMB has set aside RM2 billion for improvement in the Technology and Data segment.

Group chief executive officer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz said following the size of capital expenditure this year, the group is anticipating a flat return on equity (ROE) growth for FY19.

“However, (the ROE growth) would be better than 2018, and will be around 12 per cent this year,” he told reporters after the bank’s 62nd annual general meeting here today.

Meanwhile, commenting on the stock market, Zafrul said the bank is still upbeat on the full-year performance of Bursa Malaysia, with the bank planning for at least three initial public offering (IPO) launches this year versus none in 2018.

Tengku Zafrul said the IPO launches would be from the consumer and infrastructure segments.

“I also hope that positive announcements on the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and Bandar Malaysia project continuation could stimulate companies in these sectors and at the same time boost the capital market,” he added.

He noted that market correction, in terms of cash flow related to emerging markets as well as the knee-jerk reaction from FTSE Russell’s warning that it may drop Malaysian debt from the World Government Bond Index, has triggered the current capital market cash outflow.

“Performance in the bond market is still positive despite the recent sell-offs, which only happened recently, and I believe after (FTSE Russell’s) engagement with Bank Negara Malaysia, the government and players, they will have a clearer view on the country’s performance,” he explained.   

He said the current situation is a normal market scenario, although he indicated that investors would remain cautious and be on the sidelines ahead of the FTSE Russell decision in September.  

“They (FTSE Russell) also need to take into consideration that Malaysia’s bond market is very deep, and in the worst case scenario, if they decide to take Malaysia out of the index, there are still other benchmarks that investors should refer to, a true benchmark that reflects Malaysia’s position,” he said.  

On Bank Negara Malaysia’s Overnight Policy Rate, he said contrary to market expectations, CIMB is expecting no cut in the rate.  

Most market players are projecting a 25 basis point cut following the Monetary Policy Committee meeting scheduled for May 6-7.

The Shanghai Composite Index has risen almost 30 percent this year, the biggest gain among more than 90 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg.

 Inflows are expected to increase after MSCI Inc. said it will more than quadruple the weighting of China-listed equities in a benchmark index.

Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission is also discussing with Chinese authorities the possibility of dual-listed exchange-traded funds in China. 

But an ETF Connect is proving difficult to build, Christina Choi, SFC executive director and head of the investment products division, said last year. She cited issues including differences in cross-border settlement systems and operating timings.-  Bloomberg"

Under the bank's next five-year blueprint, Forward23, CIMB has set aside RM2 billion for improvement in the Technology and Data segment.

Group chief executive officer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz said following the size of capital expenditure this year, the group is anticipating a flat return on equity (ROE) growth for FY19.

“However, (the ROE growth) would be better than 2018, and will be around 12 per cent this year,” he told reporters after the bank's 62nd annual general meeting here on Monday.

Meanwhile, commenting on the stock market, Zafrul said the bank is still upbeat on the full-year performance of Bursa Malaysia, with the bank planning for at least three initial public offering (IPO) launches this year versus none in 2018.

Tengku Zafrul said the IPO launches would be from the consumer and infrastructure segments.

“I also hope that positive announcements on the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and Bandar Malaysia project continuation could stimulate companies in these sectors and at the same time boost the capital market,” he added.

He noted that market correction, in terms of cash flow related to emerging markets as well as the knee-jerk reaction from FTSE Russell's warning that it may drop Malaysian debt from the World Government Bond Index, has triggered the current capital market cash outflow.

“Performance in the bond market is still positive despite the recent sell-offs, which only happened recently, and I believe after (FTSE Russell's) engagement with Bank Negara Malaysia, the government and players, they will have a clearer view on the country's performance,” he explained.   

He said the current situation is a normal market scenario, although he indicated that investors would remain cautious and be on the sidelines ahead of the FTSE Russell decision in September.  

“They (FTSE Russell) also need to take into consideration that Malaysia's bond market is very deep, and in the worst case scenario, if they decide to take Malaysia out of the index, there are still other benchmarks that investors should refer to, a true benchmark that reflects Malaysia's position,” he said.  

On Bank Negara Malaysia's Overnight Policy Rate, he said contrary to market expectations, CIMB is expecting no cut in the rate.  

Most market players are projecting a 25 basis point cut following the Monetary Policy Committee meeting scheduled for May 6-7.  

CIMB has maintained the country's economy growth forecast at between 4.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent this year, with the ringgit to strengthen to 4.10 against the US dollar compared with the current 4.1365-level. - Bernama"

The Shenzhen-based firm, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, also said its net profit margin was around 8 percent for the quarter, which it added was slightly higher than the same period last year. Huawei did not disclose its actual net profit.

The limited results announcement comes at a time when Washington has intensified a campaign against unlisted Huawei, alleging its equipment could be used for espionage and urging U.S. allies to ban it from building next-generation 5G mobile networks.

Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations and launched an unprecedented media blitz by opening up its campus to journalists and making its typically low-key founder, Ren Zhengfei, available for media interviews.

The Chinese firm, which is also the world's No. 3 smartphone maker, said last week the number of contracts it has won to provide 5G telecoms gear increased further despite the U.S. campaign.

By the end of March, Huawei said it had signed 40 commercial 5G contracts with carriers, shipped more than 70,000 5G base stations to markets around the world and expects to have shipped 100,000 by May.

Huawei's network business saw its first drop in revenue in two years in 2018. But Ren Zhengfei said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month that network equipment sales rose 15 percent while sales of the consumer business increased by more than 70 percent in the first quarter.

""These figures show that we are still growing, not declining,"" Ren said.

Guo Ping, rotating chairman of the company, has said he expects all three business groups - consumer, carrier and enterprise - to post double-digit growth this year.

Huawei also said on Monday it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter. It did not disclose year-ago comparable figures, but according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Huawei shipped 39.3 million smartphones in the first quarter of 2018. - Reuters"

Syed Zainal Abidin said at the service centre, customers can be assured of efficiency and attention from specially trained mechanics utilising the latest tools and technology to conduct vehicle inspection, engine diagnostics and oil changes.

""We want customers to experience the difference at this service centre, where we offer services under one roof, from vehicle inspection right up to tyre changes,” he said, adding the centre also offers Petronas products including premium engine oils that are acknowledged as the best at protecting engines.

An office tower will be the largest component of the Guoco Midtown project with 770,000 square feet spread across 30 floors. 

The residential portion will include a 32-story tower with about 200 apartments while the retail offering will be spread over 32,290 square feet, the company said Monday as it unveiled its concept for the site. The development should be complete by 2022.

Developers in the city-state are increasingly opting for mixed-use developments as the government seeks to boost living  spaces within the CBD. 

A draft plan released last month showed authorities propose to increase the number of residential developments and hotels by encouraging firms to convert existing office space. 

The added incentives for conversion will specifically target older-style buildings around central areas such as Anson Road, Cecil Street, Shenton Way and Tanjong Pagar.

GuocoLand successfully bid for the plot in 2017 after coughing up S$1.62 billion -- the highest price per square foot for land in the city at the time. 

The total development cost includes the land purchase price. Located at the northern edge of Singapore’s business district, the plot is bordered by Beach Road, Nicoll Highway and Rochor Road. - Bloomberg"

China will maintain policy support for the economy, which still faces ""downward pressure"" and difficulties after better-than-expected first-quarter growth, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party said on Friday.

But it also said authorities will try to strike a balance between stabilising economic growth, promoting reforms and controlling risks.

It added that China will push forward structural deleveraging and prevent speculation in the property market, suggesting attention may be turning back to debt risks that any further substantial stimulus measures may create.

The statement from the politburo came two days after China reported a steady 6.4 percent annual growth in January-March, defying expectations for a further slowdown, as industrial production jumped sharply and consumer demand showed signs of improvement. While analysts cautioned it was too early to call a turnaround, some market watchers lowered their expectations of further support measures.

The trend of marginal tightening in China's monetary policy is quite clear, as the politburo mentioned ""structural deleveraging"" again and as the central bank drained liquidity via open market operations recently, said Shanxi Securities in report.

Corrections would happen going forward as the stock market returns to rationality, the brokerage added.

Investors still need to wait for the best time to buy stocks, as the pace of money flowing into the stock market could slow in the short-term due to Beijing's counter-cyclical adjustments, CITIC Securities wrote in note.

It is going to be an important week just for direction.”Refinitiv data shows analysts expect the first year-over-year earnings decline since 2016. As of Thursday morning, they see profits declining 1.7%.Rapidly sliding expectations for second-quarter profit growth have sparked concerns about an earnings recession. Right now estimates are for growth of 2.1% in the second quarter, down from the 6.5% increase at the start of the year and 9.2% on Oct 1.“That is the big question hanging over this thing, is this really an earnings recession?” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.Forrest said that while some companies have been able to hold the line on earnings due to their ability to control costs, investors would rather see earnings growing on consumer strength.Refinitiv data shows 77 S&P 500 companies have reported, with 77.9% topping expectations, compared to the 65% beat rate since 1994 and the 76% over the past four quarters.But in a recent note to clients, Morgan Stanley US equity strategist Michael Wilson said that while companies are likely to beat ”the significantly lowered bar” for the first quarter, they believe it won’t be the trough for the year.Wilson noted with the S&P 500 now near the top of their valuation range with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8, there is not much upside remaining without a resurgence in growth that the market currently anticipates.That return to growth has also been cast into doubt by the less than enthusiastic picture being painted by corporate outlooks. The current ratio of negative to positive preannouncements stands at 2.7, well above the 1.5 average over the past four quarters but in line with the long-term average dating to 1997.And while that number is elevated over the past year, some view last year’s results as being positively affected by tax reform and at a level that is unsustainable this year.“It is just a return to the normal, what we are used to seeing, in this quarter,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research.Should results next week push earnings season further towards an earnings recession, that may still not derail the market, which was able to recover from the last one in 2016 that was fuelled in part by worries about a China slowdown.“Even if we were to get an earnings recession, to me that is not the end of the world, because comparisons are so strong from the year before and we’ve been through earnings recessions before and recovered,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.“We came out of that once we all got comfortable with the idea China’s economy was growing once again and we are sort of in a similar situation this time around.” — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/more-meaningful-brands/,More meaningful brands,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: In the wake of global economic uncertainties, consumers are using their buying power to make a stand. And the   power of consumers to impact change is greater than ever.In Malaysia for example, it was revealed that a whopping 63% of consumers believe brands actually have a more important role than the government to create a better future. This was higher than the global percentage of 55%. These were among some of the recent findings that were revealed by the Havas Group’s global Meaningful Brands 2019.Elaborating on the role of branding, Havas Media Malaysia CEO Andreas Vogiatzakis told StarBiz: “There is no doubt about it. It’s no longer enough to produce products that work. Brands need to have a purpose beyond product, they need to share something more with people, be part of their daily lives in order to drive a meaningful engagement. We know that meaningful engagement also drives better business results. “In the last 10 years, brands that are considered meaningful outperformed others on all major KPIs from consideration to loyalty rates,” .  He added that content is falling massively short of consumer expectations. While 90% of consumers expect brands to provide content, he said more than half the content from brands is not meaningful to consumers, drowned out by content noise, including 473, 000 tweets sent and 4m videos watched on YouTube, every minute. Tracking the relationship between a brand’s performance, its meaningfulness and the content it produces, Vogiatzakis said the Meaningful Brands survey showed brands urgently need to ramp up the effectiveness of their content to engage with people and boost business returns.  It revealed that 72% correlation between content effectiveness and a brand’s impact on personal well-being. “The greater the impact on making us happier, the more meaningful a brand becomes – being meaningful is definitely good for business,” he stressed.The best performing industries in Malaysia, according to Havas Content Effectiveness Index are automobiles, consumer electronics, travel and tourism, consumer goods and food. Automotive brands deliver excellent content that helps and informs (customer support and vehicle comparison data), and entertains (test-drives, sponsorship, VIP and virtual experiences). Electronics’ brands contribute positively to consumer’s quality of life, through functional, social and organisational benefits as they are enablers of experiences.  Elaborating on content, Vogiatzakis noted that content must bring value to the consumer, first and foremost and to be meaningful, content has to be tailored to the industry. He said: “As a network, our mission is to create meaningful content, connecting people and brands in new and engaging ways. Additionally, our Vivendi parentage help brands create and distribute new forms of valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and most importantly, retain audiences – and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action,’’ added Vogiatzakis.Vivendi SA is a French mass media conglomerate headquartered in Paris and owns the Havas Group. In terms of brands, Maybank, Toyota, Panasonic (Home Electronics) are the top three brands in the Meaningful Brands survey  rankings while Google, PayPal, Gillette and Johnson & Johnson make the list for global rankings. Another interesting point that was highlighted in the survey was the fact that meaningful brands outperform the stock market by 134%. In comparing local and global brands, Vogiatzakis said Malaysians love their brands more than their global counterparts.  “Malaysians would not care if 69% of the brands simply disappeared. This is relative to people globally, who would not care if 77% of the brands disappeared,” he added.He noted that Malaysian consumers trust companies and brands more than their global counterparts. For example, the survey showed that 61% of the Malaysians believe that companies and brands indeed communicate honestly about their commitments and promises compared to the global figure of only 34%.The Meaningful Brands 2019 survey is a global study created by Havas Group comprising of 1800 brands, in 31 countries (including Malaysia), with 350,000 respondents. The study links brand performance to the quality of life and well-being."

Despite widespread recognition of the utility of digital services, a range of basic, self-fulfilment, psychological and societal needs are failing to be met. Alongside a growing distrust of digital technology, this is prompting consumers to take back control of their digital experience, with significant implications for business.The research, conducted in partnership with Oxford Economics and surveying over 43,000 people, measures performance in 24 countries across the dimensions of dynamism, inclusion and trust.Commenting on the research, DAN Asia-Pacific executive chairman Takaki Hibino said: “For Asia, this year’s Digital Society Index presents a tale of two halves. There’s great optimism about the future of technology and its ability to solve the world’s most pressing challenges. At the same time people’s trust in technology is waning and concerns about the pace of technological change are mounting.“It’s no longer a question that people need to be at the heart of the digital economy. However, there’s still a long way to go in meeting the digital needs of many. If this aspect is not fulfilled, innovation will always fail. The report calls for a more balanced approach to engage people through digital products and services – to truly grasp the opportunities presented by technology.”Across Asia Pacific, there is a gap between the promise of digital technologies and its human impact. Fifty-six per cent are optimistic that digital technologies will have a positive impact on society but they’re concerned that the pace of change is too fast.People are also worried about technology’s impact on their well-being and quality of life as only 28% agreed that technology fulfils their psychological needs. Nevertheless, they continue to embrace digital products and services, with 55% more likely to book taxis with an app and 81% more likely to shop online.People are also becoming increasingly mindful of data management, taking steps to reduce the amount of data shared online for instance. Eight out of 10 say they would stop doing business with an organisation that misused their data, representing the most prominent driver of distrust.Critically for businesses, those consumers most active in taking back control of their online data and time, in ways that will make it harder for brands to engage them, are also those with the highest propensity to use digital products and services.Trends identified from the findings carry significant implications for brands and businesses and the report includes a series of recommendations such as:> Businesses need to compete on openness and transparency around data usage.

The anticipated increase is based on the continued confidence of customers investing in ASNB products as well as the convenience provided through Maybank’s digital channels, allowing them to enjoy the benefits in terms of speed with minimum documents required. Maybank’s head of community financial services Malaysia, Datuk Hamirullah Boorhan said in a statement that  “MSAM events serve as an ideal avenue for the public to understand more about saving for the future and the various investment options available in the market. “Today, with the wide range of products we offer including those by ASNB, as well as the availability of investing via digital channels, customers can enjoy the benefit of obtaining sufficient information on how to invest smartly based on their risk appetite,” he added.In the first three months of this year, the group has garnered a total of over RM6.1bil of ASNB investments. “We are hoping to record over RM25bil of ASNB investments by the close of the year,” said Hamirullah.   At the event, Maybank also launched its online application service for ASB financing which is available via the Maybank App. With this new service, existing customers will be able to apply for ASB financing on-the-go. Non-existing customers can also apply via the Maybank App but will need to visit the branch for verification purposes.“In line with our aim of becoming the digital bank of choice, we continue to offer our customers new digital conveniences that will improve the way they plan their finances. “The online application service for ASNB unit trusts via the Maybank App provides them the avenue to view and apply for investment products to suit their needs. On top of that, they will now be able to apply online for financing if they wish to increase their investments,” he pointed out.   Maybank is also showcasing a range of other savings and financial planning products including its own unit trusts, Insurance and takaful protection products, will writing, deposit products as well as providing financial advisory services at MSAM 2019."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/independence-of-central-banks-in-question/,Independence of central banks in question,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"RUMBLINGS of concern over central bank independence have erupted into full-blown debates on attempts by populist leaders to influence decision-making at central banks.Certainly worried about central bank independence is European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, who in a rare move, voiced his concern “in the most important jurisdiction in the world”.Long considered the global role model for central banks especially in terms of apolitical policy-making, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is under attack by President Donald Trump for having “mistakenly raised interest rates”.The Fed had raised rates nine times since 2015, the last seven during Trump’s presidency.After the sugar rush from short-term US fiscal stimulus, which was accompanied by rapid rate hikes, there are calls for rate cuts and re-flooding of markets with monetary stimulus called quantitative easing.On top of that, a global slowdown triggered by a trade war between the United States and China, which is threatening to spill over to the European Union, has dented confidence and business sentiment.Cries for help now converge on the Fed, which increasingly looks like a political punchbag, with Trump even wanting to nominate those who are aligned to him onto the board.There are other leaders in this populist assault on central banks, said The Washington Post.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had issued a presidential decree last year that allowed him to directly appoint central bank leaders.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has succeeded in finding a central bank governor who could, apparently, help him in the ongoing elections; he has cut rates twice.In the Philippines, the newly-appointed head of the central bank is regarded to be a close political ally to the president.The leadership of the Bank of Italy is under attack by the ruling coalition which is also questioning the bank’s stewardship of US$100bil of gold reserves.In South Africa, there are upcoming changes possibly in the structure and ownership of the central bank which has been private and “fiercely autonomous”.The Fed may have been too aggressive in raising rates but constant hammering of this influential central bank could erode its credibility and affect the value of the dollar, a popular global currency.Investors’ perception of a strong central bank may change if it is felt that the bank is operating on short-term plans to juice the economy and to boost re-election chances.The concern is that political considerations may prevent central bankers from doing their job to pierce bubbles where historically, the mopping up of burst bubbles had been messy.We need no reminder that the bursting of the subprime bubble had nearly triggered a financial Armageddon worldwide between 2007 and 2009.The real estate bubble in the 2000s was fuelled largely by easy mortgage approvals; home prices had begun tumbling in certain parts of the United States in 2006, and by 2008, there was a full-blown economic meltdown.Banks that had too much money tied to securities backed by these shaky loans, went bust.The earlier bursting of the huge dotcom bubble in 2000 had led to the recession in 2001.The bubble that was formed by the dotcom stockmarket surge from 1995, was fed by easy money, exuberance and  speculation on future earnings.Over the five years, the Nasdaq exploded from under 1,000 to above 5,000; the crash saw the Nasdaq tumble 77% from its peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to 1,139.90 on Oct 4, 2002.In the recession that followed the tech sell-off, the Bay Area in California which was home to Silicon Valley, the global centre for high technology, saw the highest unemployment rates in decades.There is currently a bubble on Wall Street that needs to be pricked but slowing growth is prompting a pause in rate hikes and calls for rate cuts.This dilemma partly arises from the Fed having kept rates too low for too long.“By the time the concurrent data showed a boom was in full swing, it would not raise rates and when it did move, the economy had gone into a speculative stage.“Then, the Fed kept raising rates. By the time it saw evidence of the effects of its rate hikes and stopped, a slowdown cycle was already firmly set in place,’’ said Pong Teng Siew, head of research, Inter-Pacific Securities.While central banks should not compromise on their independence in ensuring financial and price stability, the timing and accuracy of their actions is important.“If they are behind or ahead of the curve, it can lead to unwarranted effects on the economy,’’ said Lee Heng Guie, executive director, Socio Economic Research Center.Columnist Yap Leng Kuen notes that central banks must be independent and also make the right moves."

STC is also among the largest manufacturers of industrial lighting in Southeast Asia.  For the financial year ended June 30, 2018, 78% of the group’s revenue was derived from the transformer & lighting division, with the remainder from its process equipment segment.  The research house projects STC to record a three-year (FY18 to FY21) earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 31.5%, to be driven by better economies of scale as well as higher sales of street lighting locally and overseas, given STC’s superior products and required accreditations in place."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/fed-officials-contemplate-thresholds-for-rate-cut/,Fed officials contemplate thresholds for rate cuts,Banking,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",8:08 AM MYT,"FEDERAL Reserve officials are starting to talk about the conditions under which they would cut interest rates, including a scenario where inflation drifts lower even if the economic growth doesn’t falter.Such a scenario isn’t seen as particularly likely, and a rate cut isn’t imminent or under consideration for their meeting April 30-May 1. But the thresholds for such action have been a topic of conversations in recent interviews and public remarks.Inflation rose last year to the Fed’s 2% target after years of undershooting it. Central bank officials say the target is symmetric, meaning they expect inflation will drift mildly above and below it at different times.Price pressures softened beginning last fall, although officials had expected inflation to keep rising amid strong hiring and a burst of fiscal stimulus fueled by tax cuts and government spending.If inflation runs too far below 2% for a while, it would show “our setting of monetary policy is actually restrictive, and we need to make an adjustment down in the funds rate,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Monday,  referring to the central bank’s benchmark federal-funds rate."

Stephen Innes, managing partner and head of trading at SPI Asset Management said on Monday the “decisive economic pivot in China suggesting global growth headwinds are easing and factoring in a possible US-China trade deal, so over the long haul we should expect the Ringgit to remain supported”.

In his note to clients he expects the ringgit to piggy-back on the strengthening yuan as a China economic resurgence will have a prosperous effect across all Asean economies.

To recap, the ringgit came under pressure following the move by the Norwegian sovereign fund to exit Malaysian bonds coupled with the FTSE Russell possible exclusion.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, had announced it was streamlining its US$300bil fixed-income portfolio by cutting emerging market bonds from the benchmark index it tracks,

Investors were worried over the potential exclusion of the nation’s bonds from the FTSE World Government Bond Index, 

Innes said on Monday these factors provided a significant technical overhang for the ringgit, and when factoring a dovish Bank Negara Malaysia backdrop, it suggests the ringgit will struggle for traction and could trade with a weaker short-term bias. 

He also said foreign outflows related to Norges shifting away from EM bonds and WGBI potentially dropping Malaysia from the index perhaps got the markets nudging to the 4.15 level a bit quicker than expected. 

“The  Norges and Russel shocker aside, markets are positioning for a benign inflation print this week that should lend support to a growing chorus of calls for the Bank Negara to drop interest rates next month,” he said.
Innes pointed out that in the absence of a robust offshore ringgit market, liquidity can dry up quickly especially when foreign investors are all running for that small exit at the same time. 
“Bid to offer spreads increases dramatically which tends to exaggerate currency moves. This phenomenon is what occurred last week as Malay bonds repriced on panic fear which caused currency traders to price in a substantial premium for possible outflows. 
“But given the macro policy backdrop remain supportive, the market faded the bond market move which in turn stabilised the ringgit.

 “Nonetheless, we remain short term bearishly biased on the  ringgit as the writing does appear to be on the wall. Bank Negara has revised growth forecasts lower, benign inflation is the new norm, while the definite shift in central bank rhetoric adds more enthusiasm to the chances for a rate cut next month,” he said."

""We do not expect the 5G rollout to lift the telcos’ capex significantly, judging from South Korea’s recent 5G rollout,"" it said, while maintaining its neutral rating on the sector.

It added that for telco investors, the factors to watch for include the timing of the spectrum allocation, fees and capex.

""The Malaysian government has yet to announce the spectrum band to be allocated for 5G - the 3.5GHz band is currently use for the satellite communications. 

""Separately, we expect the allocation of 700MHz spectrum to take place by end-2019,"" it said.

While MCMC chairman Al-Ishsal Ishak has said that the government has no plans to profit from the award of the 5G specrum, Affin Hwang believes that competition among the telcos, global trend and federal government's plan to reduce budget deficits may still weigh on the spectrum fees.

“Within our coverage, IJM Corp, Sunway (via Sunway Construction) and WCT Holdings are potential beneficiaries of the affordable housing scopes, although we believe they will be highly selective in their bids. 

“New construction works in Bandar Malaysia will also benefit building material players over the longer run,” it said on Monday.  
  
Last Friday, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) announced that the government has decided to reinstate the Bandar Malaysia project.

 The 483-acre Bandar Malaysia project (located on the site of the former Sungai Besi Air Force base) is estimated to generate RM140bil in gross development value (GDV) while attracting foreign direct investments. 

It is positioned as a niche urban development covering residential, commercial, office, leisure and rail transit-oriented development (TOD). 

The initial phase of the project will feature the construction of a people’s park and 10,000 units of affordable homes, with Bumiputera participation throughout the project and priority for local content in the construction process.     

“Similar to the East Coast Rail Line (ECRL), the Bandar Malaysia project is to be viewed within the larger context of fostering and cementing longer-term bilateral relations between Malaysia and China under the overall Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
“The government will honour the RM7.4bn sale of a 60% stake in Bandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd to IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd, which fell through in 2017. Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn Bhd (IWH) owns a 60% stake in the JV while China state-owned China Railway Engineering Corp. (CREC) owns the balance 40%,” the research house said. 
  
CIMB Research said IWH’s share of total acquisition cost amounts to RM4.4bil (60% stake) while CREC’s share works out to RM2.9bil. 

PMO’s announcement stated that the JV is to fork out RM1.2bil (original 10% deposit of RM741mil plus an additional RM500mil sum) within two months of this announcement.  

“We calculated that the 60% stake sale for RM7.4bil translates into a RM12.4bil valuation for the 483 -acre land,” it said.

CIMB Research said phase one of the development could take up 100-150 acres of land (20-30% of total and size) over five to 10 years.  

Assuming a general guideline of 10%-15% gross development cost (GDC) on the earlier estimated RM50bil to RM60bil gross development value (GDV), it roughly estimated that potential value of construction works could range from RM5bil to RM9bil.  

“While the return of Bandar Malaysia is a positive surprise in terms of potentially catalysing new construction works and as the number of affordable housing units in the project is doubled from 5,000 to 10,000, potential beneficiaries are likely limited to smaller/medium-sized building contractors for which tenders could be competitive.  

“The reinstatement of the Bandar Malaysia deal, in our view, does not suggest a revival of the KL-Singapore HSR (and the earlier planned terminus in Bandar Malaysia) as the latter is pending a review, with a decision due in May 2020,” it said."

The research house upgraded the counter to buy from neutral with an unchanged target price of RM1.76.

In a note, it said it met with IOI Properties' management, which suggested that there was no material explanation for the fall in the share price.

The group's most recent launch in Xiamen 2 in December 2018 was over 80% sold. In FY19 so far, the group has launched over RM400mil of projects in China, which have been well received.

Meanwhile, management is looking to roll out the Xiamen 3 project in Xiang An in mid-2019 if the market is ready for the pricing and product. 

RHB added that the group stands to be a beneficiary of the ECRL line and potentially the High Speed Rail (HSR) project if revived.

""With about 700 acres of development land around IOI Resort City, we think IOI Properties is a prime beneficiary of the railway network that will have a stop at Putrajaya Sentral. 

""These are the ECRL, ERL, and MRT2 (Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya line) that have already been allocated a stop at Putrajaya Sentral, which is 11-12 km away from the site,"" it said.

Assuming the HSR project is revived, the link could potentially have a stop at Putrajaya Sentral while IOI Properties owns more than 1,000 acres of land directly opposite the Ayer Keroh HSR station as per the original plan.

Near-term earnings growth should also be backed by IOI Properties' investment property assets, which make up over 20% of its total revenue, as compared to about 10% two years ago.

IOI Properties is currently constructing Phase 2 of IOI City Mall, which should have a net lettable area of one million sq ft to be completed in 2021/22.

The Prime Minister said the original contractors, which is a consortium consisting of Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Bhd and China Railway Engineering Corp Sdn Bhd (IWH-CREC), have 60 days to pay the original deposit sum of RM741mil with an additional RM500mil. 


In December 2015, the Finance Ministry sold off a 60% stake in Bandar Malaysia to a consortium consisting of Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Bhd and China Railway Engineering Corp Sdn Bhd to be the project's master developer.


In May 2017, however, the government called off the deal to sell the stake to the consortium over the failure of purchasing parties to fulfil payment obligations.


PublicInvest Research said the revival of Bandar Malaysia project came in as a positive surprise as it was being announced just a few days after the ECRL project. 


It noted that the project was subsequently retendered after the termination, though the process had been somewhat quiet after rounds of bids. 


In July last year, the ministry’s officials disclosed that there were “zero” developers who had expressed interest in the project. 


“Reinstatement of this project is an obvious shot-in-the-arm, particularly to the local construction sector.


“Given the greenfield nature of this project, players exposed to the initial infrastructure-based phases (access roads, earthworks, water and sewerage treatment plants, substantial piling works) could be sizeable opportunities,” PublicInvest said. 


“Within our universe, big names like Gamuda, IJM Corporation and WCT Holdings could be beneficiaries for the construction works.

“We view positively the revival of the Bandar Malaysia project that we believe signifies the return to normalcy of Malaysia-China relations. 

“This follows the recent revival of another Chinese-led project, i.e. the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, after the project turnkey contractor China Communications Construction Company Ltd agreed to cut the project cost by RM21.5bil to RM44bil from RM65.5bil,” it said.

AmInvest Research pointed out the key difference between the two is that in the ECRL’s instance, the government was held hostage by a termination penalty amounting to RM21.8bil, while in the case of Bandar Malaysia, the government was under no pressure whatsoever as the question of compensation never arose. 

To recap, in 2015, a 60:40 JV between Iskandar Waterfront Holdings (IWH) and China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) entered into an agreement with 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) for the purchase of a 60% stake in the 468-acre Bandar Malaysia project in Sungai Besi, Kuala Lumpur, for RM7.41bil.

“We believe the market is caught by surprise (and caught short) by Putrajaya’s sudden departure from its more ‘restrictive’ views towards Chinese businesses following the change in power post-14th general election (GE14),” it said.

AmInvest Research believes the Malaysia-China relations already hit the bottom in August 2018 when Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad proposed a ban on foreign purchases of properties in Forest City, a US$100bil (RM410bil) property project comprising four man-made islands with a total area of 3,425 acres at the southern tip of Johor, developed by Chinese property giant Country Garden. 

“We believe accelerated foreign direct investment (FDI) from Chinese businesses (or the expectations of this happening at some point alone) shall stabilise the stock market, ringgit and business/consumer sentiments, and hence the economy, if not lifting them out of the doldrums at present. 

“The latest development could not have come at a more critical time,” it said.

The research house said there have been concerns on capital flight from Malaysia following the recent decision by the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund to reduce its exposure to emerging market bonds (which could result in an outflow from Malaysian bonds estimated at US$1.9bil or RM7.8bil).

There was also apprehension and the news on the FTSE Russell putting Malaysia on the watch list with a view to excluding it from the FTSE World Government Bond Index (which could trigger an outflow of  Malaysian Government Securities to the tune of US$8bil or RM32.8bil).

“The revival of Bandar Malaysia alone could immediately bolster the government’s coffers by RM1.24bil, being RM7.41bil deposit plus RM500mil advance payment. The full settlement of the purchase consideration (of which the time frame is still unknown at present) could bring in another RM6.17bil,” it said. 

The key sectors that will be impacted by the Bandar Malaysia revival are:  

1. Property (Negative): This massive integrated development will add more floor space to the already over-supplied residential, commercial, office and retail segments in the Klang Valley. 

The saving grace is Bandar Malaysia may stimulate new demand if it is able to, as advertised, “draw major international financial institutions, multi-national corporations and Fortune 500 Companies to locate their regional headquarters” there, including “(Chinese) tech giants such as Alibaba and Huawei”. Private developers may face tremendous competition from the proposed 10,000 affordable homes in Bandar Malaysia given the units’ strategic location, public transport connectivity and potentially subsidised pricing; 
 
2. Building Materials (Positive): The project will stimulate demand for cement and steel, of which the extent will depend on how aggressive Bandar Malaysia rolls out its launches; and 
 
3. Construction (Positive): The local participation requirements will ensure that Malaysian construction companies get a fair share of Bandar Malaysia’s construction works. 

However, it wasmindful that not many local contractors have worked with Chinese main contractors before, and if their experience in time will be a fruitful one.

AmInvest Research said it was more inclined to want to look beyond the sectors in its analysis for the revival of Bandar Malaysia. It believes investors should instead focus on how the improved Malaysia-China ties could help bring down the market risk premium, resulting in multiple expansion for the market.

In its weekly fund flow, MIDF said last week’s outflow of RM433.4mil was the largest weekly foreign outflow in six weeks. 


“International investors were net sellers throughout the week, extending the daily foreign net selling streak to seven days as of last Friday,” the research house said.  


Bursa began the quarter with a rather sour note as foreign funds took out almost RM100mil on Monday despite waning concerns of the U.S-China trade war following the strong recovery in China’s exports which grew 14.2% year-on-year in March 2019.


MIDF said the level of foreign net selling dropped to RM38.2mil on Tuesday ahead of the release of China’s 1Q19 GDP. 


It was notable that the majority of North Asian peers namely, Taiwan and Korea saw foreign net inflows of above US$100mil.


There was an exodus of foreign funds on Wednesday to a tune of RM140.6mil as the optimism spurred by China’s 1Q19 GDP. 


This was weighed down by the possible exclusion of Malaysian debt from the FTSE World Government Bond Index which may lead to a US$8bil drain in Malaysa’s bond market.


Thursday saw a foreign net outflow of RM96.4mil net before declining further to RM59.8mil on Friday. 


On Friday, the government of Malaysia reinstated the Bandar Malaysia project, lifting the local bourse slightly by 0.1% to close at 1,622 points.


“The month of April has so far seen a foreign net outflow of RM1.14bil. This has brought the year-to-date foreign net outflow to RM2.50bil,” MIDF said. 


“Among the four Asean markets we monitor, Malaysia retains its position as the nation with the largest foreign net outflow.

“Meanwhile, amongst the seven Asian markets we track, India is the nation with the largest foreign net inflow worth more than US$8.5bil or RM30bil as the general election is still ongoing until May 2019,” it said."

Chen Siqing, chairman of Bank of China Ltd., was appointed as party secretary of Beijing-based ICBC at an internal meeting on Monday, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. 

Chen is replacing Yi Huiman, who became chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country’s top securities regulator, in January.

Chen is expected to also be named ICBC’s chairman, a position that has traditionally been held by the same person who has served as party secretary, according to the people. 

The bank had $4.1 trillion of total assets at the end of 2018.

The reshuffle adds to a string of management changes at China’s top financial institutions and regulators. Peng Chun, chairman of Bank of Communications Co. was appointed head of China’s $941 billion sovereign wealth fund earlier this month, while Liu Guiping, vice mayor of the southwestern city of Chongqing, was named president of China Construction Bank Corp. in March. 

China has yet to fill the chairmen positions at Bank of China and Bank of Communications, the nation’s fourth and fifth largest lenders.

The press office of ICBC wasn’t immediately available for comment.

ICBC reported a record profit of 297.7 billion yuan ($44 billion) last year after policy makers renewed their push to spur credit amid a deepening economic slowdown.

At rival Bank of China, which generated more revenue from overseas operations than any of its domestic peers, earnings grew at the fastest pace since 2014 to 180.1 billion yuan.

ICBC currently operates 426 outlets in overseas markets with $384 billion of assets, or close to 10 percent of the group’s total.

Running China’s top banks does not come with a lavish pay package. Yi, former chairman of ICBC, earned about $100,250 last year, a fraction of the salaries taken home by JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s former CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

 China capped compensation for most senior executives at its biggest banks and other state-owned enterprises in 2015 as part of efforts to combat inequality.

Chen, born in 1960, joined Bank of China in 1990 and became its chairman in 2017. - Bloomberg"

Spritzer plans to start the upgrading exercise at the end of the year,” he added.Meanwhile, the group’s RM50mil automated warehouse in Taiping should be operational by early next year.“The new automated warehouse should help to improve our delivery system in the country,” he added.On new products, Spritzer will come up with new 250ml and 300ml mineral water bottles soon to further increase its market share, which is at about 40% currently.“There are no plans to add new production lines, as we have enough capacity to cater to the nationwide market for at least one year,” he said. Currently, the group has 16 production lines producing over 700 million litres a year, compared with 15 production lines and 650 million litres in 2018. .Spritzer is also a beneficiary of the heatwave that is enveloping the country.“The sales in March increased as a result of the heatwave, and we should see rising sales in April also, should the situation prolong,” Lim noted. On its overseas business, the group is interested to grow the contribution from exports, which generate about 10% of the revenue.“Our products are sold in Guangzhou, where we have a sales division, the UK, Brunei, Singapore and Hong Kong,” he said.According to a Grand View Research report, the global bottled water market size is expected to reach US$215.12bil by 2025. “The market is estimated to register a compounded annual growth rate of 7.4% during the forecast period. “It is anticipated to witness higher growth as compared to carbonated drinks on account of better health benefits and added nutrients. “Factors such as an increase in the per capita spending and rapid urbanisation are likely to fuel the demand for bottled water over the forecast period,” the report said.According to the report, Asia Pacific is likely to be the dominant regional market for bottled water over the forecast period. “Rising population, coupled with rapid urbanisation in countries such as India, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia, is likely to be the key driver for the market,” the report added."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/rate-cut-may-not-save-ringgit-bond-rally-as-index-outflow-looms/,Rate cut may not save ringgit bond rally as index outflow looms,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: A storm is brewing for Malaysian bonds as the threat of an US$8bil (RM33bil) outflow and a falling ringgit erode sentiment, even in the face of a likely interest-rate cut.The biggest rally in ringgit bonds in three years, fuelled by bets for policy easing, has ground to a halt. FTSE Russell sparked the latest – and perhaps biggest – worry when it said last week it may remove Malaysia from its world bond index on concern about market liquidity, triggering fears of a capital flight.The move couldn’t come at a worse time: the currency is lagging, global funds continue to sell Malaysian stocks and palm oil exports are under threat from European Union restrictions. While weak inflation data Wednesday could support the case for a rate cut, there are concerns consumer prices could rebound in the second half.“The bond market may be in for some volatility, if speculation increases over the country’s potential exclusion of the World Government Bond Index (WGBI),” said Anders Faergemann, a London-based senior money manager at Pinebridge Investments which oversees US$90bil. “We would not immediately step in to buy Malaysian local bonds in spite of rising prospects of a rate cut.”The upcoming inflation report may offer clues on the timing of any interest-rate cut. If data show consumer prices fell for a third month in March, bond traders could position for an easing to take place as early as the next review on May 7.“There is scope for Bank Negara to initiate a cut in the second half, reversing the 25 basis points hike of early 2018,” said State Street Global Markets macro strategist Dwyfor Evans. “But no more, given fears over resurgent inflation and rate differentials.”Inflation could soon rebound on higher oil prices, a weaker ringgit and base effects, he said.The prospects of a rate cut, and a revival of emerging markets, drove the country’s three-year bonds to their best quarter since 2016. Yields though have climbed in April, now hovering about 25 basis points above the policy rate of 3.25%. Ten-year bond yields have also risen.Investors are now bracing for an exodus in the event FTSE Russell does eliminate Malaysia from its WGBI in September. Outflows may total almost US$8bil if the nation is dropped, according to Morgan Stanley estimates based on index weighting and tracking data from the International Monetary Fund.Foreign holdings of Malaysian debt are already hovering near a two-year low. A massive withdrawal may also deal a knock-on blow to the nation’s equities, the world’s worst performing major stock market this year, given the historical correlation between local shares and the ringgit.The ringgit has lost about 1.3% so far in April, the most among Asian currencies, as global funds continued to trim holdings of Malaysian equities after pulling almost US$3bil last year.Still, even the threat of capital outflows is unlikely to prompt radical action from Bank Negara to address market liquidity, after their prohibition on trading in non-deliverable forwards in 2016 and subsequent measures to allow hedging.“It is unlikely that Bank Negara will change regulation drastically just because of this,” said Mingze Wu, a foreign-exchange trader at INTL FCStone Global Payments in Singapore. “If we do see changes in regulations, it won’t just be the FTSE downgrade being the main factor, but certainly it will nudge Bank Negara to the direction that market wants.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/payment-woes-for-contractors/,Payment woes for contractors,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The weak property market in recent years has resulted in a competitive tendering environment for building construction jobs, with some contractors willing to cut prices in their efforts to secure new jobs, said Master Builders Association Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee.“It is a very competitive tendering environment now. For some tenders, we see more than 100 contractors bidding and it impacts all levels of contractors.“Even big contractors are feeling the pinch and are tendering for jobs in lower-volume brackets just to tide over the challenging business environment,” Foo said in an email response to comments from building construction sources that contractors are willing to accept a small loss in order to secure job contracts.Last month, engineering and construction company Zelan Bhd  filed a statement with Bursa Malaysia initiating arbitration proceedings against NRY Architects for RM305.4mil and other contract breaches for the construction of buildings of International Islamic University Malaysia in Kuantan.A second Zelan statement to Bursa claimed RM3.34mil in outstanding payment for construction works from BBCC Development Sdn Bhd.BBCC Development is the project owner of the multi-billion-ringgit Bukit Bintang City Centre, a joint venture between Eco World Development Group Bhd , UDA Holdings Bhd and the Employees Provident Fund.Eco World disputed the claim.An industry source said one construction company does not sour the entire sector, but three other sources said building contractors are feeling the strain of the weak property market.A source said he personally knows of one which closed down a few years ago when the property market began to weaken in 2014.Another source said contractors would have to continue to play the game because of equipment purchased during the good times.This second industry source said: “Previously, they could make more money and now they have to cut down their profits. They have their overheads and margins. They cannot retract too much because when the job comes back, there are not enough workers. We don’t know where the economy is going.”MBAM’s Foo said the key is “to tender the price fairly”. Foo is also executive director of construction and civil engineers Mitrajaya Holdings Bhd .“If a contractor prices too low, he may have problems delivering the project at the end of the day,” Foo said.The weak property market has resulted in an oversupply of residential units which lack demand on two counts – they are located in places which lack demand because the surroundings lack facilities and infrastructure, or they are priced out of reach of the ordinary folk.The weak demand has resulted in developers putting the launch of new units on hold, or delaying their launches, impacting the building construction industry.The construction industry is generally divided between building construction and infrastructure. The infrastructure boys, according to industry sources, seem to be faring better.Foo said most contractors would have experienced delays and non-payment problems. He hopes contra arrangements, giving properties in exchange for payment, are not very high.“Contractors should be paid for work done – and not be paid in kind – to ease their cash flow,” he said. He said that as long as there are contractual arrangements and freedom between parties, contractors will continue to face payment issues.“These issues (late or delayed payment or contra arrangements) not only happen in the property development or the construction industry, but also in other industries.“This is part of the ‘occupational hazard’ and risk of the industry if you are unlucky to have a ‘slow payment’ or ‘non-payment’ client,” he said.Foo said MBAM has heard about such incidents “for quite some time”.“Sometimes, due to the prevailing market situation, contractors may have no choice but to accept payment in the form of properties and hopefully be able to dispose of them later and recover some of their money/payments. Sometimes, it might be due to contractual disputes,” he said.He said this situation of delays or payment in kind has come about due to cash-flow problems and other contractual-related reasons."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/why-gucci-and-dior-want-to-rebuild-notredame/,Why Gucci and Dior want to rebuild Notre-Dame,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"IF the fire at Notre-Dame cathedral had happened 20 or 50 years ago, France’s luxury fashion houses would surely have rushed to support its reconstruction as quickly as they did in 2019.There is no doubting the sincerity of LVMH, Kering SA and their founding families, who  led the way with donations after the devastation earlier last week. The city of Paris, its streets and landmarks, have held a special role as the artistic centre of the industry since its earliest days, so to restore what has been lost is to preserve its own history.But more than a century after Coco Chanel sold her first hat, the titans of luxury have even more reason to ensure Notre-Dame recovers.And it is not just that they are among the wealthiest in France – LVMH’s Bernard Arnault is France’s richest man and Francois Pinault, who created Kering SA, ranks third. L’Oreal SA and its principal shareholder, the Bettencourt Meyers family, are also key donors. Fashion generates 2.7% of French gross domestic product. Luxury, including L’Oreal, represents 19.8% of the CAC 40 index. With such a sizeable share of the nation’s business, it’s only natural that the leading producers of high-end goods would step up to preserve one of their country’s iconic locations. It’s important that they do, because selling high-end goods has changed over the past decade. The lines are blurring between fashion, art, travel and culture, and developing a brand depends on so much more than offering the latest It bag. Success means blending all these elements together, so there’s a drive to branch out.The big groups are already involved in  art and restoration. LVMH opened the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a Frank Gehry-designed centre for contemporary arts, on the western edge of Paris in 2016. Pinault, meanwhile, is building a museum to house his private art collection at the former Bourse de Commerce, in the centre of Paris. Notre-Dame is associated with heritage and beauty, values that resonate within the luxury industry. Preserving the cathedral burnishes donors’ position as a guardian of those characteristics, which in turn highlights the broader lifestyle they seek to promote. Landmark preservation fits well with this ethos. Fendi, part of the LVMH empire, contributed US$2mil to the repair of the Trevi fountain in Rome. Sister brand Bulgari donated US$1.7mil to overhaul the city’s Spanish Steps. Outside of the Arnault stable, Italian leather goods group Tod’s SpA has underwritten the US$28mil restoration of the Colosseum in Rome.Their altruism works best on high-profile sites that appeal to tourists as their donations also literally put their names on the map for the millions of visitors to key locations each year. Fendi even held a fashion show at the Trevi Fountain under the late Karl Lagerfeld. A restored Notre-Dame will be no different (though fashion shows may not be allowed).The real prize for the French houses is to assure their connection to the Chinese, who are the number one buyers of luxury goods globally. LVMH and Kering each generate about a third of their sales from Asia excluding Japan.Paris is one of the main destinations for travellers from this region, and anything that affects visits can also impact sales of luxury goods. For example, the 2015 tourist attacks on the city, and the recent yellow vest protests, hurt demand. On the other hand, a weaker euro can lift sales. For these companies, there is a special urgency to ensure that Paris is preserved.When Notre-Dame is finally rebuilt, donors will rightly be credited with rescuing a symbol of the city.They’ll also have created an even bigger draw for visitors. It makes good business sense for them to have taken part.  -- BloombergAndrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/keep-close-watch-on-household-debt/,Keep close watch on household debt,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The household debt level in the country still needs to be monitored closely as it could pose risks despite a steady decline after hitting its peak in 2015.The household debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio  has fallen from 88.4% in 2015 to 83% last year, but economists said it is still on the elevated side compared to regionally and could pose risks.As such, besides the existing measures, they agree other new measures should be put in place to improve household debt.AmBank Group chief economist Anthony Dass told StarBiz it is important to closely monitor the household debt to GDP trend as risk could emerge from the more leveraged borrowers who have taken loans to purchase higher valued properties and for personal use. “Those borrowers who are more dependent on variable income and also those under the lower-income bracket and living in urban areas are more likely to face greater challenges servicing their debt. “So, there is risk for household debt to inch up, especially with the economy poised to grow moderately in 2019,” he noted.Dass said to reduce the household debt level, there is a need to ensure nominal GDP grows faster than household debt growth.Bank Negara is projecting Malaysia’s GDP to expand between 4.3% and 4.8% this year. In 2018, Malaysia’s GDP grew by 4.7%. Global institutions and international bodies have also cut the country’s GDP growth forecast for 2019. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting a 4.7% growth, while  Moody’s Investors Service, a 4.4% growth.Economists concurred that elevated household debt could add undue pressure to future economic growth and jeopardise financial stability.The risk is that a sharp rise in household debt would leave them exposed to the vulnerabilities of future shocks, especially on their ability to handle shocks that are not anticipated. Estimation suggests that a 5% increase in the household debt to GDP over a three-year period should lower GDP by 1.1% to 1.2% over the next three years, Dass said.Sunway University Business School economics professor Yeah Kim Leng said an elevated debt level means that households are more vulnerable to shocks such as an economic slowdown, commodity and asset price declines, a surge in the cost of living,   interest rate hikes and job losses. “Additionally, being fully leveraged, households have less discretionary income to spend as a sizeable portion of their income goes to servicing debt commitments.“Malaysia has the highest household debt to GDP among the Asean countries. In Asia, only South Korea has a higher ratio while a small number of advanced economies like Australia, Canada and the UK have higher ratios than Malaysia,” he said.Meanwhile, Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd (MARC) chief economist Nor Zahidi Alias said household debt would likely expand at a slower pace in 2019, although its ratio to GDP would remain relatively elevated when compared with regional countries. “Since residential property loans account for more than half of total household debt, the pace of property loan growth will provide some indication on the future trend of Malaysia’s household debt,” he said. In 2018, the growth of loans applied and approved for purchases of residential property moderated significantly to 0.3% and 1.8% when compared with 2017.  In Feb 2019, both loan growth for applied and approved had fallen to a three-month low. “From the above statistics, we believe that this is an indication of further moderation in demand for residential properties that should subsequently cause household debt as a percentage of GDP to moderate further,” he noted.Zahidi, however, cautioned  that household debt could become an issue in the event of a serious economic shock that affects the labour market.  During a serious economic downturn, firms face lower revenue and tend to downsize their workforce, he said. “Rising unemployment would mean lower overall capacity of borrowers to repay debt. That would also affect Malaysia’s headline GDP growth, given that private consumption spending has contributed an average of 71% of total national output over the last eight years,” Zahidi said.Yeah said besides the responsible lending practices introduced by banks to reduce lending to vulnerable borrowers, a key initiative by the government to contain further debt build-up is to increase the supply of affordable housing, as the bulk of the household debt is in mortgages. Other cost-related measures include maintaining low and stable prices for cars, motorcycles and durable goods since these are the other major sources of household credit growth, he said. Discouraging loans taken by individuals to invest in financial assets is another area the authorities can look into. Finally, and more challenging, are the income enhancement measures. The increase in the minimum wage and the continuation of income support for the B40 group to improve the rising cost of living, he said, are the notable programmes continued by the government. “Other income enhancement measures that the government can consider are fiscal and financial incentives for firms to upgrade the skills and productivity of the lower level staff so that their salaries can be raised in tandem with productivity increases,” Yeah noted.Dass said the government needs to further initiate measures to alleviate the cost of living pressures, while ensuring stable income and employment prospects. Besides, he said the need to ensure responsible lending practices continues to support overall household debt servicing capacity.Zahidi said it is also important to look at not only the debt level but also the speed of debt accumulation and debt distribution across the age group and income group.It is crucial to identify the debt-to-income ratio and debt service ratio across all age groups and income groups. According to Bank Negara’s Financial Stability and Payments Report for 2018, the most vulnerable segment are those earning below RM3,000 a month. This is because they have low financial buffers, whereby their debt obligations exceed financial assets by an average of 1.6 times. They comprised 19.3% of total household debt in 2018, down from 24.3% in 2014."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/22/make-use-of-technology-in-accounting-for-smes/,Make use of technology in accounting for SMEs,SMEBiz,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"THE use of technology in accounting for small and medium sized enterprises proffers huge opportunities for both the service providers and users. A good example of this is cloud computing, points out Steven Chong Hou Nian, the newly appointed managing partner of UHY Malaysia. “With cloud computing, the accountant can view entries or invoice clients and many other things all on the go. Best part, both the accountant and the client can look at the same information at the same time. All this reduces time and enhances efficiency,” Chong says.Technology applications that help you store documents and data digitally are also widely available and are very cheap, Chong points out.One reason why the usage of technology will become increasingly important in the context of accounting for SMEs in Malaysia is this: Malaysia has a relatively low number of accountants per capita.“So SMEs in Malaysia are underserved. But technology can help bridge that gap,” Chong adds.In a recent article in ACCA’s AB magazine, Chong is quoted as saying that accounting practitioners need to consider the value add that such new technologies would bring. “Look at the new capabilities that the firm would acquire. Look at the excitement that it would create among its talents. Look at the opportunity costs of clients that the firm would not be able to service if it did not have the required new capabilities and services,” he was quoted as saying. The article had highlighted that adoption of higher-level technologies by accountancy firms in Malaysia is still low, according to the Malaysian Institute of Accountant’s (MIA) recent digital technology blueprint.The report showed that while 92% of respondents occasionally or frequently used accounting software, the adoption rate of other technologies such as data analytics, fintech and artificial intelligence was below 25%. The national accountancy body also noted that while it has observed rising interest in technology among its members, there were also accountants who were uncomfortable with its adoption. AB Magazine said that this highlights one of the biggest changes confronting the profession: the impact of evolving smart technology and how accountants can use it to enhance traditional ways of working.Besides being an elected council member of MIA, Chong is the founding chairman of MIA’s Digital Economy Task Force. That role has led him to work with key accounting and technology figures from the industry to develop various initiatives that drive awareness and innovative technology among accountants in Malaysia. In its press release relating to the appointment of Chong as managing partner for UHY, Chong is described as “a vocal champion of technology adoption among accountants in Malaysia.”"

This means that the firm has nearly doubled its fees.The move came shortly after Didi Chuxing-backed Bluegogo and Meituan-Dianping’s bike-rental arm Mobike announced last month identical price hikes.“As the leading bike-sharing platform Ofo was reportedly struggling financially since the second half of 2018, competition among top-notch platforms is less fierce now,” said Sun Naiyue, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys.“The previous seemingly utopian model has already been subject to scepticism over its ability to turn a profit, making investors wary of shared bikes. Thus bike-sharing companies need to seek new options to become profitable.”Sun noted after recent years of rapid growth, China’s bike-sharing sector has embraced a new era of stable growth, requiring players to shift the focus from rapid market expansion to refined management and operation.“Companies need to seek refined operations to reduce the cost and then offer better services to retain users. “The bike rental fare hike may help companies ease the pressure to turn profitable. However, bike-sharing platforms may also face problems such as the loss of many users. As the ride costs the same or even higher than the bus, shared bikes may lose certain advantages,” Sun added.During the past few years, a bike-sharing boom had swept across China, with coloured dockless bikes taking over major cities and offering convenient rental services via smartphones. And the rapidly-growing sharing trend has seen rounds of ebbs and flows amid the hot competition.“The bike-sharing sector is now going through a downsizing phase, requiring better operational capabilities as well as more investment in high-quality products,” said Raymond Wang, a partner at the consultancy Roland Berger.Data from app tracker Analysys Qianfan show Mobike has taken the top spot in terms of active users in February this year, gaining 11.57 million monthly active users. Meanwhile, Ofo has fallen from the previous top slot to second with 9.9 million monthly active users, followed by HelloBike with nearly 6 million monthly active users.Sun Naiyue said China’s bike rental fever has reached a saturation point. “The bike-sharing sector’s profit model is unclear. It is more likely to see shared bikes as part of the tech giants’ whole ecosystem.“Bike-sharing actually provides a choice for users’ short trips, catering to their specific demands,” Sun added. “Despite the current crisis, the bike-sharing industry will continue to grow in the future.” — China Daily/ANN"

This also marks SME Corp’s entry into the venture capital space. While a large portion of its previous investments had been channelled to grow innovative startups within the tech space, RHL Ventures says this fund will have a broader focus and is more sector-agnostic.“Ever since we started RHL Ventures, we have been inspired by how small businesses can make transformational impact in their industries and the greater economy.“The government has typically led investments that support local businesses during their early stages, so we are glad that the current administration is ramping up its support to instil more innovation within the local business sector. “What RHL Ventures aims to do with this fund is to invest in new businesses that are looking to bring new ideas and disruption in the current ways of doing business,” says RHL Ventures managing partner Rachel Lau.This fund also highlights how partnerships between the government and the private sector will be able to help Malaysian SMEs grow in a sustainable manner in light of the digital economy. It will also help create more avenues for regional expansion.“In Malaysia, SMEs comprise over 98% of total business establishments and contribute more than 37% to the national GDP. They form a central pillar of Malaysia’s economy,” says Noor Azmi Mat Said, chief executive officer of SME Corp Malaysia. “To ensure a higher contribution of SMEs to the national economy, there is a need for more concerted efforts to be affected by stakeholders within the SME ecosystem, an example which private sector players such as RHL Ventures is helping to lead,” he adds.To date, RHL Ventures has invested in tech companies such as healthcare software-as-a-service (SaaS) company HealthMetrics and healthy snacks e-commerce platform Signature Market."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/lyfts-fastslumping-stock-leads-to-lawsuits/,Lyft’s fast-slumping stock leads to lawsuits,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"SAN FRANCISCO:  Snap Inc’s IPO honeymoon in 2017 gave way to investor lawsuits within 10 weeks. With Blue Apron Holdings it was just seven weeks.For Lyft Inc, whose stock has tumbled sharply since its March 28 launch, it took less than three weeks for disillusioned shareholders to sue the company over claims they were taken for a ride.Such lawsuits are a rite of passage for newly public companies, and have become even more common after the 2008 financial crisis, according to Cornerstone Research.Most are dismissed or settle out of court; trials are exceedingly rare.The standard claim is that the company’s officers and underwriters overhyped its prospects, leading to investor losses when when the truth comes out and the stock tanks.Lyft was accused in two nearly identical complaints filed April 16 of exaggerating in its prospectus when it said its US market share was 39%. In both suits, the plaintiffs also dinged the company for failing to tell investors that it was about to recall more than a 1,000 of the bikes in its ride-share program. Lyft declined to comment on the lawsuits.Since going public, Lyft has declined 19% to US$58.36. That compares with the offering price of US$72. The stock sold off sharply amid larger rival Uber Technologies Inc.’s filing for an initial public offering April 11, as investors will soon have another option to bet on the potential of ride-sharing and gig-economy. Experts say that while the first Lyft lawsuits were on the quick side, some companies have been sued even sooner after their IPOs. When Facebook Inc. went public in 2012 and plunged 19% over two days after raising US$16bil in the IPO, it was hit within less than a week by a class action on behalf of investors who lost more than US$2.5bil.“If the bad news comes out very quickly, that is going to cause investors to come out with a lawsuit right away,” said Jay Kesten, an associate professor at Florida State University’s College of Law who specializes in corporate finance and security regulation.“That’s what’s going on here.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/pound-looks-steady-in-brexit-break/,Pound looks steady in Brexit break,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"LONDON: Investor sentiment on the pound is improving after a delay to Brexit, though the return of lawmakers next week may disturb the calm.Volatility in the currency has fallen to the lowest in years and options markets signal there are fewer bets against sterling after Prime Minister Theresa May gained a six-month reprieve from the European Union to try to agree a way forward. Parliament and UK markets will return Tuesday after a Easter recess, with investors likely to stay cautious until a divorce deal is agreed.The pound has been one of the worst performing Group-of-10 currencies against the dollar and euro in the past month, yet remains the biggest gainer in 2019 after a strong start to the year on expectations of a Brexit deal.May’s talks with the opposition Labour Party are continuing as she tries to get approval for the divorce terms from a divided House of Commons.“It now appears that whatever benefit the pound would reap from a successful EU transition may already be behind us,” said Ned Rumpeltin, the European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. The market “has lost most if not all of its sensitivity to ‘good’ Brexit developments.”Risk-reversals, a measure of sentiment and positioning in the options, have seen a sharp reduction in pound puts in recent weeks to signal a more balanced market mood. The three-month measure has surged to the least bearish pound sentiment since last July, with the move mainly due to short bets being wiped out, TD’s Rumpeltin said.“That capitulation may be complete at this stage,” he said. “From here, sterling needs to stand on its own merits for those looking to go long. “If you look at sterling on a forward-looking, risk-adjusted basis, we’re not convinced it makes a compellingly bullish case.”The pound failed to benefit from UK retail-sales data that beat estimates on Thursday. It could weaken to 87.25 pence per euro in coming months, according to Jeremy Stretch, the head of G-10 currency research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.“Despite the bounce in retail sales the underlying macro picture remains fragile at best,” Stretch said. “The delay in the Brexit process seems unlikely to be resolved in the first half of this year, underlining the view that Bank of England inertia may last longer than previously assumed, in the process restraining sterling expectations.”— Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/22/online-lenders-reduce-risk-on-recession-worries/,Online lenders reduce risk on recession worries,SMEBiz,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"US ONLINE lenders such as LendingClub Corp, Kabbage Inc and Avant LLC are scrutinising loan quality, securing long-term financing and cutting costs, as executives prepare for what they fear could be the sector’s first economic downturn.A recession could bring escalating credit losses, liquidity crunch and higher funding costs, testing business models in a relatively nascent industry.Peer-to-peer and other digital lenders sprouted up largely after the Great Recession of 2008. Unlike banks, which tend to have lower-cost and more stable deposits, online lenders rely on market funding that can be harder to come by in times of stress.Their underwriting methods also often include analysis of non-traditional data, such as education level of borrowers. While platforms see that as a strength, it has yet to be tested in times of crisis.“This is very top of mind for us,” LendingClub chief executive officer Scott Sanborn said in an interview, referring to the possibility of a recession. “It’s not a question of ‘if,’ it’s ‘when,’ and it’s not five years away.”Sanborn and executives at some half a dozen other online lenders who spoke to Reuters said worsening economic indicators and forecasts have made them more cautious.Their worries are the latest sign that fears a US downturn is nigh are growing. Economists polled by Reuters in March saw a 25% chance of US recession over the next 12 months. More recently, some executives said, a Federal Reserve decision to halt interest rate hikes reinforced those fears.“We were seeing economists bringing up some warning signs, and we were following the Fed signals and that they were becoming more dovish,” said Bhanu Arora, the head of consumer lending at the Chicago-based lender Avant. “We wanted to be prepared and ready.”To position itself better for recession, Avant came up with a plan late last year that includes tightening credit requirements for segments it identified as higher risk, Arora said.To be sure, the executives said they are not yet seeing glaring signs of trouble in their loan books.A downturn is also far from certain. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co, the country’s largest bank by assets, eased fears of a recession after it posted better-than-expected quarterly profits driven by what it described as solid US economic growth.If a downturn hits, however, it would separate the stronger online lenders from the weaker ones.“All these different platforms say they can underwrite in unique ways,” said Robert Wildhack, an analyst at Autonomous Research. “This will be the first chance we have to see who is right and who might have been taking shortcuts.”In February, LendingClub, one of the pioneers of peer-to-peer lending, offered growth projections for 2019 that fell short of Wall Street expectations, partly a sign of growing caution. LendingClub does not provide loans directly to consumers but earns fees by connecting borrowers and investors on its online marketplace.Sanborn said the company has gotten more stringent about credit standards for borrowers on its platform and is attracting investors with broader risk appetites in case the more cautious participants pull back.It is also outsourcing more of its back-office operations and relocating some staff to Utah from San Francisco to reduce expenses, he said.SoFI, an online lender that refinances student loans and then securitises them, has been focusing on making its portfolio more profitable, even if that may mean lower origination volumes, chief executive officer Anthony Noto told reporters in late-February.Some companies are building more room on their balance sheets and trying to secure funding farther into the future.Small business lender BlueVine Capital Inc, for example, is seeking credit facilities with extended durations. Given a choice to pay 10 basis points less or get a line of credit that lasts an additional year, BlueVine would choose the latter, said Eyal Lifshitz, the company’s chief executive.“We are making sure we are locking in capital for longer periods of time, and from providers that we trust and we know are going to be around,” Lifshitz said.BlueVine offers invoice factoring, where companies exchange future cash flows for current financing, as well as lines of credit that last up to a year. It is postponing the launch of longer-term products because of economic concerns, Lifshitz said.Atlanta-based Kabbage, which lends to small businesses, recently completed a US$700mil asset-backed securitisation. The company said it raised the funding to meet growing borrower demand, but also partly as preparation in case of worsening economic conditions.“We have been waiting for the next recession to happen for the past five years,” said Kathryn Petralia, co-founder and president. “More people feel confident that it’s imminent.” — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/a-promising-bet-on-athleisure/,A promising bet on athleisure,SME,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"WHEN ViQ Apparel first came onto the scene, there weren’t many other local players offering athleisure products. The company can be considered one of the pioneers in the industry.But having no role model as a reference point, founders Kevin Kong and Vivian Ng have had to tweak their business model numerous times over the years before it settled comfortably with its current offline-cum-online hybrid form.Unlike most other suppliers who mainly sell online, ViQ Apparel grows through multiple channels including online, retail outlets, road shows and studio boutiques.“For maximum reach, you need both online and offline,” says Kong.“For sportswear, people like to try and make sure that it is comfortable and fitting. Sometimes, our customers go to our physical store to try for fit before placing an order online.”Previously, ViQ had tried to sell its products through an online marketplace. While the popularity of marketplaces has grown in recent years, that route did not quite work out for the company.“In the beginning, the sales were ok but things changed when the site got flooded with China sellers. In fact, some customers thought we were from China. After two to three years, we felt it was more worthwhile to concentrate on our own online store,” he shares.Kong opines that one of ViQ’s biggest competitive advantages is its strong design aesthetic. Its products are designed in-house and every piece is infused with strong design elements whether it is in the unique prints, cutouts or colour combinations, which helps the brand stand out from the more classic options in the market.All this without sacrificing performance, he emphasises.“From the start, we did not want to be merely resellers of overseas products. We try to do something that other people do not do, something that is 100% made in Malaysia,” he says.While there are only a handful of athleisure players in Malaysia, worldwide, the industry is big business.According to The NPD Group, athleisure was almost a US$46bil market in the US in 2016. Globally, by 2020, athleisure is expected to hit US$350bil in value, driven by wellness, health trends and the casualisation of the working dress code.Reports note the biggest growth is yet to come in athleisure.Just last month, Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica Inc reported a 37% jump in direct-to-consumer net revenue for the three months ended Feb 3, reaping the benefits from heavy investments in boosting its online presence, opening more stores and refreshing its clothing line. It also forecast a strong 2019.Big players like adidas, Under Armour and Nike are also growing their range and a plethora of smaller companies have also benefited from the rise of athleisure.And with the growing trend in health and wellness, there is an upside to the demand for products that cater to this growing crowd.That can only spell good news for ViQ.“Consumers are looking for clothes that do more for them, that aren’t just single-purpose products and which they can wear across multiple activities as we lead busier lives in the 21st century.“Moreover, the wellness lifestyle shows no signs of abating and this will support continued growth in athleisure,” notes Kong.Going by current trends, their biggest customer demographic at the moment is 30-40 years old. Larger sizes are also in demand.“One lady is such a fan, she would buy up all the XL skorts in different colours” shares Ng.Gender-wise, their range comprises 95% women’s products compared to 5% for men, but that ratio has gradually shifted to 80:20 as men, too, become more fashion conscious.Looking ahead, ViQ plans to expand to overseas markets, which would require a different strategy and product line.“Our currency in Malaysia is lower than other countries. In the next few years, we want to take advantage of that and target overseas customers through online sales, but it will take some time.“At the moment, our promotion activities target locals. And our products are Asian-sized. These are the challenges we need to overcome before penetrating the overseas market,” says Kong.But for sure, there is potential to tap newer markets like China where market observers note that consumers’ definitions of the circumstances in which they can wear fitness, athletics and sports clothing are shifting quickly, creating opportunities for producers.Related story:Made for work and leisure"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/opportunities-in-semiconductor/,Opportunities in semiconductor,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"MALAYSIA is among one of the larger semiconductor markets in the world. But there is room for the local industry to further develop its capabilities in the area of design works to remain competitive amid slowing global sales.Raj Kumar, founder and group chief executive officer of IGSS Ventures, notes that Malaysia has the potential to play a bigger role in the semiconductor industry than it does today.“This is especially so in specific capabilities and sectors with multiple advantages that can be better optimised and commercialised.“The unique opportunity here is for Malaysia to start `fabless product companies’, but to do so, we must address the critical needs for top notch product design talents,” he says.IGSS is a Singapore-based company focused on developing and commercialising semiconductor technologies.According to reports, Malaysia is one of the most important semiconductor export markets in Asia – after China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Nonetheless, the country pales in comparison with other semiconductor nations in terms of investments.“Thus far, Malaysia has yet to have a strong home-grown semiconductor champion in the international arena like what TSMC is to Taiwan or Samsung is to South Korea. And China’s investment capabilities, on the other hand, are well ahead of others,” Raj adds.There are generally two main types of semiconductor companies in Malaysia: integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and dedicated foundries. IDMs mainly design, manufacture and sell their own semiconductors, like Intel or Samsung. Dedicated foundries or fabs, on the other hand, are much like “factories for hire” which manufacture semiconductors according to their customers’ specifications.The third category of companies is the fabless companies, which design semiconductors and contract out the manufacturing to other foundries or IDMs with spare manufacturing capacity.Apart from developing a pool of product design talents, issues such as intellectual property protection, licensing and research and development (R&D) spending are also important issues, particularly for fabless companies.“The global semiconductor industry, in general, currently needs viable alternative locations to build their new fabs or relocate their existing niche fabs due to increasing higher operational costs in countries such as Japan, the US and Europe.“If Malaysia develops an intensive national sectorial marketing strategy and further enhance or implement supporting incentives for semiconductor operators, it can very likely attract five to 10 other wafer fabs in the next 10-15 years. “The potential is there for Malaysia to be akin to South Korea in branding itself as an ideal ‘fab relocation’ destination in chosen semiconductor fields in the next 15 years,” says Raj. He adds that growth and expansion of the industry lie in the areas of wafer foundries, outsourced semiconductor assembly and test industries, design services and in supporting entities with niche semiconductor technology capabilities. This will help to differentiate local players from the much bigger global competitors. “These sectors are already present in the country and it provides a strong base for industry players to further tap into,” he says. Other advantages that the local wafer fab industry have include a rich multinational culture, business-friendly laws and good comprehension of English.Another trend that will determine Malaysia’s competitiveness is its ability to adapt and adopt new technology.“The global technological trends led by top semiconductor and technology nations will affect and shape the local industries. Malaysia is playing catch-up.“That is why we will need to prioritise first, the talent development for Industry 4.0, and build skill sets and foundations for companies and sectors that purely or mainly compete with overseas competitors for global businesses.“The semiconductor industry is primarily export-based, hence we are competing with global competitors, and the need to adopt best practices quickly and effectively, is crucial. This also includes establishing business strategies and partnerships that can accelerate technology adoption and achieve business efficiencies to drive innovations,” says Raj. The government has been pushing the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing sector for some time now. However, there is still a lot of education needed for producers to jump on the bandwagon – most don’t know where to begin. While some form of upgrade has already taken place in some parts of the semiconductor industry, these efforts can be further enhanced. An example is the increased automation in repetitive operations in the cleanroom, where robotics can be used in place of manual labour.Raj also points out that the advent of big data and data analytics will be a game-changer for players as demand increases for better efficiencies at the fabs.“The policies and framework surrounding Industry 4.0 sees Malaysia focusing on the right fundamentals. In encouraging investments, innovations, talent development and growth, high-value manufacturers will almost certainly become a key economic driver.“However, as is with any policies or framework, the secret to success lies in the execution of them,” he cautions.Certainly, SMEs in the industry will need greater support. Raj opines that this could come in the form of matching grants or loans to encourage SME innovation and investments in R&D.“Equally important, the universities and higher learning institutes need to strengthen relevant skills to meet rapidly evolving workplace requirements. There should be new syllabus in polytechnics and vocational schools with focus given to non-graduate students on key industries in Malaysia that will drive socio-economic results,” he adds.If all these are realised, Malaysia will be in a good position to play a bigger role in the global market. “Critical success factors include scale, overall capabilities and cost competitiveness, all of which can be improved through economies of scale.”Currently, Singapore and Malaysia are the only two nations in South-East Asia with the capabilities to support wafer fabs, says Raj. He adds that there is plenty of room for both countries to collaborate within the region to create a stronger bloc to challenge larger markets. While Singapore continues to invest in R&D and equipment ecosystem, it faces the challenge of land scarcity and low skilled manpower. Malaysia, on the other hand, has more than enough manpower and a cost advantage. “The case for regionalisation is to optimise the individual capabilities within South-East Asia, and combine them as a collective industry powerhouse, better equipped to compete with bigger players.“By scaling up regional cooperation, South-East Asia can create a robust semiconductor space in comparison with China, Taiwan and South Korea. “By making us a force to be reckoned with, we are more likely to attract multi-billion semiconductor investments from Japan, the US and Europe where some of the niche fabs and supporting industries need to relocate or have a ‘dual-location’ strategy,” he says.Last year, IGSS tied-up with local semiconductor wafer foundry SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd in a technology transfer deal. The partnership will significantly reduce production costs.“SilTerra’s capabilities complement ours as they have a world-class semiconductor facility and an aligned strategy of focusing on differentiated emerging niche semiconductor technologies so it can still grow healthily in this space. “The partnership we have with SilTerra is both strategic and a trusted one, with a win-win model. With continued focus and intensity, it will positively change the future of both companies within the next three to five years,” Raj says."

It was not mentioned once in the summit communique from two years ago.“We underline the importance of promoting green development,” the draft reads. “We encourage the development of green finance including the issuance of green bonds as well as development of green technology.” The Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Friday that the Belt and Road project is not a ”geopolitical tool” or a debt crisis for participating nations, but Beijing welcomes constructive suggestions on how to address concerns over the initiative.A total of 37 foreign leaders are due to attend the April 25-27 summit, though the United States is only sending lower-level representatives, reflecting its unease over the scheme.The number of foreign leaders at the April 25-27 summit is up from 29 last time, mainly from China’s closest allies like Pakistan and Russia but also Italy, Switzerland and Austria.China has repeatedly said Belt and Road is for the benefit of the whole world, and that it is committed to upholding globally accepted norms in ensuring projects are transparent and win-win for all parties.“We emphasise the importance of the rule of law and equal opportunities for all,” the draft reads. — Reuters"

The new kick comes with a sole largely free of unrecycled plastic, and leather made at a factory the company says has less environmental impact than your typical shoe manufacturer.Everlane pledges that its shoes, which took two years to design, will be completely carbon neutral.“There’s a set of customers that want a great sneaker, but don’t necessarily fit in,” says Michael Preysman, the company’s co-founder and chief executive. “The problem with sneaker culture is there’s a lot of waste, and it’s disposable.”Preysman says the label’s expansion into sneakers “completes the American uniform”, adding to the two quintessential items it already sells: T-shirts and jeans. The first Tread shoe will be a US$98 (RM406) leather trainer that comes in seven understated colours like off-white, grey and navy. They will be available in Everlane’s stores and online on April 25.The popular startup is entering a crowded field, one full of newcomers vying for a slice of the US$20bil US industry. Alternatives to traditional labels like Nike and Adidas have proliferated in recent years. The most prominent, Allbirds, with its comfy wool sneakers, is a Silicon Valley darling, as seen by its US$77mil in venture capital. Rothy’s, which started with women’s flats, now sells a line of recycled slip-on sneakers. Greats sells simple sneakers, focused on long-lasting shoes and reducing their carbon footprint.As Everlane executives see it, sneakers are the most egregious example of disposable fashion – where trends turn over so quickly that shoppers quickly trade up.New sneaker styles are released regularly in what the industry calls “drops”. Kicks are publicised ahead of time, building desire in the run-up to the release date. Shoppers line up outside streetwear boutiques and company stores when a popular, limited-edition shoe hits.Meanwhile, discarded shoes accumulate in landfills, a fact made worse by the energy-intensive process needed to make them. To be fair, the secondary market for sneakers is especially robust, spawning specialised resale sites such as StockX, Grailed and GOAT. But it’s still small compared with what ends up in the garbage.This cycle, Preysman says, is “a disaster for the planet”. Sneakers should be worn for years, not months, he says. Tread will eventually release new styles and colours, but not like the rapid-fire method used by the industry.The corporate giants of the sneaker industry have made some progress on the earth consciousness front. Adidas has pledged to eliminate new plastic from its supply chain by 2024, and Nike says 75% of its shoes and apparel contain some kind of recycled material.Tread shoes use leather from Vietnamese supplier Saigon TanTec, which has integrated natural lighting and solar energy into its production operations, using less electricity and fresh water than comparable factories. Laces and linings are made from recycled plastic instead of polyester. The soles, normally made entirely from plastic, are constructed from a blend of natural rubber and post-industrial recycled rubber, resulting in a 94.2% virgin-plastic free component.Preysman said it’s still not good enough. Tread will work toward eliminating all new plastic from its production process by 2021, he says.“The unfortunate piece is we’re doing the best the industry allows right now,” said Preysman. “We’re waiting for the industry to get there. It is really, really challenging to find the right materials at the right cost.” — Bloomberg"

As the 25-year-old turned the wheel in Silicon Valley, an empty truck 2,500 miles away in Atlanta picked up semi trailers and towed them around a warehouse lot.From seven states away, Shukman backed trailers into loading docks and parking spaces. “We were able to do some manoeuvrers that were so difficult that there were truck drivers there that said that they could not do that,” he said.Phantom Auto was founded in 2017 to help bridge the gap between the vision and the reality of autonomous vehicles. It offers remote-driving technology that provides human intervention for construction zones, bad weather, roadside emergencies or anything else that might fluster the artificial intelligence piloting a driverless car. With Phantom Auto’s software and a cellular connection, a trained human operator can take over a car and guide it through difficult spots. Now the startup is announcing an expansion into logistics, providing remote operation capability for forklifts, delivery robots, and “yard truck” tractors that move trailers around warehouses and shipping centres. Phantom Auto last Thursday said it has raised US$13.5mil in a round of financing lead by Bessemer Venture Partners. The company has raised roughly US$19mil to date. Phantom Auto’s new line of business shows just how deep the current moment of disillusionment has become for the self-driving car industry. After years of development and more than US$10bil in investment, autonomous vehicles still aren’t ready for widespread public use. Phantom Auto’s original strategy was to fill gaps in robotaxi capabilities. But autonomous ride-hailing fleets have made little progress beyond testing and rarely operate without human safety drivers – sometimes working in pairs – sitting in the front seat.Alphabet Inc’s Waymo is offering limited ride-hailing service to a small number of customers in suburban Phoenix, usually with a safety driver on board to take over if the robot fails as well as remote monitors who can intervene. Virtually no other autonomous startup is ferrying passengers through traffic, and that means little demand for Phantom Auto’s remote-driving technology. Phantom Auto says it has agreements to sell its technology to large automakers, so that faraway backup drivers can troubleshoot autonomous fleets once they hit the road. “We’ve talked to literally every major player in the space, and given the nature of what we do, we have to have pretty detailed discussions about their limitations, their capabilities, and their actual rollout dates,” said co-founder Elliot Katz. “Everyone who says they’re deploying, whatever they say they’re deploying in the near term, it’s completely false.” The startup decided to enter logistics as a way to survive in the meantime. Even the stopgap provider in the self-driving industry needed a stopgap strategy. Yard trucks, forklifts and delivery vehicles offer a faster path to market because each operates at relatively low speeds, carry no passengers, and can be used without engaging with traffic on public roads. Katz said his company is also looking at possibilities in construction and mining. There is a strong appetite for automated and remote technology in these industries because professional operators can be hard to find and often don’t live close to the job sites where they are needed.Phantom’s yard truck customers, according to Katz, include retailers with dozens of distribution centres across the country. Using remote operation, the startup can potentially service all of them from a central location, with drivers bouncing instantly from Alabama to Ohio to Oregon as needed. If Phantom Auto or its rivals can make this vision real, it will dramatically expand and reshape the labour pool for industrial-vehicle operators. An early-stage venture fund within Google led a US$6mil investment last year in Scotty Labs, a remote-driving equipment startup. Volvo Construction Equipment recently announced tests of remote-controlled wheel loaders over a 5G cellular network in Sweden.Deficit of talent“There’s a deficit of talent available in our industry,” said Scott Young, Volvo CE’s vice-president for customer support in the Americas. “This is how we bring the work to the talent pool.” The legions of young people who play online video games, Young points out, are already learning to work on teams remotely, suggesting that the heavy equipment operator of the future could be more gamer than teamster.  Shukman, for one, doesn’t fit the profile of the typical yard truck driver. A self-taught roboticist and programmer, he was an avid gamer during his college years at the University of California at Santa Barbara. He once wrote a strategy guide for the game League of Legends that has been viewed over four million times online.Since joining Phantom two years ago, Shukman has helped test and develop its remote driving consoles. Most of the other remote drivers at Phantom started out as safety drivers at autonomous car developers. Phantom puts all of them through a training protocol that takes about two weeks and requires passing a series of tasks, such as remotely navigating a slalom course.Shukman hadn’t been inside of an actual yard truck until three months ago when Terberg Group BV, the Dutch manufacturer working with Phantom to put remote-driving systems into its trucks, delivered one to California for retrofitting. He spent a day doing drills and manoeuvrers in the real truck before moving back inside to practice on the remote console. It took him about two weeks before he felt comfortable.“The big thing about that shift between driving locally and driving remotely, although it’s different, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more difficult,” said Shukman. A highlight reel released by Phantom shows Shukman backing into impossibly narrow spaces, and he describes the visibility on the monitors as superior to looking through a truck’s wind shield. Most of Phantom Auto’s warehouse clients plan to teach current truck operators to do the job remotely. A few drivers have already been through the training. “They were a little nervous at first,” said Shukman, “and then within the two-week period they were nailing manoeuvrers that very few people can do.”It’s too soon to tell, said Katz, whether gamers or truckers make for better remote operators. “The biggest thing that we stress,” said Katz, “is even though you’re sitting in a remote location and you’re behind the screen, this is real life.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/tax-cuts-in-china-poised-to-boost-private-businesses/,Tax cuts in China poised to boost private businesses,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"SHU Wenbin is one of the millions of private business entrepreneurs in China set to benefit from large-scale tax cuts that take effect this month.The 33-year-old general manager of Continental Interior Design and Construction in Beijing said he thinks the 2 trillion yuan (RM1.24 trillion) in cuts to taxes and fees, outlined in the Government Work Report on March 5, many of them targeted at small and micro businesses, will give his company a major boost.“We will fully feel the strength of the tax reduction. This is a policy that benefits enterprises and the people as well. We will invest the money we save in the development of the company and its operations,” he said.The tax cuts are a result of the government’s renewed commitment to the private sector, officials said.Yet the scale of the cuts announced in the Government Work Report surprised many business observers.The reductions represent more than 2% of China’s gross domestic product (GDP) and more than the individual economies of countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Egypt, Finland or Chile, according to their 2018 nominal GDP rankings by the International Monetary Fund.The biggest change comes in value added tax where the rate for manufacturing businesses is being reduced from 16% to 13%.For most other sectors, including transportation and construction, the rate is being cut from 10% to 9%.There are also major reductions in corporate income tax charged against profits. The rate for businesses with a turnover of less than 1 million yuan is being halved from 10% to 5%, while that for companies with a turnover of less than 3 million yuan is 10% minus 50,000 yuan.Continental Interior Design and Construction, which was founded in 2008, employs 100 people and works mainly for corporate clients, will benefit from the fall in the VAT rate from 10% to 9%, and it will also be boosted by many of its suppliers enjoying a 3% cut.Shu said he will invest the tax savings in three main areas: staff training, particularly in project management, the development of new products, and seeking new markets on the outskirts of Beijing and in South and Southwest China.“The policies clearly demonstrate the government’s commitment to the private sector and its willingness to help businesses like ours. We believe it is a very innovative approach,” Shu added.Russell Brown, managing partner of Lehman Brown, an accountancy firm in Beijing, and a former chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, said tax rates on the Chinese mainland were now competitive with those in Hong Kong.The corporate income tax rate in the special administrative region is 8.2% for companies with a turnover of less than HK$2mil (RM1.06mil).“These are now very competitive rates that should benefit the economy overall. They should also lead to less tax avoidance, and so there may not be a reduction in the overall tax take in the longer term,” he said.Zhu Tian, professor of economics at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, also believes the cuts will lead to less tax evasion.“If you lower tax rates, companies are more likely to truthfully state their income. The VAT cut is the most significant because it is an important tax source in China and is hard to evade.”Debate about the importance of the private sector to the Chinese economy heightened at the end of last year.President Xi Jinping made clear on a visit to Liaoning province in September that both State-owned enterprises (SOE) and private businesses are vital.He said it was wrong to disparage SOEs and that the private sector, which has been beset with funding difficulties and a lack of available finance, needed the government’s “care and support”.Tax cuts for private businesses have been very much part of the government’s agenda since 2012, when a pilot programme to replace business tax with VAT was introduced in Shanghai.The government also made reductions to VAT in May, cutting that which applied to the manufacturing sector from 17% to 16% and to the transportation and construction sectors from 11% to 10%.According to the State Administration of Taxation, VAT cuts amounted to 270 billion yuan between May and December, with the manufacturing sector enjoying 35% of the benefits.Fresh optimism among private businesses was also reflected in a survey released on April 9.Some 71% of Chinese businesses interviewed in the CPA Australia Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey expect to grow this year, compared with the regional average of 68%.VAT cutsThe proportion was significantly higher than those for Singapore and Australia, where expansion of 60% and 48% is expected by private businesses.Zhu, at the China Europe International Business School, believes the VAT cuts will be a major boost to small businesses.He said the reductions will lower companies’ costs and increase demand for their products because they will be cheaper.“There is both a demand and supply effect. Much of the reduction is going to be all profit for companies,” he said.Zhu said tax cuts are a very effective way of boosting the economy.“Tax cuts are a supply-side stimulus. If the profits rise, you stimulate investment and you give companies more confidence in the future, so they invest,” he added.Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale University’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, said the tax cuts should ease the pressure on small companies that faced funding difficulties at the end of last year after the government tightened credit to reduce debt in the economy.Many small and medium-sized companies have been at the forefront of deleveraging pressures because of the squeeze on shadow banking in particular, he said.Roach, a former Asia head of investment bank Morgan Stanley, did not think the cuts would be of huge benefit to high-technology businesses in the new economy, as they were already generating healthy cash flows.Much of the new economy is growing very rapidly, generating huge increases in cash flow, so it does not rely on external funding and has less of a need for any stimulus, he said.The cuts will not only benefit domestic companies but also those from overseas.Massimo Bagnasco, managing partner of Progetto CMR (Beijing) Architectural Design Consultants, part of a leading Italian architectural company, said the reductions would provide a boost.“It is definitely a positive action which will support small businesses,” he said, adding that the VAT reduction would definitely help some companies.Bagnasco said foreign companies in particular want to see improvements in other aspects of the business environment in China, not just tax cuts.“One of the key issues for small and medium-sized enterprises, especially foreign ones, is better access to financing. Another major issue is ensuring reasonable payment terms. There is currently no consolidated legislation in China on late payment, which would alleviate many cash flow burdens SMEs have in China,” he added.Edward Tse, founder and chief executive officer of management consultancy Gao Feng Advisory, said the cut in VAT in particular would ease the pressures on small businesses.“It is a highly welcome policy change. It has to be seen as a very good signal from the government. The corporate sector has been making the case for many years that taxes should be substantially reduced, and the government has now responded,” he said.“Companies will either use the money they save to pay dividends or reinvest in their business, some of which will be in research and development, which can only be positive for the economy.”Charles-Edouard Bouee, chief executive officer of management consultancy Roland Berger, also believes the tax cuts will ease some of the financial pressures that small businesses in China have been facing.“I think they are significant and this is a good effort by the government,” he said.Bouee, who has written extensively about the Chinese economy, said that regardless of tax cuts, the country’s private sector is now one of the most vibrant in the world.“It is much more entrepreneurial than Europe and is much more similar to that in the US. The world has changed a lot in the past 10 years, and what Chinese businesses have been able to do, whether they are in the tech sector or not, is adapt to new technology,” he said.Zhu Ning, deputy dean at the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, said the tax cuts are addressing the slump in business confidence at the end of last year.“Many companies – particularly export-oriented manufacturing businesses in Zhejiang province – found they were not making enough profit, and some of them closed down. This sector suddenly lost the confidence it had built up over decades,” he said.“The tax cuts represent a new incentive and I expect we are going to see this policy continue with cuts targeting new sectors such as artificial intelligence and high-end manufacturing.”For Shu, at Continental Interior Design and Construction, the cuts show the government is unequivocally on the side of small businesses.“I am encouraged by the care and attention the Party and the government is offering the private sector. It only enhances my passion and confidence in running a business and developing innovation for the good of the nation,” he said.“Our company and myself, as an individual, are confident and willing to contribute to the great journey of this new era.” — China Daily/ANN"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/fintech-shows-the-way-forward/,Fintech shows the way forward,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"THE Perdana Leadership Foundation’s CEO Forum 2019 was held on April 4 with the theme: “Accelerating the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Malaysia.”In his keynote address, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad emphasised the importance of effective implementation of real public-private sector initiatives. I moderated the session on: Innovating Financial Services, with experts including from Bank Negara and the Fintech Association. Basically, the discourse centered on how digitalisation has begun to change the way we live and do business, and to improve our way of life. The broad brushThe discussion focused essentially on Fintech: the innovative industry straddling the world of finance and technology. Its products and services range from mobile cheque deposits to robo advisers; from banking digitalisation to electronic data management; from cryptocurrencies to their underlining blockchain technology. Fintech is often the solution looking for a problem: i.e. financial exclusion! The industry faces many challenges despite growing into a global force that attracted US$71bil in investment between 2015 and 2016. Indeed, Fintech has become the dominant force behind big advances in finance, especially in promoting Financial Inclusion (FI). Leaving aside the relentless advance of the mobile-phone and mobile-Internet, this is made possible through cheap biometric systems as well as cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics. Hence, Ant Financial’s 3-1-0 model: three seconds to reach a credit decision; one second to transfer the money; and zero human intervention. Today, Big Tech’s move into finance is threatening to disrupt global finance. Europe’s 2018 “open banking” regulation has left bankers worried – that tech groups will cherry-pick the best part of their businesses. Banks are at a disadvantage as they face intensifying competition in the face of uneven regulations. Amazon is providing payments services and loans on its platform; Facebook is securing electronic money licences. Alibaba and Tencent are dominant in China’s US$5.5 trillion payment industries. Indeed, as I see it, the cashless society has already arrived in China. Even gone so far where beggars display the WeChat code to electronically receive handouts. Alipay and WeChat have now gone cross-border, cooperating with Paytm India, True Money Thailand and bKash Bangladesh. They reach out to the world’s unbanked and unbankable. FintechChina is today at the forefront of the global fintech innovation. To its credit, China’s activities are market driven. It now engages in global cooperation for mutual learning. Chinese fintech’s mature technologies help many nations develop digital payments systems that fit local cultures, technology and policies. In the process, they can often offer regulators their experience in balancing innovation and risk. In terms of financial regulation: Singapore offers an overall plan for Fintech development; and the Regulatory Sandbox initiative in the United Kingdom, Thailand and Malaysia allows for experiment with innovative financial products and services. China is taking the global lead in digital FI through implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative to promote global sustainable development. It has enabled small and medium-sized banks to reach a wider range of small and micro businesses and farmers through the exploration of technologies, including big data, AI, and blockchain. The essence of FI is to comprehensively enhance the ability of small and weak businesses and individuals to survive, develop and even foster innovation. In my view, the digital world requires government to be at its best by just being there to assist, and not to lead. So far, fintech’s success in raising interconnectivity is based on business sustainability. The government can safeguard the healthy development of fintech firms by helping them regulate their own business models, and in turn, improve the regulatory framework. In addition, fintech start-ups are racing to become the top global app for global money transfers, e.g. WorldRemit and TransferWise, both succeeding in disrupting the transfer industry. Furthermore, their global e-wallets today greatly facilitate payments of individuals and small businesses. Using blockchain technology, the real-time cross-border e-payment service provided by AlipayHK has opened up a new possibility in financial interconnectivity. If e-wallets in different countries can be linked together, it will greatly facilitate the cross-border payments of individuals and small and micro businesses. It also promises to elevate inclusive finance to a higher level and supplements the SWIFT cross-border payment service for banks. In the United States, fintech firms now can apply for special purposes charters to compete directly with banks in lending, in the face of the success of Stripe, Social Finance and LendingClub. Chinese fintech has since expanded to disrupt the last frontier, on-demand insurance.   What’s happening?There is widespread perception among corporates and consumers that Malaysian banks have lagged behind. Why so? According to PWC, 82% of Malaysia-based financial institutions in 2018 see fintech as a threat to their business; and 22% reckon that they could lose more than 20% of their revenues to fintech firms. Hence, the push-back. Yet, regulators (including Bank Negara) are actively advocating for fintech to be an integral part of the national initiative to drive digitalisation to remain competitive. Indeed, so far, mobile payments are leading the way. Consumer readiness? smartphone penetration in 2018: 88%; preference to use cards over cash: up 16%; fall in cheque use: down 18%; debit card penetration: 144%. Bank Negara data shows electronic payments are continuing to record double-digit growth – increased usage of mobile banking: 44%; of Internet banking: 50%. Nevertheless, the central bank views digital innovation as an important enabler to promote greater access and responsible usage of financial services. To this end, the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox (sandbox) continues to ensure that regulation remains responsive to innovation. In 2018, the bank introduced specialised thematic tracks to the sandbox to allow for a more targeted and efficient testing approach for high-impact innovations. Further progress was also made in facilitating Open Application Program Interface (OAPI) adoption to encourage healthy competition and improve quality and efficiency. While the focus to date has mainly been on facilitating access through OAPIs, much work remains to be done on secure methods in allowing third-party access to a broader scope of financial data, as well as on safeguards to protect consumers. To further promote an inclusive financial system, the central bank also partnered the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and Malaysia Digital Economy Corp to launch the Digital Innovation Hub (Innovation Hub) and the inclusive Fintech Accelerator Program (Accelerator Program). The Innovation Hub is largely aimed at meeting the needs of the low-income, with a focus on enabling service providers (including fintech start-ups) to use technology to promote inclusive finance. The Innovation Hub seeks to build a community of innovative developers. Participating service providers are expected to benefit from the cross-fertilisation of ideas and market research generated via the Innovation Hub, particularly to better tailor their products and services to meet the needs of the underbanked. The Accelerator Program aims to address specific FI pain points within Malaysia, with four key focus areas: spending, saving, borrowing and financial planning. The first of a series of the program was jointly organised by the Bank and UNCDF in December 2018. To bridge the disconnect gap, Fintech Association of Malaysia president Mohammad Ridzuan Abdul Aziz is determined to re-double efforts with financial institutions to fully meet consumers’ expectations, and to “explore new business opportunities to create new revenue streams in collaboration with fintech firms”. To top it all, some fintechs are reported to have started to rebrand as regtech (regulatory technology) in a bid to convince banks that their products and services are indispensable, by pointing to legislation that fintech can resolve. Still, most consumers point out that the impact of seamlessness and convenience in retail banking has yet to be fully and widely felt: old ways do die hard. Cash usage remains prevalent, with cash to GDP ratio at 6.6% in 2018 (6.1% in 2014). Yet, Bank Negara assures that access to financial services remains high, with access points available in even sub-districts across the nation, providing accessibility to almost full financial services. Indicators of FI do show an improved take-up of financial products and greater usage of digital channels to conduct financial transactions. These developments further contribute to greater FI which is concerned not only with access, but also the responsible use of financial services to improve social well-being.InsuretechFintech start-ups have begun to focus on insurance, claiming that from binding a policy to making a claim, consumers need not have to speak to anyone. Indeed, to insure personal property, insuretech firms offer a novel type of coverage that can be turned on and off with the swipe of the smartphone. Also, this industry has become known for offbeat products, e.g. overtime work and traffic jam, even mid-autumn moon-insurance, offering compensation if clouds block off the moon (when a glimpse of it offers much good luck). Other insuretech products include policies covering parking tickets and even, love.What then are we to doFinancial inclusion (FI) has become the major beneficiary of fintech. Almost inadvertently, the spread of mobile telephony and mobile-Internet services has brought hundreds of millions of people into the formal system. “Mobile money” (transfer of cash by phone) has become a global phenomenon. “Findex” (financial-inclusion index) measures the scale of FI and track efforts to tackle it. It now appears that the ranks of the financially excluded are thinning fast, and the process will accelerate further. One reason is the growth in mobile-phone and internet penetration, making finance accessible even to those living a long way from physical banks or ATMs. According to findex, 78% of the world’s unbanked adults receiving wages in cash have a mobile phone. Moreover, the unbanked are now regarded as an increasingly attractive commercial market. Firms as diverse as Ant Financial and PayPal make much of their role in expanding FI “to democratise financial services”. However, on the commercial side, tensions have since arisen between the different businesses engaged in this market: (a) banks are jealous of their traditional quasi-monopoly on formal finance, and yet wary of further risky adventures in “subprime” markets; (b) mobile-network operators now provide the infrastructure for payment, the most basic of financially inclusive service; (c) “fintech’s” aggressive financial-technology start-ups now fizz with bright ideas and sometimes even greed; and (d) increasingly, the “platforms” big Internet firms have a lock on how people spend their time online. I believe the winner from all this competition will be the consumers, “especially those relatively excluded”. Furthermore, automation and usage of facial recognition technology also increase easy access and reduce the cost of providing finance, and make it profitable to deal in smaller amounts of money. Instead of being a bad banking risk, the poor has become a business opportunity at the bottom of the pyramid. And new sorts of data, along with more sophisticated ways of using them, can compensate for the lack of a credit history and give the unbanked and unbankable access to finance for the first time. About one-quarter of the world’s population remains financially underprivileged. Fintech and mobile phones will help change all that – and fast.Former banker, Harvard educated economist and British Chartered Scientist, Tan Sri Lin See-Yan is the author of The Global Economy in Turbulent Times (Wiley, 2015) & Turbulence in Trying Times (Pearson, 2017).

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/boeing-nears-finish-of-max-software-fix-as-faa-review-looms/,Boeing nears finish of Max software fix as FAA review looms,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"CHICAGO: Boeing Co is working through the final steps before asking US regulators to review an update for anti-stall software linked to two fatal 737 Max accidents, an early milestone to lifting a global grounding of its best-selling jet.But there are many steps in the Federal Aviation Administration’s assessment of the proposed fix, and that process could stretch well into June even if there are no complications, said a person familiar with the matter. Boeing must also convince authorities from Beijing to Brussels that the plane is safe. Canada has already signaled it won’t follow an FAA panel’s recommendation against requiring additional simulator training for pilots.Boeing has completed its engineering trial of the updated software, and its technical and engineering leaders were on board the final flight test earlier this week, chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a video message on late Wednesday.Up next is what he described as a “certification flight,” as Boeing prepares to submit the final paperwork to US regulators.For that flight, Boeing will hand over the controls of a 737 Max to FAA pilots to test design enhancements that the company says ensure the system won’t ever again overwhelm flight crews - as it did in two crashes that killed a total of 346 people. The regulator will determine when the certification flight takes place.“We’re making steady progress toward certification,” Muilenburg said, standing in front of a Max aircraft at Boeing Field, an airport south of Seattle. Earlier in the day, he had been a passenger on a demonstration flight, watching the final update to the so-called MCAS software “operating as designed across a range of flight conditions.” Muilenburg has stepped up Boeing’s campaign to boost public confidence in the safety of the 737 Max, and the company’s airplane designs, after two of the jets crashed within five months. The Max, which debuted in May 2017, is the newest version of a single-aisle jetliner family that is Boeing’s biggest source of profit.In all, Chicago-based Boeing has conducted 120 flights, spending 203 hours in the air testing the new system, Muilenburg said. The campaign has included a 737 Max 7 outfitted with flight-testing instrumentation, as well as aircraft that have rolled out of a Boeing factory south of Seattle with the updated software already installed.The upgrade is designed to make the anti-stall system less aggressive and prevent the repeated nose-down commands that overwhelmed flight crews for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines. In addition, MCAS - it stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System - would no longer be triggered by a single erroneous sensor reading.Southwest Airlines Co, the biggest US operator of the Max, expressed confidence in the plane. Chief executive officer Gary Kelly said the carrier is eager to resume flying the aircraft once it’s ready. He also said Southwest had no plans at this time to cancel any Max orders.“It’s a very good airplane but Boeing has acknowledged they have some things they need to address,” Kelly said at an event in Dallas on Thursday. “It seems like a relatively straightforward modification. We’re anxious to get the airplane back.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/why-is-everyone-worried-about-turkeys-foreign-reserves/,Why Is everyone worried about Turkey’s foreign reserves?,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"Turkey’s central bank won’t explain what’s behind the recent moves in its foreign currency reserves – and that’s making investors nervous.The lira weakened more than any other currency on Thursday amid speculation that the central bank was using money borrowed from commercial banks in short-term swaps to inflate its foreign reserve figures. It sank nearly 2% on growing concerns before paring some of those losses.Here’s a quick look at what’s going on:How much does Turkey hold in foreign currency reserves?That depends on what you count. Net international reserves as defined by the International Monetary Fund stood at US$28.4bil in the week through April 12. But the central bank says it’s misleading to focus on the net figures and instead urges investors to look at its gross reserves, which amount to a little under US$98bil.The central bank reports the lower, or net, figure because of a stand-by financing deal Turkey signed with the IMF nearly two decades ago, according to Ibrahim Turhan, a former deputy central bank governor. He agrees that it makes more sense to focus on the gross figure, which includes the amount commercial lenders park at the central bank as a requirement against their dollar liabilities. As long as Turkish residents keep their foreign currency savings at banks, then a part of that will continue to be held at the central bank, which can use those funds in any way it sees fit, Turhan said.Why do investors care so much about Turkey’s reserves?Turkey has about US$118bil of foreign-currency debt maturing within the next 12 months. It’ll need the central bank’s buffers to meet those obligations if the flow of capital that finances the economy slows.Foreign investors have already withdrawn a net US$1.6bil from the lira-denominated bond market this year amid political and economic turbulence. A sudden drop in reserves in March prompted the lira’s biggest single-day decline since last year’s currency crash. JPMorgan Chase & Co recommends investors sell the lira, citing the drawdown.Why do investors fear the reserve numbers might be inflated?Turkey’s central bank began last month borrowing excess foreign currency from commercial lenders through FX swap auctions, lending the banks liras in return. Since the swaps were introduced, there’s been a steady build-up in its reserves, prompting speculation that the borrowed money was being used by the central bank to give the impression that its foreign currency stockpiles were growing when much of the money is destined for other uses.How much money are we talking about?In the first three weeks after the FX swaps were introduced through April 12, net reserves rose by just over 20 billion liras, or around US$3.5bil at today’s fixing. The amount the central bank borrowed during the period was just under US$13bil, leaving around US$9bil unaccounted for assuming the borrowed amount is reflected in reserves one for one. If that’s the case, for the net reserves to remain steady, the central bank would need to roll over the swaps every week when they expire.So, where is the money?We don’t know. That’s the short answer. The longer answer is that the amount the central bank may have used to repay maturing foreign debt or what it may have sold to Turkey’s state energy company, which pays for gas imports, doesn’t add up to such large amounts.That has led to speculation that the central bank is using its FX arsenal to support the lira. The central bank is obliged to announce currency market interventions, however, and it hasn’t done so. According to central bank data, the last such intervention was done on Jan 23, 2014. That’s left investors wondering whether the central bank is intervening indirectly. Traders say state lenders have been on the selling side of the dollar trade in recent weeks.What do the investors say?Most economists say the Turkish central bank owes investors a thorough explanation of what appears to be a discrepancy in the foreign-currency reserve data. Its credibility is already in question after repeated pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who’s embarked on increasingly interventionist economic policies and lashed out at banks for giving negative guidance.For Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, the reserves saga is not just a matter of transparency over a single data point. “The real takeaway is that the institutional framework appears to be breaking down further in Turkey,” he said. — Bloomberg"

The order, that was taken in January, was valid for 90 days, meaning that the protection period has come to an end now. The end of the order coincided with the stepping down of Nik Hamdan earlier this week.
Barakah is one of the new oil and gas (O&G) companies that came into the market in the last O&G run. However, it read the market wrongly and expanded its business just before the crash in June 2014. From then onwards, it has been downhill for the company.
As for Nik Hamdan, he was one of the new corporate guys who made it to the top for a while because of the O&G run. The entry of the Samling group added some credence to the group’s ability to be able to restructure its debts.
However, that has not been the case. The debts are still not restructured and Nik Hamdan has stepped down. Going forward, it should not come as a surprise to anyone if his shares are continued to be forced-sold in the market.
The space to watch out for is the new name to emerge, who would dare take on a company with huge ebts.
The indebted civil service
A REPORT by CGS-CIMB this week highlighted an interesting statistic – that in 2017 alone, a massive RM5bil was lent out to civil servants by credit cooperatives, which are part of  Angkasa, Malaysia’s national co-operative movement. That is a staggering figure but it is not new. Last year, a report by Bank Negara revealed that Malaysia’s civil servants spent more than half of their monthly salaries repaying debts. As at Feb 2018, the total outstanding civil servants debt stood at RM236bil, equivalent to 20% of total household debt or 17% of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is higher than levels observed in 2012 at 18% of total household debt or 15% of the GDP. Credit obtained from non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) amounted to 62%, significantly higher than the national average of 18%.
The indebtedness of Malaysia’s civil service is clearly a massive problem that needs to be fixed. The central bank has said that its policy priorities include measures to improve financial literacy and strengthen NBFI lending practices and oversights, which are vital to achieve a more sustainable level of civil servant debt accumulation and avert the build-up of risks in the future. The main reason why debt providers are apt to seek out lending opportunities to civil servants is the presence of the Angkasa auto deduction scheme.  The Angkasa scheme allows for deductions from civil servants’ income to repay their debts, making their creditors virtually risk-free. No wonder many companies seek out opportunities in this area. 
The CGS-CIMB report was on Ace Market-listed Orion IXL Bhd , which has been losing money over the last few years. But Orion has inked a deal with Angkasa to provide a fintech end-to-end loan application and approval platform called MyAngkasa Az-Zahra for its credit co-operatives to offer microloans to government staff. While such a service may be a cheaper and more efficient way for civil servants to borrow, the bigger question is, what is being done to solve the problem of getting them out of their already highly indebted situation?
Where is the catalyst?
NEWS of the revival of the ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects is certainly music to the ears of the construction sector. The sector, even though its contribution to the GDP is not the largest among the other majors sectors of the economy, has the most linkages with the economy.
Money that flows to the sector translates the fastest to lifting economic growth. With the economy projected to grow between 4.3% and 4.8% this year, that is a signal that something needs to be done fast.
The growth is not fantastic but some will argue it is decent, given the overhaul of governance and the focus on tackling debt. But as the Pakatan Harapan government closes in on one year of its administration, the question that begs asking is what is there to be positive about economically?
The stock market is in a funk. It is a great generator of wealth, but only little of that has happened over the past four years. Housing is in a slump and despite the predilection of developers that sunrise is on the horizon, it is looking more like a prolonged Arctic winter, where the sun will only rise after a long, long time. Palm oil too has its own problems, where prices of the good old days may just be an urban legend how things are going.
Consumer spending growth continues to fall and then there is investments, which are not great, and job creation, where people are worried about retrenchments rather than finding a higher-paying job.
What Malaysia needs is a new catalyst, something to excite businesses and money flow. Maybe the drive into agriculture will be one, but that is not the quick fix the capital market needs, especially when it is faced with a massive exodus of money from the potential removal of the country from one of the major bond indices.
The ECRL will help with construction flows but Bandar Malaysia talks about building more buildings that will only add to the building glut that engulfs the sector. Hopefully, there will be further policy developments in the months ahead that can lift the sentiment and prospects of the business sector."

It is estimated that there are currently about three million EVs on the world’s roads, with sales growing at close to 75% a year. 
According to analysts, the number of EV on the world’s roads will continue to rise on an accelerated pace. 
The International Energy Agency, for one, predicts there will be 125 million EVs worldwide by 2030. The number, it says, can potentially double to high as 220 million if governments stepped up the pace of legislative change to encourage the adoption of EVs.
At present, Asia remains the leading growth market for EVs, driven predominantly by China, with South Korea and Japan trailing behind. Meanwhile, India is now also seeing demand for EVs rising, and contributing to the market growth in the region.

 
 
 
 
Last year, 2.1 million new EVs were sold worldwide, with China accounting for 57% of the share, or 1.2 million units.
The United States came in second, accounting for 17%, or 361,000 units, of new EVs sold globally, driven by the launch of new Tesla 3 model.
US-based Tesla is one the key players of the global EV industry. The other key players in the market include Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Hyundai.
Meanwhile, the growing pressure to go green has prompted several European countries to implement a ban on the sale of new fossil-fuelled vehicles in the longer term. For instance, Germany will reportedly stop the sale of new petrol and diesel fuelled cars by 2030. Scotland is expected to follow suit by 2032, and France by 2040.
All this points to a bright future for EVs. It is unsurprising therefore that there is a rush by so many companies to enter the EV industry."

Interband Group of Companies senior trader Jim Teh said however, physical buying of palm oil and palm oil products among Muslim countries, including some provinces in China would increase as the fasting month of Ramadan nears.
""We expect CPO may likely trade between RM2,100 and RM2,150 per tonne amid lower inventories that are currently below three million tonnes,” he told Bernama.
Commenting on China’s interest in buying more palm oil and palm oil related products from Malaysia, Teh said it is a welcome news to industry players, but the support would be for a short term.
""Do not forget that in the commodity market, be it CPO, soya bean, sugar, gold and rubber… there is always a cycle.
""When the prices go up, they will somehow come down and repeat themselves again,” he said.
To make the prices more sustainable, Teh said law enforcement should be tightened to cut out the middlemen or brokers.
He said as the production cost currently stands at about RM1,500 per tonne, smallholders and growers are not earning much due to the existence of intermediaries.
""Even though the licence for brokers and middlemen was abolished by the authorities some years ago, they are still around, taking the role of agents to smallholders, millers and refineries.
""This should not be happening. If we can buy an insurance policy directly from banks without engaging any agents, why can’t we do the same for the palm oil industry?” said Teh, adding that if brokers and middlemen could be eradicated, there would be more cost savings, while restoring integrity and ethical practices in the industry.

The Belt and Road Initiative is a key policy of President Xi Jinping and envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.

But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects.

The United States has been particularly critical of Italy's decision to sign up to the plan last month, the first for a G7 nation.

In an apparent nod to these concerns, the communique reiterates promises reached at the last summit in 2017 for sustainable financing - but adds a line on debt, which was not included the last time.

""We support collaboration among national and international financial institutions to provide diversified and sustainable financial supports for projects,"" the draft communique reads.

""We encourage local currency financing, mutual establishment of financial institutions, and a greater role of development finance in line with respective national priorities, laws, regulations and international commitments, and the agreed principles by the UNGA on debt sustainability,"" it added, referring to the United Nations General Assembly.

The word ""green"" appears in the draft seven times. It was not mentioned once in the summit communique from two years ago.

""We underline the importance of promoting green development,"" the draft reads. ""We encourage the development of green finance including the issuance of green bonds as well as development of green technology.""

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/no-oversupply-fear/,"Bandar Malaysia's 10,000 units will not affect the affordable market",Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"10,000 units of affordable housing planned for Bandar Malaysia won’t affect overall property market  
PETALING JAYA: The building of 10,000 units of affordable housing in the revived Bandar Malaysia will not result in an oversupply because there is a lack of them in the city, property consultants, an economist and government housing agency PR1MA said.
The project is located on the site of the former Royal Malaysian Air Force base in Sg Besi, Kuala Lumpur.
Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia chairman Tan Sri Eddy Chen said: “PR1MA does not have many new units in Kuala Lumpur. The location will benefit those in the bottom and middle 40 income group as Bandar Malaysia is to be built as a transportation hub with connectivity to match.
“As a new mixed commercial/residential township, many job opportunities will be created for all strata of skill-level people. The affordable houses built will help this strata of workforce live near their workplace,” he said, adding that he believed private developers would hope that they would be given an opportunity to participate in the affordable housing development there.
The proposed 10,000 affordable houses will not impact the current oversupply of residential homes in the Klang Valley as the majority of unsold units are not in that category, property consultant VPC Alliance managing director James Wong said.
Property consultant Khong & Jaafar managing director Elvin Fernandez said the reinstatement of Bandar Malaysia, from a top-down perspective, ought to be good for the socio-economic growth and development of Malaysia.
“However, in view of the substantial oversupply of high-end residentials, office and retail space, it may be prudent to undertake the entire project, each phase and sub-phase only after high-level, detailed, independent, market and feasibility studies and only proceed with the development, subject to the overall dictates of these studies.
Elvin said such studies should also be updated periodically to accommodate changes in the property market going forward.
Any special incentives, whether tax or otherwise, that may have to be given for the project, should only come after deep and due consideration, so that it does not disadvantage property owners who have invested capital in comparable properties in the larger neighbourhood of Bandar Malaysia.
Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said Bandar Malaysia will have a new narrative with regard to affordable housing to empower the lower-income group in relation to home ownership and renting in Bandar Malaysia.
“There are various initiatives being planned,” she said in a statement on Saturday.
Different views with regard to Malaysia’s softened stand on reviving Bandar Malaysia have popped up a week after a similar reversal with the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).
While Forbes said the “irrational” behaviour of both cases suggests that Malaysia is already “caught in China’s web” from which “there is no escape”, those contacted on home ground have so far viewed the about-turn more positively.
Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie said there is “nothing wrong to revert the decision if the revived projects like ECRL and Bandar Malaysia meet the vigorous and robust assessment of cost-benefit, economic and financing viability”.“The government had initiated a thorough and objective review of high-impact projects to ascertain their viability, full costs and benefits, including the mode of financing within the government’s budget and debt constraints.
“The review also includes looking at the aspects of fair price negotiation to eliminate the element of corruption, shady deals and inflated cost as well as lop-sided agreement,” he said.
This review had resulted in the deferment of some projects, axing of those deemed non-critical at this juncture, massive cost savings for the continuation of LRT3 and MRT2, and the revival of ECRL.
The more important consideration is the projects would serve as domestic economic growth generator and stabiliser over the medium term in order to partially cushion against the negative spillovers from unstable external environment, Lee said.
“The biggest challenge for Bandar Malaysia is to position itself as a competitive regional information and communications technology (ICT), commerce and business and transportation hub,” Lee said.
Malaysia must aspire to be a global city supported by its commercial, financial, transportation, telecommunications, and information links. It cannot be just a regional hub city.As for the 10,000 units affordable housing, pending what constitutes “affordable” price range in Bandar Malaysia, that is not expected to cause a significant impact on public and private developers.
Last week, the government said among the tweaks to the revived plan is the building of 10,000 affordable housing units to ensure that the low- and middle-income households are not left out of urban-city development. The government also added a people’s park.
VPC Alliance’s Wong said the resuscitation of Bandar Malaysia is “a clear balancing act of taking care of national interest with the building of 10,000 units of affordable homes, construction of a people’s park and international interest”.
“It will result in stronger ties with China, with China Railway Engineering Corp as the foreign partner in the consortium and with Bandar Malaysia being part of the Belt and Road initiative,” he said."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/smebiz/2019/04/22/made-for-work-and-leisure/,Made for work and leisure,SMEBiz,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"VIQ Apparel is riding a hot streak.

Founded by husband-and-wife team Kevin Kong and Vivian Ng, who saw a market gap for sportswear that could transition seamlessly from studio to street, the company is winning recognition as a leading local athleisure brand.
Last year was a particularly good year. Total revenue cracked the million-ringgit mark, an amount that is expected to double this year, and the company emerged as Best Brand in Fashion and Sports Apparel at the 2018 International Prestige Brand Awards.
Kong, 31, and Ng, 29, remain modest about their achievements and believe they can do better.
But they’ve come a long way from their humble beginnings, when their tiny rented apartment doubled as a warehouse and Kong would make deliveries on his motorcycle to save on courier charges.
Going into the clothing line was inspired by Kong’s then-girlfriend Ng, his junior in Universiti Sains Malaysia who was widely admired for her fashion sense.


Growing team: ViQ currently has about 20 people under its employment.


When university mates started asking where she got her clothes, the enterprising young lady saw the opportunity to make some pocket money. She started buying in bulk from Taobao and selling them to her course mates via Facebook.
Back in 2010, online sales were still a novelty, and she did a roaring trade. So much so, Kong had to manage her business when she went to Sweden for a student exchange programme.
Experiencing the business process first hand, Kong saw the untapped potential of the fashion market and thought it worth exploring. While holding down his day job as a finance analyst, he attended night classes to pick up skills in creating websites and using Photoshop.
In 2013, he quit his job to start a clothing business with Ng, who graduated that year. They named the company ViQ, a sporty truncation of Ng’s name.
While Ng’s father, a logistics service provider in Johor, was supportive of their endeavour, Kong’s parents had a different reaction. His father and mother – a hardware shop assistant and petrol station clerk respectively – thought Kong was crazy to leave a high-paying job in a multinational corporation for a risky venture.


Close partnership: ViQ works closely with its manufacturer to ensure quality standards are met.


But that was precisely his motivation. Having seen his parents struggle to raise the family, Kong saw business as a way to break through the poverty cycle.
“At university, I was known as the guy who never orders more than RM3.50 for lunch. Business was my best chance to build a comfortable life for my loved ones,” he says.
A grown-up business
The idealistic couple soon learn that running a grown-up business was a far cry from selling clothes online for fun.
Initially, they sourced their clothes from an apparel original equipment manufacturer (OEM) who was an acquaintance of Ng’s father.


Direct to consumers: The company regularly organises pop-up stores and road shows to connect with consumers.


“That way, it was easier for us to control the supply chain, especially on the design and quality assurance matters, compared to buying from Taobao,” explains Kong.
In the first few months of business, they found that the spandex long pants range was the top seller.
Capitalising on this observation, Ng designed her own sportswear line. She made a few rough sketches of her ideal sportswear and persuaded the apparel maker to turn her designs into real prototypes.
Using his newly acquired skills, Kong built a website to sell their products but the pair felt they needed a brick-and-mortar store for brand exposure.
Strapped for cash, they rented a retail outlet in a rundown mall in Penang. At RM1,300, it was the cheapest they could afford. To keep expenses low, Kong personally delivered products to their customers using his motorcycle.
“If we use Poslaju, I have to pay RM6 per delivery – enough to cover one week’s worth of fuel!” he points out.
Ng also gave up on some indulgences. Outings to cafes were a luxury she couldn’t afford at this critical stage in their business.
But foot traffic was low in their first location, causing them to relocate to a hypermarket.
Unfortunately, it did not give them the kind of customers they were hoping for.
“The crowd that comes to hypermarkets is the same week after week. It’s very different from a shopping destination like Ipoh Parade or Kinta City, where new customers come looking for fresh trends,” he says.
After a challenging year, they decided to cut their losses and relocate to Ipoh.
The stability of being on home ground gave the couple breathing room to recalibrate. One thing’s for sure – they were not giving up their entrepreneurship dreams.
Regroup and recalibrate
Around this time, fitness awareness was rising in Malaysia and that itself spun off another interesting trend.
“People love to take selfies in the gym and post them up on social media. They don’t want to wear the same thing two days in a row. I’m definitely guilty of that myself,” Ng laughs. “We knew that the market for athleisure was definitely emerging.”
 

 
Reenergised by this insight, the couple decided to employ a different strategy.
One of the things they did was to recruit fitness instructors to sell their products. “Students trust and are receptive to the recommendations of their teachers,” Ng reasons.
This strategy paid off. Today, the agents they have engaged nationwide contribute a sizeable 10% of their revenue.
They knew creating brand awareness was crucial for a new player. But instead of taking out advertisements, they decided to do pop-up stores and road shows.
“During road shows, you get instant cash. Moreover, you can explain your products directly to the customers so it’s more efficient marketing. Direct customer interaction also helps us to come up with designs based on real demand.
“Speed to market is important. It’s one of the core strategies of successful brands like Zara,” says Kong.
After a year of doing the road show circuit, they grew enough confidence to open a retail store in Ipoh.
“We had a mature fan base who told us they wanted to buy our products but didn’t know how to find us once road shows were over, so we felt it was high time to have a permanent location,” he adds.
From selling a mix of OEM and their own products, ViQ has pivoted to creating their own designs. Although the actual production is outsourced to the same manufacturer, ViQ fully manages the research and development process and oversees quality control.
To facilitate this, the couple leased a space in the manufacturer’s factory to serve as their headquarters.
“The manufacturer functions like our close business partner. We complement each other in many ways but of course we hope to convert ourselves into a full original brand manufacturer one day,” says Ng.
Between road shows and managing the business, their hard work and sacrifices are gradually paying off. ViQ’s staff has grown to 20 strong and they have expanded to four retail outlets in prime locations, including their flagship store in Paradigm Mall, Petaling Jaya.
Kong also finally upgraded from his Yamaha motorcycle to a Honda City in 2016.
When asked about the one thing they wish they’d done differently, Ng doesn’t hesitate: “Choosing a bad location based on lowest cost. Although rental was cheap, our first outlet didn’t generate much revenue. During our first year, we didn’t draw a salary for eight months.”
As for Kong, he believes he initially spent too much time on operations.
Perfectly organised
“I’m not sure if it’s my personality or the education system that trains me to do something in a certain way, but I wanted things to be systematic. I’ve learned that in business, there is no such thing as getting things perfectly organised – the tagging, categorising the products, warehousing.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/three-ipos-in-the-worksfor-dubai/,Three IPOs in the worksfor Dubai,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"DUBAI: Three companies are preparing initial public offerings on Dubai’s main stock exchange, the bourse said, potentially ending a 17-month drought as it boosts efforts to entice local firms to list domestically rather than abroad.“We are at different stages of discussions with potential issuers including three companies from the industry, oil and gas services as well as healthcare sectors,” exchange operator Dubai Financial Market PJSC said in an emailed response to questions. The timing of the deals is up to the companies, it said.Liquidity in Dubai’s main stock market has slumped in the past four years as a drop in oil prices hampered economies across the Gulf, reducing trading volumes and slowing share sales. The last IPO on the DFM was in late 2017, when Emaar Development PJSC sold US$1.3bil in new shares. Last week, Dubai-based Network International raised US$1.4bil for a London listing.The stock exchange is working with local regulators to encourage initial share sales, including enabling companies based in the emirate’s economic free zones to access the market. Two such companies are considering IPOs through an electronic platform that’s in development, according to DFM.The bourse is also looking to increase the representation of tourism, retail, healthcare and education among listed companies. About 75% of the members of Dubai’s main gauge are from the financial or real estate sectors. The benchmark, which posted five consecutive weeks of gains as of Thursday, has risen 11% this year, after a loss of 25% in 2018, its worst performance in a decade. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/trumps-lng-push-helps-power-german-green-cruise-liner-boom/,Trump’s LNG push helps power German green cruise liner boom,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"BERLIN: President Donald Trump’s bid to dump a glut of liquefied natural gas on Europe is getting an unlikely boost: stringent regulations on shipping emissions that are prompting the continent’s shipyards to hunt for alternatives to high-polluting diesel.The International Maritime Organization will clamp down next year on sulfur and carbon emissions from diesel-powered ships. That’s sparked a hunt for less-polluting fuels, with the global glut in LNG luring European cruise and non-cargo lines to turn to the fuel. And it’s benefiting shipyards in Germany, home to the world’s largest merchant navy fleet, which are tapping a booming cruise industry.“Germany can’t make LNG cruise ships fast enough - we’re top of the shop right now,” said Ralf Soeren Marquardt, managing director of the VSM German shipbuilders federation, on the phone from Hamburg last week.“Special shipbuilding in which Germany led for so long is getting a huge boost.”All but two of 11 cruise ships on order at Meyer Werft GmbH’s Cloppenburg wharf on the North Sea are LNG-propelled. The wharf’s order books are full to 2023, spokesman Guenther Kolbe said Thursday by phone.  In November, the yard finished the 180,000-tonne AIDAnova liner, the world’s first LNG cruise ship. Owner Carnival Corp & Plc, the world’s largest leisure travel enterprise, aims to boost its LNG fleet by 11 ships in coming years.Germany’s leading shipping financiers including NordLB AG and Commerzbank AG are winding wind down their loan portfolios. The government and its development bank KfW Group are stepping in to help finance construction of LNG liners.LNG propulsion is 20% to 30% more expensive than diesel motors and the government subsidizes as much as 60 percent of the higher costs, said George Ehrmann, managing director of Germany’s Maritime LNG Platform, which promotes the new technology.Just 0.4% of total global shipping by tonnage is made up of cruise ships but the sector’s switch to LNG will in time give a lift to other German special shipping such as research ships and offshore wind installation ships, and to diesel-to-LNG conversion equipment, Ehrmann said in an interview earlier this month. Germany has been slow to warm to LNG’s possibilities and is the only major European market without an import terminal for the fuel. Until mid-decade, the government in Berlin rebuffed pressure from Group of Seven partners including the US and Japan to broaden the diversity of its natural gas supplies, touting instead its reliance on pipeline gas. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/22/tesla-takes-short-seller-to-court/,Tesla takes short seller to court,Business News,"Monday, 22 Apr 2019",,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk’s war with Tesla Inc short sellers just got weirder.The electric carmaker claims a California man who it says is part of an online group of short sellers has been stalking its Fremont factory and harassing its employees - including dangerously swerving his car toward a Tesla Model 3 that was on a freeway test drive and injuring a Tesla security guard in a hit-and-run on company property.Tesla persuaded a state court judge on Friday to issue a temporary restraining order requiring the man to stay at least 100 yards away from its factory and employees.The bizarre events described in court filings, first reported by the website Electrek, prompted a tweet from Musk on Saturday.Ten minutes later came a response from the Twitter handle @skabooshka -- the very account that Tesla says belongs to the man that’s been menacing its employees.Tesla claims it was able to identify the harasser as Randeep Hothi from the license plate of the vehicle he drove - and that it also traced Hothi to the Twitter account he allegedly shares with his brother that frequently tweets with the hashtag “$TSLAQ” in solidarity with others who want to see the company fail.Hothi’s behavior would likely cause “great or irreparable harm” absent immediate court intervention, the company said in its petition for the restraining order.Hothi didn’t immediately respond Saturday to a request for comment. A legal defense fund set up for Hothi garnered US$23,578 in contributions from 87 people in one hour, surpassing its goal of US$20,000.It’s not the first time that Tesla and Musk have gone to great lengths to stop what they perceive as threats to the company.A former assembly line worker at Tesla’s Nevada Gigafactory who the company identified as leaking disparaging information to the media was accused by Musk of engaging in “extensive and damaging sabotage,” and Tesla’s public relations department spread rumors that he was homicidal.In an earlier episode, Tesla sued an executive for an oil industry company whom it accused of impersonating Musk in an email to get nonpublic data about the automaker. That case ended with a confidential settlement.Tesla claims that Hothi - who it says lives less than three miles from its Fremont factory - had a history of trespassing at its facilities, taking photos and video to post to his Twitter account, before he recently started menacing its employees.In February, the company said in a court filing, a security guard on foot approached Hothi in his vehicle to ask him to leave the factory parking lot and Hothi’s car then hit the guard -- causing a minor knee injury - before fleeing the scene. Tesla says it contacted Fremont police, but that officers were unable to deliver a no-trespassing order to Hothi.On April 16, the company alleges, Hothi was behind the wheel of an Acura that variously drove ahead of, beside and behind a Tesla-owned Model 3 on the freeway for a period of 35 minutes -- while Hothi was taking pictures of the Model 3. The Acura swerved so close to the Model 3 that the vehicle’s side-collision safety feature engaged in an emergency maneuver to avoid a collision, according to the court filing.The Oakland judge set a hearing for May 7. – Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/the-tiger-woods-act-is-not-for-malaysia/,The ‘Tiger Woods’ act is not for Malaysia,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"A month before the one-year anniversary of Pakatan Harapan’s ruling the government, Malaysia has earned the accolades of being a “boring” and under-performing stock market. The ringgit, which is the thermometer to gauge the economy, has weakened after the initial euphoria of appreciating as high as RM4 against the US dollar.An economist had said that Malaysia without the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is too dependent on oil revenue. Budget 2019 was based on crude oil at US$70 and considering that the year-to-date average is lower, the country would not be able to keep to spending limits.Ironically, the story of Malaysia’s being a “boring and under-performing” stock came as golfer Tiger Woods made a remarkable comeback to win his first major tournament since 2008. That was the time when the golfer’s on-course performance started to go downhill due to injuries and “off-course” affairs that led to a broken-marriage.Sponsors stayed away from Tiger Woods and he lived with a tag as a great golfing talent that never made it. Now he is seen as a role model in the story of triumph against adversity. Woods US Masters win is now repeated as a story of why one must never give up and the fruits of labour will finally pay off.Sadly, it only applies in the world of sports. In the sporting world, there are clear rules and everybody play within the rules or they are disqualified. Sports world is based on meritocracy. If you good and talented, you would be found - some way or other - even if you live in Borneo.Sarawak has produced amongst Malaysia’s best sprinter and diver in Watson Nyambek and Pandelela Rinong who proved their worth based on merit.Running a government to please people with different demands is not so easy. Meritocracy is only a slogan. It reality, it is hard to implement.For instance, the government’s bail-out of Felda and Tabung Haji are seen as further straining the country’s balance sheet. The fear that the of Budget 2019 objective of keeping fiscal deficit at 3.4% cannot be achieved considering that the government has to fork out RM6bil to rescue Felda.However, what investors fail to realise is that the government cannot afford not to bail out the likes of Felda and Tabung Haji. It cannot operate completely on meritocracy and go by the book strictly because there are political considerations to weigh on.Felda needs to be rescued because of the massive mismanagement of funds. It involves the lives of 120,000 settlers and many more, if their families are taken into account. The Felda settlers are important voter bank and determine 52 parliament seats.Most of them are Malays who form the bulk of the voting population of the country as a whole.Whether we like or not, issues that Felda and Tabung Haji face has to be resolved if there is to be any political stability.The only consolation is that those who are responsible for the mismanagement of Felda, Tabung Haji, 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) would eventually pay a price.In communist China, these people would have faced the firing squad. In Malaysia, it takes time to penalise those responsible under the law. Pakatan Harapan’s messaging to investors is that it provides accountability, transparency and discipline in running the government. It revealed the total debts and a bigger budget deficit for 2019 and left it to investors to decide if they are prepared to put money in the country.That it does not tolerate corruption is a message that is being drummed countless times.Is there is a premium in being transparent, accountable and standing firm against corruption? Yes there is. But as a fund manager says, it does not tell investors where to put their money.It does not tell investors if there is going to be a continuity to the government’s policies and who the next Prime Minister is going to be after Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. The fund manager says that Malaysia needs to tell another story, apart from governance and transparency.Towards this end, a good line of messaging would be on addressing the political transition after Dr Mahathir.The fund manager is right in his argument because long term capital needs political stability and leadership certainty.Dr Mahathir, who is named as among the most powerful persons by Time Magazine, probably knows best why he is delaying in setting a firm time table to hand over power to the only person who has been named so far, which is Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.Probably because the minute Dr Mahathir announces the time-table to handover, he would be a lame duck Prime Minister, a role the 93-year veteran politician would not relish.Apart from politics, the other matter bogging investors is the slowing Malaysian economy.The concern is that the economic growth of 4.5% would not be met and that Bank Negara would be forced to bring down the interest rates. When interest rates are down because of a slowing economy, it dampens sentiments on the ringgit and puts yields of bonds under pressure.The prospects of a lower yield and weakening currency are just the catalysts needed for bond investors to take some money off the table.The unfavourable rating by little known Russel Fund Index earlier this week did not help matters. The end result is that the government bonds are under pressure and so is the ringgit.The government should keep up with doing the things it can best do, which are enhancing transparency, governance and being more careful in handling public funds. Investors will view with scepticism until they see hard numbers on the economy and consistency in growth.The Malaysian stock market was among the world’s best in 1993 on the back of a roaring economy that started its growth path some four years earlier.The economy over-heated, the government got carried away with spending and we paid a heavy price by the ringgit and stock market crashing. It all came down with a thud in 1997.The Pakatan Harapan government wants to see Malaysia be a “tiger economy” once again.But it would not be easy. The road ahead is treacherous with lots of obstacles – balancing the demands of the political and social agenda.We cannot do it the Tiger Woods way because there is no meritocracy when it comes to governing a country. But we will get there eventually as long as we stay the course."

THE dollar strengthened for the third consecutive week. It rose 0.55% to 97.5 on the back of a string of strong economic data. 
The March retail sales reported an upside surprise of 1.6% m-o-m from a contraction of 0.2% m-o-m in February and beating market expectation of +0.9%. Moreover, the drop in initial jobless claims to 192,000 compared with the previous week’s 197,000 suggested the sustained health of the US economy. 
The good progression in trade talks with Japan and China helped to shrug off the shortfall in March’s industrial output. Industrial production came in at -0.1% m/m from a +0.1% increase in February, below its consensus of +0.2% m-o-m. 
However, the manufacturing PMI remained unchanged at 52.4 in April while the service PMI declined to 52.9 from the previous month’s 55.3.

In the commodity market, Brent crude oil prices edged up 1.11% to US$71.97/bbl as signs of a global supply tightening intensified. The de facto leader of Opec, Saudi Arabia, lowered its output by 277,000 barrels to just under seven million barrels per day (mbpd) in February, according to data from the Joint Organisation Data Initiative. 
Along with the unexpected drawdown of 1.40mb in US inventories and the receding fears of demand growth, these fuelled the rise in oil prices and posted a year-to-date gain of 33.8%. However, the strengthening dollar kept a lid on the gain.
The euro fell 0.65% to 1.123 mainly due to the stronger dollar coupled with disappointing economic release. Economic release for the week includes:  February’s industrial production recording a smaller decline of 0.3% y-o-y from -0.7% y-o-y in previous month; and the manufacturing PMI est for April continuing to stay in the contraction region for the third consecutive month. 
The manufacturing PMI read at 47.8 in April from 47.5 a month earlier and below the market expectation of 47.9. 
The poor manufacturing data signals the balance of risk to the economy is still tilted to the downside.
In the meantime, the sterling dropped below the 1.30 level to 1.299, a 0.83% fall for the week. The February labour market showed the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.9% with wages growing slightly to 3.4% y-o-y from 3.5% y-o-y in January. Furthermore, retail sales posted a strong reading in March, up 1.1% m-o-m from 0.6% m-o-m in the previous month.  
The yen strengthened 0.06% to 112.97 as the April manufacturing PMI approached the “50” expansion/contraction demarcation. It read at 49.5 from the 49.2 a month earlier as input and output prices climbed. However, the fall of 2.7% in March exports from -1.2% y-o-y in February dampen the outlook for Japan’s economy, along with the February industrial output finalising at -1.1% y-o-y from a gain of 0.7% y-o-y in January.
Asian ex-Japan currencies generally weakened across the board owing to a stronger greenback save for the Indian rupee and rupiah. The rupiah added 0.13% to 14,045 as the incumbent Joko Widodo was successfully re-elected president for his second and final term. 
The equities market witnessed a strong foreign inflow of US$102mil post-election result.
Meanwhile, the yuan remained largely unchanged for the week, hovering between 6.68 and 6.71. Earlier in the week, the yuan strengthened post-1Q2019 GDP data of 6.4% y-o-y (4Q’18: 6.4%; cons: 6.3%), but it pared gains after uncertainty rose on the sustainability of China’s GDP.
The ringgit was the second-worst performer in the region following a slew of negative headlines on the economy starting off with speculations that Malaysian bonds were at risk of being dropped from the FTSE World Government Bond Index. Selling pressure continued mid-week after Moody’s rating agency commented that the government’s financial aid of RM6.2bil to Felda is credit negative. Meanwhile, the local bourse shed 0.7% to 1,625 over the week while recording a net foreign outflow of RM374mil.
US Treasuries (UST) Market 
Amid a short working week as markets were closed on Friday due to Good Friday holiday, the yield curve eased on the back of weak manufacturing across the globe. 
Strong buying flows were seen across the US Treasuries after reports of weak manufacturing PMI from France, Germany and Japan. These pressured the yields, especially the ones on the shorter end, and also tempered the earlier selling pressure.
The weak manufacturing PMI indicated the second quarter could start on a softer tone. As at Friday, the 2-, 5-, and 10-year benchmark UST yields stands at 2.38%, 2.37%, and 2.56% respectively.
Malaysian Bond Market
A slew of negative news put pressure on Malaysian govvies in which we saw yields adding 8.1–15.8bps across all tenors with the five-year MGS climbing the most. 
It started with the risk of Malaysian bonds being excluded from the FTSE World Government Bond Index. The selling pressure then continued after Moody’s credit negative comment with regards to the government’s aid to Felda. At Friday’s noon pricing, the 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year benchmark MGS yields settled at 3.49%, 3.69%, 3.87%, 3.89%, 4.26%, 4.44% and 4.69% respectively.
The Markit iBoxx ABF Malaysia Bond Index, an index comprising the MGS, GII and GG, returned -0.449% in the week from April 11 to April 18 as the index yield went up to 3.86% from 3.78%. 
In the same period, the ABF Malaysia Bond Index Fund , an ETF which tracks the index, posted a return of -0.516% in the NAV as the fund yield jumped from 3.82% to 3.89%. Month to date, the fund returned -0.305% versus -0.183% return posted by the index.
Flows for local govvies spiked 23.8% to RM920.84bil compared with last week’s RM16.83bil. 
The MGS space which consisted of 53% of the total activities increased 12.2% to RM11.03bil from RM9.83 in the previous week while flows for GII surged 40.0% to RM9.56bil. Meanwhile, we noticed the activity level in short-term bills jumping 51.2% to RM254mil in this week.
On the contrary, trading activities at the corporate bond space slowed to RM1.89bil versus last week’s RM5.04bil. Some 75% of the trading volume was from the GG/AAA segment which saw a decrease to RM1.41bil from RM3.63bil. Besides, 18% were from the AA segment and the remaining 7% from the A segment.
Amid a relatively quiet week in the PDS market, strong interest in the GG/AAA segment was garnered in 2022-2049 DanaInfra Nasional Bhd tranches which saw yields closing between 3.701% and 4.659% with RM465mil traded. 
Some interest was also seen in Prasarana Malaysia Bhd 2020-2042 tranches which saw yields settling at the range of 3.554%-4.499% on the back of RM250mil traded. Lastly, ‘20-29 tranches from Pengurus Air SPV Bhd saw yields traded between 3.580% and 4.063% with RM170mil traded.
In the AA segment, interest was seen in the energy sector with Edra Energy Sdn Bhd’s 2025–2038 tranches posting a volume of RM104mil with yields falling 0.3-30bps to 5.209%–6.139%. 
Besides, Fortune Premiere Sdn Bhd 2023-2025 tranches yields closed 0.1 – 12bps lower at 4.366%-4.517% on the back of RM42mil traded. Also from the property sector, ‘03/23 Gamuda Bhd  Islamic bonds saw RM40mil traded with yields 1bps lower at 4.459%. 
Ringgit Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Market 
The IRS curve was seen steepening from across the curve by 5.5–9.0bps. As at Friday’s noon pricing, the 3-month KLIBOR stood at 3.69%. Elsewhere, the 5-year CDS was lower by 1.7% to 52.7.

Despite the RM10bil size of its asset under management, the fund plays a significant role in the local stock market with its controlling stakes in some of the major listed companies.
There is great interest in what kind of changes chief executive Nik Amlizan Mohamed will embark on. With her experience in Retirement Fund Inc (KWAP), the country’s largest pension fund, her role in LTAT marks a new era for the fund.
She believes that putting the right framework in place and tweaking the investment portfolio is vital for the fund to move forward. The following are excerpts of an interview with her.
What are some of the new aspects you have introduced as part of LTAT’s transformation? We recently set up a human resources (HR) department. In the past, HR functions mainly revolved around administrative work and not from a strategic perspective.
We have also set up a Legal and Secretarial Department, which is important as we need to get the house in order.
Our compliance function did not exist. Hence, we needed to create a compliance function inside risk management.
That was part of the reason why LTAT was found to be not keeping up with the standards of compliance as per our announcement pertaining to our financial year 2017 (FY17) results in Parliament last week.
We revisited the risk enterprise framework and when I asked for this, I was informed that it was introduced in 2004 and had not been revisited since.
There are so many new risks which have evolved since then. How do you address Black Swan events? We have to prepare ourselves for the future.
LTAT has been doing well in the past and when you are experiencing good times, you may not necessarily want to think about the bad times. But that has to change because the future looks nothing like the past. Is the fund agile enough to face that?
One of the major risks is that the fund’s investments are highly concentrated in very few investments.
LTAT is known for its dividend payments of an average of 11.3% per annum in the last 45 years. Can it keep up with the dividend payment track record?In 2017, LTAT announced a
6% cash dividend based on both the full members’ and government’s contributions amounting to RM498mil. The 6.5% special bonus, which is based only on
the members’ contribution and paid in the form of a unit trust fund managed by Affin Hwang Unit Trust, amounted to RM188mil.
What is important to note here is that the first 6% payout amount is a lot larger than the second 6.5% payout amount. This is because there is a different base used.
Therefore, we cannot simply add both amounts when the base is different.
For example, if you use your car 30% of the time and I use my car 20% of the time, I cannot say that we both use our cars 50% of the time. It is simply incorrect.
We have rebased, with the 6.0% plus 6.5% in this case actually being equivalent to 8.3%, which is still highly commendable.
So, it was not 12.5% in dividends that was given in 2018?It was not 12.5% because the bases were different. The amount of dividend paid for FY17 was RM686mil and this was higher than the income for the year – particularly after it was adjusted. The money for the dividend came from retained earnings and it is alright to do so, because it is also to manage the volatility in terms of dividends. But it should not cause retained earnings to fall into negative territory.
With the negative retained earnings, what do you do from here, moving forward?This question keeps me up at night – it is my bread-and-butter question. We need to work very, very hard to recover the accumulated losses.
Being a passive fund manager, does LTAT need to have controlling stakes in listed companies including Boustead Holdings Bhd , Boustead Plantations Bhd , Pharmaniaga Bhd  and Affin Bank Bhd?If passive here means buying and holding for the long term, then LTAT would need to review and rebalance intermittently to ensure the decision to hold these securities remains intact.
This may not necessarily work anymore in this day and age.
Essentially, we are waiting for the dividends to come in. We should not be at the mercy of our investee companies.
It cannot be the case that due to the heavy exposure that we have in one company, we are unable to be flexible with our investments.
To have control over our investee companies is good, but to allow them to control LTAT funds simply because of our high exposure to them is unwise.
High holdings of the investee companies’ paid-up capital is different from high fund exposure to the investee companies.
That is to say that LTAT should not hold more than 10% of its fund size in one single company for prudence and diversification purposes.
How much is your exposure in Boustead? Are you looking to reduce your stake in it?We own 59.4% of Boustead Holdings. From our fund size, approximately 28% is placed here.
Moving forward, the market will be volatile and we need to be ready to be able to move our funds.
LTAT is a pension Fund. LTAT is not Boustead, and Boustead is not LTAT. The same applies to Affin. These are our investee companies.
If they perform well, which they have done in the past, we will keep them, to a certain level. Not to a level where we cannot move.
We would not undertake or change anything that would not benefit the soldiers.
We can take our time...not right now. When the time is right, we may look at scaling down, as the current stake is high.
There are ways to do it. For example, increasing other investments using new funds so that the exposure percentage will effectively be lower.
As a fund, do you steer the direction of your investee companies?As a shareholder, we practise shareholder activism via engagements. It would be very irresponsible for us not to do so.
We would not want to just buy and not do anything. We have been and will continue to engage with the Affin Bank and Boustead management and their respective boards to ensure they are clear on our expectations.
Moving forward, they cannot be worse off than the market. It needs to be better. There is
deep value in both Boustead and Affin. It is a matter of unlocking it and looking at ways to create value.
LTAT is also involved in property development and recently submitted a new proposal to win back the Klang Valley Double Track Phase 2 (KVDT2) contract. Why is a fund management house involved in such projects? What role does LTAT play and what kind of returns are you aiming for?For KVDT2, LTAT is a minority shareholder with a 20% stake in the joint-venture company. We envisage receiving some returns from the project if we are successful in our bid.
Currently, it is still premature to talk about it, as we only recently resubmitted our bid to the government.
Our investment philosophy moving forward is to look at brownfields and no longer greenfields. I want us to participate in businesses that are already generating an income stream, or better still, bottom-line growth.
Have you received payment for your Bandar Malaysia project?LTAT’s wholly owned subsidiary - Perbadanan Perwira Harta Malaysia (PPHM) - was tasked with the relocation and construction of eight bases. Except for some balance for the final works done, PPHM has been reimbursed for the bulk of the work done.
When you came into office in October last year, how did you describe LTAT and what was your impression of the firm? Was there are proper handover done by your predecessor? LTAT reminds me of KWAP back in 2007 when I first joined as the head of equity. My 11 years at KWAP taught me a lot about leadership and organisational structure. I am hoping to do the same, if not more, for LTAT.
The responsibilities are a lot more here and I am trying to
do it within a shorter period of time.
It’s like “trying to change the tyres while the car is moving”.
My first two weeks were spent speaking to our 260 team members here at LTAT. I knew then that they have been looking for change.
In the past, heads of departments had never presented to the board. Now, they have to do so to the board and the investment panel.
Currently, we do not have succession planning and we do not have talent management in terms of up-skilling and reskilling.

She felt the job at LTAT was one that she could not pass up on, and appears energetic and driven in explaining her plans to transform LTAT to make the fund more sustainable in deriving its income.For LTAT, the diversification of its investment portfolio would be a historical change, as it has long been known as an equities investor with much of its exposure in having controlling stakes in a handful of companies.Shockingly, Nik Amlizan reveals that LTAT has very little exposure in the fixed-income market and that 60% of the fund’s investment is in the equity market.“Almost 28% of our AUM (assets under management) is in the Boustead group alone, and yes, we are looking at ways to balance this portfolio,” she says, adding that the fund is looking to invest in more listed companies.“We need to be agile enough to move in line with the market. I’m bullish on the market for the long term, so I need to get LTAT ready when the opportunity comes,” she adds. At present, LTAT has invested in around 30 companies on Bursa Malaysia and aims to spread its resources to 50 companies.For the sake of comparison, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which has RM814bil in AUM, has invested 50.53% of its money in fixed income and 41.6% in equities. Meanwhile, KWAP, a RM145bil fund, has invested 46% in fixed income and 40% in equities. Related story:Nik Amlizan’s challenge is like trying to change tyres while the car is moving"

Growth may slow to the low 3% range in the first and second quarters, he told reporters here.“We want the measures to be effective during the second and third quarters in order to make sure the economy won’t be slumping when the new government comes in,” he said.The steps being mulled include tax breaks to spur tourism and assistance for people on low incomes, he said.Pro-military and anti-junta parties are tussling to form a government after a disputed and inconclusive general election in March, following almost five years of military rule.The central bank warned the economy could be affected if the process of forming the next administration drags on to August or later.Such a delay could affect the implementation of the national budget, public-sector projects and private-sector investment decisions, Bank of Thailand Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said at a seminar in Bangkok yesterday.The central bank’s forecast of 3.8% gross domestic product growth in 2019 -- close to the country’s potential of about 4 percent -- assumes a government is in place by June, Veerathai said. It’s too early to discount the possibility of an interest-rate hike, he said.But some analysts are skeptical about the monetary authority’s scope to add to its December increase in borrowing costs, the first since 2011, because of political risk and a challenging export outlook in the trade-dependent economy.Exports likely fell about 4% in March from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of the official report on April 22. That would be the fourth decline in five months. — Bloomberg"

A Nintendo spokesman confirmed that Tencent had applied for the sale of Switch hardware, but could not comment specifically on the Guangdong approval, saying it was just one part of the entire process. Nintendo’s stock surged as much as 17%, the most on an intraday basis since September 2016.Tencent could prove an invaluable ally for the Kyoto-based company in China where gamers have historically shunned consoles in favor of smartphones and PCs. The alliance could provide a jolt to growth prospects for the Switch. Nintendo in January cut its outlook for the console’s shipments, raising questions about demand for the three-year-old device.“With its huge gamer population, China is like a dry sponge for Nintendo,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. “We’re now starting to see a scenario for Switch sales to continue increasing and for earnings growth.”Shares of other Japanese game publishers like Capcom Co, Square Enix Holdings Co, and Bandai Namco Holdings Inc also rose more than 3% after the news. All three release software for the Switch, raising prospects of sales on the mainland.China is the world’s largest gaming market, but consoles accounted for less than than 2% of industry revenue in 2018, researcher Newzoo estimated last year. Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. have seen limited demand since releasing their newest consoles on the mainland in 2014 and 2015, as gamers have opted to play free titles on their phones instead of spending hundreds of dollars on dedicated gaming devices.But the Tencent partnership may put Nintendo on different footing from its Western rivals, with the prospect of a strong distribution network and the marketing prowess of a household name with Chinese consumers. Nintendo’s family-friendly series like Zelda and Pokemon may also receive a warmer reception from Beijing regulators, which have hurt PlayStation and Xbox demand by not approving more-violent blockbusters like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty. — Bloomberg"

Fund managers from Amundi Asset Management to Allianz Global Investors say this is causing them to turn away from traditional bets on the dollar and euro and toward emerging markets, carry trades and taking cheap punts in options.“The cost of being wrong in options has never been lower,” said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Bank & Trust.“This really is where the current environment is interesting.”Here’s what other portfolio managers and strategists are advising for a low-volatility world:> Look at emerging marketsThe lack of big moves across developed markets means currency traders “need to venture into the darker corners of liquid emerging-market currencies,” according to Swissquote Bank SA’s head of market strategy Peter Rosenstreich.The spread between Group-of-Seven and emerging-market volatility is widening. Hedge funds have begun re-weighting emerging markets versus the dollar, according to Lyxor Asset Management’s senior cross-asset strategist Philippe Ferreira.Using the yen as a funding currency to buy the Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi or Philippine peso would have yielded significant gains, according to Societe Generale SA strategist Kit Juckes.> Bet on carryCarry also looks attractive in this environment. This strategy of betting on divergence in interest rates is doing well, with a Bloomberg index measuring carry returns from eight emerging markets funded by the dollar gaining for a third week.“I describe the current environment as everyone sitting on their hands not wanting to do too much,” said Andrew Cole, a fund manager at Pictet Asset Management. “That’s why carry trades are popular right now.”> Take some riskAn upside of the confoundingly low levels of volatility is that it’s cheaper to take risks. According to State Street’s Graf, it’s worth taking directional bets while the cost is so low. He points to dollar-yen calls as an opportunity to make some profit.Some Asian sovereign investors and large hedge funds have been using low-cost option structures such as butterflies and double no-touch trades to boost their trading revenue, according to traders in Europe, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.“Low volatility means little movement in the markets and by definition makes it more difficult to extract alpha out of FX moves,” said Andreas Koenig, head of global currencies at Amundi. “We are expressing more and more positions via options.”> New playbookTraders need to throw away the old playbook in range-trading markets, said Allianz’s Brzezniak. A low-volatility environment makes it harder to make money on trend or momentum strategies as the moves tend to be short-lived.> Nimble on poundThe pound has been trading in an even tighter range than its peers since the Brexit deadline was extended until October, with volatility slumping. The key to making profits in this environment is timing to take advantage of brief periods of volatility on headlines, said BlackRock Inc’s chief fixed-income strategist Scott Thiel.“There’s going to be volatility within a relatively narrow range, so the willingness to trade within that range can be fruitful if you get the range right,” he said. — Bloomberg"

We’re not thinking about such a thing.”Nagai, 60, this month unveiled plans to cut US$1bil of expenses from Nomura’s struggling global trading and investment banking business, a move that has already resulted in dozens of job cuts worldwide. The firm’s valuation is close to the biggest discount to global peers in two decades, as investors digest whether the restructuring plan will end years of overseas losses since it bought Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc operations in 2008.Nomura is among firms worldwide that have been battling to compete with Wall Street banks since the global financial crisis, prompting some to consider mergers as a solution. Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG are now in talks on a potential deal as the German government seeks a “national champion” for its exporters.Yet Nagai doused any speculation for a similar move in Japan, saying he’s not interested in teaming up the 94-year-old brokerage with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, the nation’s biggest bank. MUFG already has an investment-banking alliance with Morgan Stanley, and is the US firm’s largest shareholder.Nagai signalled that he may step down before the completion of the three-year overhaul as long as it goes smoothly. Two previous efforts since he became CEO in August 2012 failed to sustain an earnings recovery overseas, where Nomura has only posted an annual profit once during his reign.“I will take responsibility until things get on track,” said Nagai, who is Nomura’s longest-serving CEO in more than 30 years. He said it would be “natural” for him to leave in less than three years. Overseas operations will probably start generating annual profit if Nomura achieves 60% of its US$1bil in wholesale business cost cuts in the year ending March as planned, he said.Nomura is on course to post its first annual net loss in a decade when it reports earnings next Thursday. It lost 101.3 billion yen (US$905mil) in the nine months ended December, thanks mainly to write-downs including of its acquisition of Lehman Brothers operations in Europe and Asia.Shares of Nomura have gained 4% since the revamp was announced on April 4, and are down 31% over the past 12 months. It’s trading at 0.54 times the book value of its assets, close to the cheapest relative to global financial companies in the 20 years since Bloomberg began tracking the data.Analysts have questioned how Nomura can grow revenue after cutting front-line trading staff. Nagai is pivoting toward what he calls “client-focused” businesses, such as advisory, which tend to be less volatile. However, he suggested that it’s too early to get into details on where revenue growth will come from as the restructuring program has just started.“What we are saying is, let’s remove our old clothes and put on something that matches the new era,” he said. “What we do in our new clothes is something that we should tackle later.”Nagai isn’t entirely in retrenchment mode. He said he may look to acquire wealth management assets in Asia excluding China to make the most of the region’s growing ranks of rich people. “If there’s a good opportunity, we will naturally consider it,” he said, without elaborating on potential targets.At home, Nagai said he wants to swiftly launch the securities venture being formed with messaging platform provider Line Corp once the regulator approves it. The company filed a registration application to the Financial Services Agency in late March, he said. — Bloomberg"

This is quite scary as Malaysia has always prided itself as an economy with a current account surplus, with our value of exports well-exceeding imports being one of the country’s key strengths.“For example, in 2018, Malaysia registered a current account surplus of 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP). “Given Malaysia’s very healthy trade surplus so far, the country’s current account balance will remain in surplus for 2019,” Pua said.He said Malaysia does, however, have a moderate fiscal deficit, which is typical of developing countries, whereby for 2018, the deficit was 3.7% of GDP and is projected to fall to 3.4% this year.Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has also projected that Malaysia’s fiscal deficit would further decline to 3% for 2020 and less than 2.8% for 2021.Commenting on Tay’s claims that oil revenue made up 30% of Malaysia’s GDP, Pua said this is incorrect and Malaysia is well-recognised by the investment community as having a fairly diversified economy.Pua highlighted that Malaysia’s mining (including the oil and gas sector), manufacturing and services sectors made up 7.9%, 23% and 55.5% of the GDP in 2018, respectively. — Bernama"

The judge agreed and gave them until April 25.The two sides had reached a settlement in October that required Musk to seek approval before tweeting any information about the company that investors might view as material. However in February, Musk tweeted - without having it reviewed - that Tesla would make 500,000 cars this year, then corrected himself that that was an annualized figure. The SEC asked the court to hold him in contempt for violating their deal over the post. And at the end of a hearing earlier this month, Nathan urged both sides to “put on your reasonableness pants” and work something out.She ordered both to sit down for at least an hour and reach an agreement on how to amend their settlement, or risk her making a decision on whether to hold the billionaire CEO in contempt.Hours after news of the extension, Musk continued to tweet, making sheep jokes with the Museum of English Rural Life and changing his profile picture to a ram. Shortly afterward he posted: “My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point,” before more tweets about memes and sheep.In the run-up to the decision on the delay, Musk defended his February tweet about the car production target, saying he was just repeating information that Tesla had already disclosed. The SEC disagreed, asking Nathan to find Musk in contempt and consider hefty fines as punishment. Nathan refused to make an immediate decision, saying both sides needed to eliminate ambiguities in the earlier settlement.The fight dates back to Musk’s Aug 7 tweet that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, sending the shares surging. After an investigation, the SEC sued, saying Musk had misled investors. Musk and Tesla resolved the dispute by agreeing to each pay US$20mil, without admitting wrongdoing.Musk hasn’t let the current dispute rein in his tweeting, even while the two sides were working toward a revised deal. This past weekend, he repeated his February claim, responding to another Twitter user’s post with “Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months.” — Bloomberg"

Renault hasn’t announced a gift.Corporate and individual donations for Notre Dame have continued to pour in after a call from President Emmanuel Macron for a fund-raising campaign. Macron vowed to rebuild the 850-year-old Gothic monument, with French luxury and cosmetic billionaires and their firms quickly pledging at least €500mil.Nissan and Renault are trying to move beyond Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in a Tokyo prison on charges of financial misconduct. He has denied the allegations. Ghosn will be indicted on a fresh round of charges on April 22 as Japanese prosecutors pursue their case against the former chairman of Nissan Motor Co, broadcaster NHK reported Friday.Prosecutors will indict Ghosn as soon as Monday on new charges of aggravated breach of trust, the national broadcaster said without identifying sources. Monday is the deadline for the former auto executive’s current detention period. The charges are related to activities in the Middle East that funneled Nissan’s money for Ghosn’s personal gain, NHK said.Ghosn, who was arrested for the first time in November, is being held in a Tokyo jail. The former auto executive briefly won his freedom on bail in March, but was arrested and jailed again on new allegations of sending million of dollars from Nissan money to accounts he controlled. A new indictment will keep Ghosn detained for longer.The former chairman of Nissan and alliance partners Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp has denied the allegations as well as previously filed charges accusing him of falsifying financial information and breach of trust. Another lengthy stay in prison, with limited access to his lawyers, could make it harder for Ghosn to prepare for a trial that may start later this year or next year. Ghosn’s legal woes - beginning with his arrest in November - threw the companies’ decades-old alliance into disarray and exposed a climate of deep suspicion at the top echelons of government and management.Months before Ghosn’s arrest, his push to solidify the alliance on the impetus of France raised fears in Japan that it would boost the influence of the French state, Renault’s most powerful shareholder, at Nissan’s expense. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/eye-on-stock--genting-malaysia/,Eye On Stock - Genting Malaysia,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"GENTING Malaysia Bhd  (code: 4715) appeared to be initiating a rebound in Friday trading as it turned higher to cross the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) on bullish momentum.
Breaking free of the moving average at RM3.15 in intra-day trade, the counter appears to be regaining some strength after retreating from the RM3.47 resistance on March 18. Based on the daily price chart, the share price is moving below the key SMA lines, which suggests a bearish outlook. 
The 14- and 21-day SMAs remain at descending angles, which signals the immediate downtrend remains intact. However, another session of buying would likely turn the short-term moving averages towards a bullish posture. Should the rebound take root, the stock could be aiming higher for a positive crossing with the 50-day SMA at RM3.28, which would indicate a return to positive sentiment. There is optimism that the share price is angling for yet another challenge to the RM3.47 mark, having been turned back twice in recent months.

A breach of the resistance would see the share price return to November 2018 levels, prior to a heavy sell-off on news that Twentieth Century Fox was pulling out of the Genting theme park agreement. The RM3.47 mark represents the upper limit of the trading gap left behind during the sell-off.
The momentum indicators show a strong return from oversold levels following Friday’s share price advance.
The slow-stochastic momentum index reached 50 points touching the mid-line, which indicates growing momentum. The 14-day relative strength index also rose out of oversold conditions and stopped at 64 points, in a strong push towards the higher end of the neutral zone.
Meanwhile, the daily moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) line stopped right on the signal line, falling short of a positive crossing and giving a “buy” signal. A further session of gains will confirm the crossing, signaling a growing uptrend as the MACD line rises towards the zero line.
The share price continues to see support at the RM3.05 mark. A crossing below that mark would see it descend towards December 2018 levels at RM2.86 or lower at RM2.70.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/lack-of-investor-confidence-hits-bursa/,Lack of investor confidence hits Bursa,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"REVIEW: A lack of confidence in the domestic market and a potential downgrade in sovereign bonds emerged as the catalyst to push the FBM KLCI towards 2016 lows.
Confidence in local government bonds came under the spotlight on Monday following FTSE Russell’s statement that it had reviewed Malaysia’s debt and was considering removing it from the World Government Bond Index after six months on a watch list.
This came as a second blow to Malaysian bonds as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund had announced a cutting back in emerging market bonds on April 5.
Should Malaysia be excluded from the global index, Morgan Stanley estimated that total bond outflows could reach US$8bil (RM33bil) based on its 0.39% weighting and the estimated US$2tril tracking the index.
“Risk of being pulled out will depend much on our macro fundamentals and also on our market accessibility,” said Ambank Research on Wednesday.
The sell-off in the local currency was swift and the ringgit slid 0.6% on Tuesday. The decline continued over subsequent sessions, with the currency ending 0.5% lower against the greenback over the week at 4.133, which was a return to January levels.

The equity market, already lagging behind regional peers and the worst-performing among major markets in 2019 year-to-date, was jolted by the negative news.
The negative momentum accelerated, pushing the index further below a short-term descending trendline and towards its next support of 1,609 points.
More positive external factors seemed to have taken a back seat in light of the potential impact on the local market.
While Wall Street’s corporate earnings season had put in a mixed-bag of results, global  markets were generally heartened by the prospects of the US-China trade war nearing an end.
Asian markets were mostly higher over the week as trade fears receded following comments by Washington that both parties would be subject to enforcement mechanisms, suggesting concessions were being made.
Bloomberg cites sources as saying the negotiators are aiming for a late-May signing of a trade agreement.
Meanwhile, another boon to investor sentiment came with the influx of Chinese data that showed better-than-expected growth, suggesting that Beijing’s stimulus measures may have mitigated the slowdown.
Chinese GDP and trade data that were released on Wednesday beat expectations, giving Asian indices a mid-week boost that offset profit-taking. 
While gains were capped by the uncertainty of Wall Street earnings, by and large, the results came in better than expected and the US’s major indices posted weekly gains.
Of course, Malaysia’s stock market was left in the lurch during this course of events. 
While the FBM KLCI continued to move in consolidation mode over Monday and Tuesday, the heavy selldown came on Wednesday.
Losing 8.56 points in midweek, the local index saw its most heavily weighted counter Maybank falling 21 sen  to RM9.  The overall market took a broad-based retreat  with decliners overwhelming advancers three to one. 
The bloodshed continued on Thursday with the index losing as much as 11 points to the supporting low of 1,609 before a rebound in the afternoon helped pare losses to 1.17 points to 1,619.73.
Bursa Malaysia remained opened on Good Friday and the index rebounded 2.34 points to close the week at 1,622.07.
Offshore funds accelerated their disposal of local equity, turning net sellers every day of the week for a combined net disposal of RM373.6mil over four sessions to Thursday.
Statistics: The major index ended the week 8.1 points or 0.5% lower over the previous week, at 1,622.07. 
Total turnover for the trading week stood at 14.13 billion shares amounting to RM9.25bil compared with 17.52 billion shares worth RM11.47bil over the previous week.
Outlook: The FBM KLCI made a rebound on Friday after a dismal week that saw the index testing the 1,609 resistance, effectively putting it at 2016 lows. The positive retracement on Thursday afternoon to end the session at a slight loss after having shaved off 11 points in the morning session, however, suggested the index was ready for some recovery.
Indeed, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) showed a return from oversold conditions. By Friday, the slow-stochastic had joined the RSI in issuing a bullish signal when the percent K oscillator crossed the percent D oscillator.
It will be a difficult recovery for the index as the 1,626 support has turned resistance  and short-term 14- and 21-day simple moving averages (SMA) continue to descend, indicating downwards pressure.
The short-term descending trendline that starts from Feb 22 remains intact and current meets the 21-day SMA.
Moving forward, a return above the 21-day SMA to the round figure of 1,640 would suggest the rebound has grown in momentum while the round figure of 1,660 has emerged as a possible target for a near-term rally.
However, further negative catalysts could see the index return to the 1,609 support, a stiff support that looks unlikely to be breached at the present time."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/for-private-equity-japan-still-beats-china/,"For private equity, Japan still beats China",Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"Japan lost its position as the world’s second-biggest economy to China awhile ago. But it’s beating out its Asian rival in one area at least: private equity. For restructuring experts such as KKR & Co. LP, whose founders recently declared Japan the company’s “highest priority” outside the US, the smaller country offers much more attractive opportunities. And the reasons are as much political as financial. That might seem surprising, given that the Chinese market dwarfs Japan’s. (Private equity investment value in greater China, including domestic yuan funds, averaged US$72bil annually in the past five years, compared to just US$9bil in Japan.) The mainland features growth companies galore and easy exit opportunities through initial public offerings in Hong Kong, the US and soon, for tech firms, Shanghai.Private-equity companies from around the world have raised billions of dollars to invest in China, hoping to take advantage of its domestic consumption story and tech frenzy. KKR has bought into Chinese firms such as pork producer Cofco Meat Holdings Ltd. and personal-finance platform Shenzhen Suishou Technology Co. Ltd.Yet several factors undercut China’s attractiveness. Typically, for instance, most targets aren’t as mature as those in Japan or the US; they’re still in empire-building mode, so only minority stakes are available for purchase. Deals are in the range of a few hundred million dollars on average -- small potatoes compared to Bain’s US$18bil purchase a couple years of ago of Toshiba Corp’s memory chip business. Valuations, too, are frothy. By contrast, as in the US, Japan’s dying conglomerates offer rich pickings. They house a slew of under-loved or non-core assets: About a quarter of the companies on the Nikkei 400 have 100 or more subsidiaries apiece, and many have more than 300 divisions below the parent company.There’s a real chance to create global leaders from these assets -- an opportunity that China’s domestic-focused private equity investors don’t enjoy. KKR, which has been in Japan since 2010 and invested in six deals since then, has put this strategy to work with the healthcare business of Panasonic Corp, which it acquired in 2013. Since renamed PHC, the unit bought  Bayer AG’s diabetes care unit and is in the midst of acquiring Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.’s pathology business. In 2016, KKR also bought auto-parts maker Calsonic Kansei Corp from Nissan for US$4.3bil. The takeover target has since announced plans to buy Fiat Chrysler’s high-tech parts-making business. Equally important is the fact that the Japanese government now actively supports such buyouts, a big change from the insular boom years when private equity firms were decried as rapacious foreign raiders. There was remarkably little public backlash after Toshiba sold off its crown jewel, or when Nissan sold Calsonic. At least in part, that’s because Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a greater focus on corporate governance and shareholder returns. That means slimming down unwieldy conglomerates and revamping management at under-performing companies. Foreign private equity firms can help do both, and then get these essentially mature businesses to expand globally. They can address another problem as well: Thousands of Japanese family-owned firms are facing potential succession crises as founders near retirement. That’s much less of a problem in China, where companies are newer. Investors clearly see opportunity. A study by Bain & Company found that private equity firms in Japan are willing to pay 9.7 times Ebitda in the form of enterprise value for their targets, while corporate acquirers and the stock market pay almost 25 percent less.No one’s giving up on China; indeed, KKR’s own former China heads recently raised an eye-catching $2 billion for a debut private equity fund focused on the mainland. Yet, around the world, billions of dollars have been raised but  not spent for lack of targets. That money might find a comfortable home in Japan. - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/pinterest-zoom-debuts-set-pace-for-unicorns-ipo-derby/,"Pinterest, Zoom debuts set pace for unicorns’ IPO derby",Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"SAN FRANCISCO: Pinterest Inc and Zoom Video Communications Inc. hit the public markets in soaring debuts, setting the pace for other so-called unicorns racing toward initial public offerings.Zoom’s dizzying ascent -- its shares rose as much as 83% before closing up 72% -- left founder and chief executive officer Eric Yuan lamenting the high price and the pressure it puts on the company. That concern arose despite Yuan becoming a billionaire three times over as the video-conferencing company soared to a value of US$15.9bil after its US$751mil IPO. Just two years ago, Zoom was valued at only US$1bil in a private funding round.“The price is too high,’’ Eric Yuan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Today, wow, there’s a big pop. It is out of our control.’’Pinterest, the digital-scrapbooking site whose advertisers seek to reach purchase-minded consumers, raised US$1.4bil in its IPO, second only to Lyft Inc for US IPOs this year. Along with Texas oil explorer Brigham Minerals Inc’s US$261 million listing and offerings by two smaller companies, Wednesday was the biggest day of the year for IPOs, with more than US$2.7bil in new shares sold.Like Zoom, Pinterest priced its shares above its marketed range and began trading on Thursday, closing its first day up 28%. Brigham Minerals trailed those two with a merely solid 11% gain for the day.The strong showing by Pinterest and Zoom signals continuing investor thirst for new stocks amid a surge of unicorns – startups valued at US$1bil or more – going public. Other high-profile companies with plans to go public or considering it include Uber Technologies Inc, Slack Technologies Inc, Postmates Inc, Palantir Technologies Inc and Airbnb Inc.Ride-hailing global behemoth Uber is preparing what will likely be the year’s biggest IPO in the US. It will seek to raise about US$10bil in May in a listing valuing it at about US$100bil, people familiar with its plans have said.“Today’s opening pop in the shares of Zoom and Pinterest suggests that investors are not looking at ‘risky’ unicorns as a group, but instead are valuing each company on their merits,” Alejandro Ortiz, principal analyst at SharesPost Inc, said in a emailed statement.Fears that Lyft’s sagging stock – it’s fallen 19% from its US$72 IPO price – would bode poorly for other unicorns appear to have been overblown, Ortiz said.At its highest price on Thursday, Zoom briefly overtook the market valuation of Lyft, which ended on Thursday at US$16.7bil. The jump Zoom’s shares put its valuation above that of Pinterest, with US$12.9bil, and Tradeweb Markets Inc, which raised US$1.1bil in the third-biggest US listing this year and is now valued at about US$8.7bil.Whether Zoom and Pinterest can hold on to their debut gains will be determined beginning Monday, when the market reopens after the Good Friday holiday and the weekend.Unlike most of tech unicorns that have gone public or plan to this year, Zoom has made a profit. It reported net income of US$7.6mil for the year ended January on revenue of US$331mil, compared with a loss of US$3.8mil a year earlier on revenue of US$151mil.Zoom’s financials are “one of the most impressive’’ ever seen by D.A. Davidson in an IPO filing, analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote in a note to clients in March. He said at the time that he wouldn’t be surprised if it reached a valuation of US$10bil to US$15bil on its first day as a public company.Yuan, Zoom’s CEO, said that he thinks that the San Jose, California-based company can live up to the hype.“The market opportunity is huge, over US$40bil,’’ Yuan said. “As long as we stay humble, continue working as hard as we can to keep delivering happiness to our customers, I think it will be OK in the long run.’’Pinterest said in its IPO filing that it now reaches more than 250 million monthly active users globally. The company had about US$756mil in revenue from online advertisements in 2018, a 60% growth rate that accelerated from the previous year. Its net loss shrunk to US$63mil in 2018 from US$130mil in 2017.Pinterest has a key advantage in competing for advertising dollars, chief executive officer Ben Silbermann said on Thursday in an interview. Unlike other sites, Pinterest users typically are looking to eventually buy what they are searching for, which lines up with what advertisers want, he said.Most of its user growth, though, is coming from international markets, where the average revenue per user is much lower than in the US. In 2018, more than 80 % of new users were from outside the US. however, they generated about 25 US cents per person compared with US$9.04 for those based in the US.“We’re going to continue to invest for the long term,” he said. “We’ve shown really good margin improvement over the last few years. My eye is always on what’s going to make Pinterest great three years, five years, 10 years from now. “That’s going to be how we continue to run the business.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/mukesh-ambanis-bet-on-indias-middleclass-pays-off/,Mukesh Ambani’s bet on India’s middle-class pays off,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"MUMBAI: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s debt-fuelled bet on the rise of the Indian consumer is starting to pay off, with his retail and telecommunications businesses contributing an increasing share of revenue and profit to his US$87bil empire.The two divisions accounted for a combined 23% of revenue for the year ended March, up from 17% in the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That growth has come at the expense of the conglomerate’s energy-related arms, which have been the bedrock of Ambani’s business for more than a decade.Their revenue share dropped to 77%t from 83%, the data show. Asia’s richest man has ambitions to take on Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc in India, where the power of the middle class is growing along with demand for e-commerce. Ambani launched the telecommunications business in 2016, spending US$36bil to roll out a 4G wireless network across India and luring millions of subscribers with free or cut-price data services. He’s now building on that business to create an online shopping platform, just as the US giants come up against constraints on foreign e-commerce activity in India.Ambani has set big expectations for Reliance’s consumer divisions, saying they will contribute almost as much to the conglomerate’s earnings as energy-related arms by the end of 2028.The push into e-commerce shows how the billionaire is trying to put his mark on an empire that he largely inherited. Ambani, whose father Dhirubhai founded Reliance in 1959, agreed to split the businesses with his brother Anil three years after their father died without leaving a will. Mukesh got control of the flagship oil refining and petrochemicals arms.Anil got Reliance’s newer services businesses in the split, including telecommunications. His brother’s entry into the industry and resulting price war has hit many rivals – including Anil’s Reliance Communications Ltd – undercutting market leaders Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd in a price war. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Mukesh’s telecom unit, saw profit in the year quadruple to 29.6 billion rupees (US$427mil), the company said on Thursday.But he’s racked up borrowing to finance that push, with Reliance Industries’ net debt climbing to 1.93 trillion rupees in the year ended March, or about 2.3 times ebitda, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 2.69 times average for companies on the S&P BSE Sensex index as of Dec. 31.In his quest to build a competitive e-commerce platform, Mukesh Ambani, 62, has been acquiring or purchasing stakes in businesses from Radisys Corp to Vakt Holdings Ltd in a series of deals worth US$2.5bil over the past two years. Reliance, Amazon and Walmart’s Bangalore-based Flipkart Online Services Pvt are seeking to carve up an online shopping market that Morgan Stanley estimates will grow to US$200bil by 2028, from about US$30bil last year.Ambani may be looking to raise more cash to fund his expansion plans, which include a proposal to add capacity to Reliance Industries’ oil refining operations.He’s considering selling 25% of the conglomerate’s refinery business to investors including state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co in a deal that could fetch at least US$10bil, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg earlier this week. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/do-you-earn-enough-to-sustain-your-lifestyle/,Do you earn enough to sustain your lifestyle?,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"DO you know how much you need to sustain your lifestyle every month? Are you living within your budget or stretching to make ends meet?We can now gain insights with the unveiling of Belanjawanku, an Expenditure Guide for Malaysian Individuals and Families, launched by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in early March.The guide offers an idea of the living costs for respective household categories. It encompasses the expenditure on basic needs and involvement in society for a reasonable standard of living in the Klang Valley. According to Belanjawanku, a married couple with two children spend about RM6,620 per month on food, transport, housing, childcare, utilities, healthcare, personal care, annual expenses, savings, social participation and discretionary expenses. When I read this guide together with the income statistics published by the Statistics Department, it reveals that a vast majority of Malaysians can’t afford to live in the Klang Valley. Based on the statistics, the median household income for Malaysian households in 2016 is RM5,228, far below the RM6,620 required for a family with two children to stay in the Klang Valley. If we take a closer look, the median income of M40 group (Middle 40%) is RM6,275, which means five out of 10 households in this category received RM6,275 per month or less. This indicates that over 60% (40% from B40 households and half of the M40 households) of Malaysian households (if they have two children) can’t afford to stay in the Klang Valley. What went wrong in the process? Why are many households having challenges to meet the required budget?According to Belanjawanku, a married couple with two children spent the majority of their income on food (RM1,550), followed by childcare (RM1,150) and transport (RM1,040), then only on housing (RM870) and other items. Based on the research, even if housing was provided for free, a household of four would still need RM5,750 to sustain their lifestyle. Therefore, the common perception that only housing is expensive is not right. It is not that housing is expensive, but that everything is expensive because of inflation over the years! The value of our currency has fallen due to global money printing measures over the past decade. Belanjawanku compiles only core living expenses without luxury items or excessive spending. It also doesn’t include long-term financial planning tools such as funds for education or investments. If the majority of Malaysian households have challenges in meeting the existing expenses listed in the guide, it poses a serious concern on their future financial prospects. The underlying factor of this challenge is the low household income earned by Malaysians. The previous government failed to move us to a high income nation as they had promised, and more families are stretching to make ends meet now. It may lead to serious financial problems in the future. If median household incomes don’t increase, the B40 (Bottom 40%) and half of the M40 will always struggle even if housing is free, assuming that they aspire to have two children and to live in the Klang Valley. According to Transparency International Malaysia, corruption had cost our country about 4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) value each year since 2013. Added together, this amounts to a high figure of some RM212.3bil since 2013. For 2017 alone, that figure was a whopping RM46.9bil!Imagine what we can do with these monies if there was no leakage in the system? The previous government should have channeled the money to stimulate economic growth and increase the income of the rakyat. Going forward, I am optimistic that the new government, with its promise of a clean and transparent government, can finally fix the leakage and focus on generating a higher income level for all Malaysian households. Financial independence is a key factor in the overall well being of the rakyat. We need to increase household incomes to a level where families can meet their basic needs and embark on long-term financial planning, to elevate their quality of life. Then, and only then, will housing and other living expenses finally become affordable.Datuk Alan Tong has over 50 years of experience in property development.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/20/pockets-of-opportunities/,Pockets of opportunities,Business News,"Saturday, 20 Apr 2019",,"AMID the current property backdrop, a common phrase among optimists is that the lacklustre market offers “pockets of opportunities”. But does that adage hold true?For most developers, the current property market slowdown has forced them to pull back or postpone their launches.And for those not looking to rest on their laurels, it’s a time to tweak the various marketing strategies, push boundaries and find or make new ways to push sales.“It’s time to get creative,” says an industry observer, who adds that the current six-month Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) 2019 is a “saving grace” for Malaysian property developers.“The campaign sees developers offering all kinds of discounts and goodies to attract buyers. Everyone is in on it and competing with each other and trying to outdo each other. This is a great time to buy property – so long as you have the means,” he says.At the 11th Malaysian Property Summit (MPS) 2019 earlier this year, Rahim & Co International Sdn Bhd research director Sulaiman Akhmady Mohd Saheh said while the number of launches and sales performance by developers have been declining, there are projects that are still performing well.“This is due to product, concept, location, access and marketing strategies,” he says.Some developers that have been leveraging on the HOC have been reporting good responses for their products.In conjunction with the HOC, which kicked off in January, Sime Darby Property Bhd chief marketing and sales officer Gerard Yuen says the company recently kicked off a campaign which is launching eight projects in eight weeks.Comprising 1,200 units worth RM817mil, he says two of the projects launched have already been fully taken up.Meanwhile, Valuation and Property Services Department director-general Ahmad Zailan Azizuddin says the property market is expected to stabilise this year.“Unsold and overhang of properties have become hot issues and the government has taken steps to overcome them, such as the HOC.“The overhang status needs attention and the government incentives help to sustain the property market,” he says in a presentation at MPS 2019.Meanwhile, Knight Frank Malaysia valuation and advisory executive director Keith Ooi says that unlike the conventional assets, healthcare and institutional real estate are alternative specialised asset classes that is less reliant on the economy. “From the investors’ point of view, this specialised asset class is attractive as it provides certainty, by offering long-term leases with step-up rental,” he says in a statement.Citing Knight Frank’s Malaysia Commercial Real Estate Investment Sentiment Survey 2019, he says some respondents lamented the increased challenges in raising funds for commercial real estate, particularly the conventional assets.“The healthcare and institutional assets will be somewhat insulated from this challenge as respondents among the lenders and fund/real estate investment trusts managers indicate that they may increase their exposure in the sub-sector in 2019.“The healthcare and institutional sub-sector is truly a hidden gem as investors become more familiar with this asset class. I foresee there will be more real estate transactions in this sub-sector in 2019,” says Ooi.Knight Frank Malaysia capital markets executive director James Buckley says in the same statement that market activities, especially in retail and office sub-sectors, had certainly slowed down in 2018.“Investors have become increasingly cautious given the extent of the forthcoming new supply, decreasing occupancy and declining rentals. In 2019, we have already observed a rise in the number of owners wanting to sell their commercial property assets, but the bid-ask spread will need to narrow before we see more transactions successfully completing.“Commercial properties in Malaysia do provide good yields relative to other markets in Asia Pacific, but higher relative borrowing costs, generally exceeding 5%, has lowered the cash-on-cash yield.”He says this has reduced the attractiveness of Malaysia’s property market in the eyes of international investors who compare the returns they can achieve elsewhere in the region.“Owners need to become more realistic about their price expectations given the market situation. Investing in the healthcare and institutional assets, such as education, is still a fairly new trend in Malaysia.”However, Buckley adds that it is possible that more deals will come to fruition from this sub-sector, with investors being attracted by its defensive qualities as it is less reliant on the general state of the economy, offers long leases and often comes with fixed increases in rent throughout the duration of the lease.“The logistics and industrial sub-sector have in the past been the poor relation to offices and retail malls, but investors are increasingly seeing the benefits. It offers higher yields, often with great covenants and the construction is simple and fast. “The rising demand for good quality warehousing and distribution hubs and an undersupply bodes well for future rental growth.”In general, while the commercial real estate market remains challenging, Buckley says this also presents a good opportunity for well-capitalised key players to acquire suitable assets at reasonable prices.”Retail evolutionOn the retail front, it has been forecast that some 40 malls are slated to enter Greater Kuala Lumpur by 2020. There are already about 250 malls in the Klang Valley currently.With competition intensifying among bricks-and-mortar malls and online retail creating a structural shift both locally and globally, many shopping complexes (not all) are fighting to remain competitive.The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) in its research note “The Halo Effect – How Bricks Impact Clicks,” says an important “must-do” for retailers is to compete with consumers’ shrinking attention spans.The report, citing Green Street Advisors retail lead analyst DJ Busch, acknowledges that retailers are already taking a number of steps to enhance the in-store experience, so customers show up and stick around.“Landlords are making investments in food and beverage offerings. Retailers are also ensuring they have the right merchandise mix to cater to today’s well-informed consumers. Busch sees pragmatic reasons for investing in physical stores.“For one, digitally native retailers are discovering that they can operate more efficiently by being closer to their customers. The acquisition cost of customers by having a physical location is much lower and more efficient than online.”The report adds that personalisation should be another data-driven area of focus.“One tactic includes loyalty programs that capture individual shoppers’ preferences across multiple points of sale. Based on that intelligence, retailers can target consumers’ desire for customisation, down to the color, design, or monogram.”Seamless shopping, or in other words, ‘convenience,’ is also another important element for retailers, says ICSC.“As traditional retailers work to erase walls between offline and online shopping and digitally native brands explore physical channels, the ultimate goal is a seamless experience in which barriers between consumers and products continue to come down.“Consumers expect the store experience to become more frictionless, from the ease of checkout, leveraging technological advances such as being able to buy online and pick up in the stores, buying in-store with their own devices, or as we get further and further down the line, to walk into a store and grab and go.”ICSC says points to Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market in 2017 as a prominent example of the surge in seamless shopping.“Amazon’s investment in physical stores demonstrates its commitment to omni-channel shopping, even as retailers decide on the right format, store size, and product mix to keep customers engaged.“The expectations of the store are higher. Sometimes shoppers may want a purchase delivered to their home. Sometimes they’re going to pick it up. Sometimes that means they’re going to shop in your store. You have to meet the consumer where and when they want.”In its latest retail industry report, Retail Group Malaysia (RGM) says it expects a 4.5% growth in retail sales to RM108.30bil in 2019 for the local market.For the first quarter, it expects the retail industry to recover and expand by 3.1%, with pharmacy and personal care expanding the fastest by 12.7%, followed by department stores at 7.6%.RGM says the overall retail industry is expected to recover and grow at an estimated 4.8%, underpinned by the Hari Raya festival taking place during this period.During the third quarter of this year, retail sales are expected to expand by 3.9%. More activities during the second half of this year should boost retail sales during the final quarter of this year. During the year-end period, retail sales should rise by 5.8%,” it says.ICSC meanwhile believes that a bright future lies ahead for physical retail stores.“When retailers invest in brick-and-mortar locations, their online presence thrives. What’s more, retailers with physical stores perform better on measures of brand awareness and consumer perceptions than in markets where those brands lack physical locations.“As the findings, examples, and insights in this report reveal, physical stores matter, but retailers must continue to innovate in order to flourish in today’s environment.”The report cautioned however that just because physical stores remain relevant, that does not mean that they can “coast on past successes.”“Consumers are fickle, customer expectations continue to rise, and new brands and products continue to change the trajectory of retail. As the analysts in this report suggest, integrating digital and physical experiences will inspire shoppers.“Today’s digitally empowered consumers may enjoy an increasing array of methods to buy what they need, but physical stores remain the dominant channel for building, growing, and sustaining brands.”"

The tile manufacturer, one of the most active counters, fell 4.48%, or 1.5 sen to 32 sen with over 27.19 million shares done at midday. The counter fell to a low of 28 sen earlier. Year-to-date, it has gained some 65%.

Earlier, Seacera has warned that it is potentially headed towards a default on its payment obligations in the highly likely event that it will not be able to proceed with its settlement proposals in time.

However, Datuk William Tan Wei Lian, the single largest shareholder of Seacera with a 16.4% stake, has pledged to inject RM30mil, or more into the company to resolve its cash flow and credit liability, if need be.

Tan pledged was in response to Seacera management’s earlier announcement on the necessity to carry out two proposals to avoid “a grave financial condition.” 

The proposals are the settlement of RM31.31mil that the group owes to creditors by issuing 149.09 million new Seacera shares and a private placement of up to 126.34 million new Seacera shares, representing about 30 per cent of Seacera’s existing issued share capital.  

Tan refuted the need to carry out the proposals, saying the company had net assets totalling about RM838mil and 501-acre land free from encumbrances with a book value of about RM784mil.

“Seacera’s receivables amounts to approximately RM90mil. In addition, the company raised approximately RM15mil from the issuance of the employee share option scheme (ESOS) within February and March this year,” he added. 

Tan had called for the EGM to be held on May 15, 2019 to appoint six new directors and to remove eight existing directors of the company."

At 9.06 am, the local unit was traded at 4.1380/1430 against the greenback from 4.1400/1450 at yesterday's close.

A dealer said buying demand for the ringgit increased as oil futures edged up, with Brent crude futures settled up 35 cents to US$71.97 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 24 cents to US$64.00 a barrel.

“This is perceived to be good for the country's oil and gas revenue.

""Furthermore, the ringgit was also higher due to bargain hunting activities, after it closed at a nearly three-month low against the US dollar on Wednesday following the possible downgrade of Malaysian bonds by the global index provider, FTSE Russell,” he said.

However, he said some investors were confident that the government would not let the potential downgrade by FTSE Russell and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's pullout from Malaysia's government bonds affect the country's economic growth.

Meanwhile, the ringgit also traded higher against other major currencies.

It rose against the Singapore dollar to 3.0525/0567 from 3.0535/0584 at the close yesterday and was higher against the Japanese yen at 3.6963/7011 from 3.6991/6039.

Stephen Innes, managing partner and head of trading at SPI Asset Management says the ringgit is ailing from the knock-on effect of the Norway sovereign wealth fund trimming emerging market debt and the FTSE Russell exclusion announcement.

However, Innes believes it is unlikely for one of the big three rating agencies to follow suit, which is a silver lining for the currency.

""Indeed there's blood on the street, but these levels should look attractive with China credit expansion underway, infrastructure spending picking up and of course the US-China trade deal potentially getting tabled as early as May,"" he added."

Over the past decade, liquidity has risen before results, then dropped on the day itself as volatility increases and quants stay away, according to calculations from the U.S. bank. In other words, volumes were spurred by anticipation of corporate reports, and volatility fanned by reaction to them.

“The five days preceding the earnings day offer the most attractive days to access liquidity in a single stock,” Goldman strategists led by John Marshall wrote in a note. “Pre-position for earnings moves, but wait until four to six days after to exit.”

The study comes as Goldman has seen an improvement in broad liquidity metrics over the last three months after declines to multi-year lows at the end of 2018. In a research note in December, strategists led by Marshall and Rocky Fishman said the divergence between 2018’s heightened equity volatility and relative economic stability can be explained in large part by illiquidity.

It’s a fear often expressed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which restated this month that liquidity and volatility can be connected in a feedback loop that exaggerates price moves.

Marshall’s April note also offered 25 “most differentiated” ideas for the next three months of earnings, where Goldman’s analysts are most out of consensus for the coming quarter and expect shares to move. 

Firms such as Amazon.com Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Amgen Inc. and Marriott International Inc. make the list of those with upside to estimates, while Gap Inc. and Intel Corp. are among those with the most downside.

Also, the consumer discretionary sector provides “unusually strong alpha opportunities,” or chances to beat the overall market, because its earnings-day moves have increased recently, the strategists said.

Another big opportunity may lie in the options market, especially given low volatility levels on broad cross-asset metrics. An index of currency volatility is at is lowest since 2014 and a gauge of Treasury price swings fell to a record low last month. The VIX closed Thursday at 12.09, near its lowest in six months.

“The average implied earnings day move ahead of this earnings season is +/-4.1 percent, its lowest level on record,” the strategists wrote. “We see options as unusually attractive given the recent rise in earnings-day volatility. We see low implied moves as evidence that there is limited fear priced into stocks.” - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/19/nissan-plans-global-output-cut-of-about-15pct/,Nissan plans global output cut of about 15%,Auto,"Friday, 19 Apr 2019",11:15 AM MYT,"TOKYO: Nissan Motor Co. is planning to cut global output by around 15 percent for the fiscal year to March 2020, the Nikkei reported, citing unnamed sources.

Japan’s third-largest automaker is moving away from an aggressive expansion campaign encouraged by ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn, and seeking to produce around 4.6 million units, according to the newspaper. The output level, which is being communicated to suppliers, would be the lowest in nine years, the report said.

Nicholas Maxfield, a spokesman for Yokohama-based Nissan, declined to comment on what he called “speculative media reports.” Nissan shares slipped as much as 1.6 percent in early morning trade in Tokyo. The stock is up 7.7 percent this year, following a 22 percent decline in 2018. 

Ghosn, who was arrested for the first time in November, is being detained in a Tokyo jail on allegations of misusing Nissan’s money for personal gain. He has denied the allegations as well as formal charges accusing him of falsifying financial information and breach of trust.

Toshihide Kinoshita, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., wrote in a report that the figures, though unverified, suggest production levels well below his projections, and that the negative impact on annual operating profit could be 150 billion to 200 billion yen ($1.3 billion-$1.8 billion), although that doesn’t take into account any efforts by Nissan to cut costs or reduce inventory.

In February, Nissan slashed its operating profit forecast to 450 billion yen, to well below analysts’ estimates as sales in China and the U.S. sputter. 

Nissan will probably report earnings results on May 14, giving investors a look into its performance as the entire industry faces complex issues such as the U.K.’s potentially jarring exit from the European Union and huge investments in electric and autonomous vehicles.

Nissan is cutting a future target for China car sales by about 8 percent, people familiar with the matter said in March. Output in Japan will remain basically unchanged at more than 900,000 units, while overseas production will fall by 20 percent to around 3.7 million vehicles, the Nikkei reported.

The move may impact earnings and throw a shadow over Nissan’s alliance with Renault SA, the newspaper said. - Bloomberg"

Maybank Investment Bank Research said on Friday weak market conditions and multiple concerns had caused MAHB’s share price to fall 19% year-to-date.

“The stock could drop off as a KLCI constituent if its ranking slips further to no. 36 (or below). 

“Replacing it could be Westports, F&N or YTL Corp. MAHB is a buy in our coverage list; Westports (TP: RM3.65) is a Hold: F&N and YTL Corp are not rated,” it said. 

The research house said the KLCI constituents are due for a review, using share prices as at market close on May 27. 

The constituent change/s will be implemented after the market closes on the third Friday in June which is June 21 and would take effect on Monday, June 24.
 
Maybank Research said based on share prices on Thursday's market close, MAHB has fallen in rank in full market capitalisation, to 34; its ranking was 35 for the most part of this week and last. 

If MAHB's market rank slips to, or falls below 36 on May 27, the stock could exit as a  KLCI constituent, to be replaced by the highest rank non-existing constituent.

The potentials are Westports (30 based on Thursday), F&N (31) and YTL Corp (32). 

While KLCCP (Hold, TP RM7.85) had exited in the Nov 2018 review, it ranked higher at  28 on Thursday), it has yet to meet the liquidity test to be restored as a constituent, we estimate. 

“There is still another one month plus to go before the actual constituent review, and the market capitalisation ranking could continue to change,” Maybank Research said."

China Minsheng Investment Group Corp. has appointed Kirkland & Ellis as legal adviser, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing, which also noted that banks have set up a creditor’s committee to try to stabiliSe the company.
 
The cross default comes after CMIG’s problems spread to its affiliate Yida China Holdings Ltd., making some of the developer’s debt immediately payable, and causing a chain reaction back to the parent company’s own securities.

CMIG spooked investors with a late bond repayment earlier this year, joining other sprawling Chinese conglomerates such as HNA Group Co. in struggling to repay debt after a spending spree. 

Since its establishment in 2014, CMIG has spent more than $4 billion on investments and amassed about $35 billion of liabilities as of September.

“CMIG’s debt crisis will worsen as creditors will seek to freeze more assets if it defaults on onshore publicly offered notes,” said Chen Su, a bond portfolio manager at Qingdao Rural Commercial Bank Co. The problems won’t be resolved unless CMIG finds more willing investors, he said.

CMIG’s dollar bonds due in August traded at around 40 cents on the dollar Thursday, according to traders.

CMIG said in the filing Thursday that it has also reached an agreement with holders of a privately placed note to extend the payment date to April 19 from April 8.

Yida China’s credit rating was cut to CCC from CCC+ at S&amp;P Global Ratings late Thursday, which said the company may face a liquidity crunch in the next 12 months, given the overhang of debt repayable on demand.

Signs of corporate stress appear to be spreading, despite China’s stabilizing economy. Citic Guoan Group Co., a state-linked conglomerate, was downgraded on Wednesday after fresh asset seizures, helping trigger a plunge in its listed unit’s shares. 

Tewoo Group earlier this month sought support from lenders to extend its debt amid a credit squeeze. Bonds from at least 44 Chinese companies totaling $43.7 billion face repayment pressure, according to company and ratings firm statements compiled by Bloomberg.

Market Impact

CMIG’s defaults may harm investor sentiment toward future offerings from privately-held and unrated issuers, according to Patrick Liu, chief executive officer of Admiralty Harbour Capital Ltd., a Hong Kong-based debt specialist firm. 

Still, given the relatively small amount of CMIG’s outstanding dollar bonds, with some backed by letters of credit, there will be limited impact on the offshore market, he said.

CMIG is the brainchild of Dong Wenbiao, the former chairman of China’s largest non-state bank who’s known as the “godfather’’ of the nation’s private sector. 


Billing the company as a Chinese version of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Dong convinced 59 non-state companies to join forces as the company’s founding shareholders. 

The company’s funding eventually dried up as its investments struggled and shadow banks pulled back because of tighter regulation and slowing economic growth.

“Solving CMIG’s debt problem will hinge on its onshore creditor committee, and this may not be fully addressed soon,” said Shen Chen, a partner at Shanghai Maoliang Investment Management. 

There appears to be little synergy between the company’s various holdings, and finding investors willing to pay for its assets at a good price while taking on a huge debt load will be challenging, Shen said. - Bloomberg"

Pua issued a statement on Friday in response to a Bloomberg interview hosted by David Ingles with the invited guest, UBS Global Wealth Management regional chief investment officer Kelvin Tay on April 11.

“Tay argued that Malaysia had a current account deficit. This is quite scary as Malaysia has always prided itself as an economy with a current account surplus, with our value of exports well-exceeding imports being one of the country's key strengths.

“For example, in 2018, Malaysia registered a current account surplus of 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Given Malaysia's very healthy trade surplus so far, the country's current account balance will remain in surplus for 2019,” Pua said.

 He said Malaysia does, however, have a moderate fiscal deficit, which is typical of developing countries, whereby for 2018, the deficit was 3.7 per cent of GDP and is projected to fall to 3.4 per cent this year.

Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has also projected that Malaysia's fiscal deficit would further decline to three per cent for 2020 and less than 2.8 per cent for 2021.

Commenting on Tay's claims that oil revenue made up 30 per cent of Malaysia's GDP, Pua said this is incorrect and Malaysia is well-recognised by the investment community as having a fairly diversified economy.

Pua highlighted that Malaysia's mining (including the oil and gas sector), manufacturing and services sectors made up 7.9 per cent, 23 per cent and 55.5 per cent of the GDP in 2018, respectively. - Bernama"

“We expect the project to enhance the Cambodia-based gaming company’s scale and operating performance without significantly straining its cash flow leverage,” it said on Friday.

The ratings agency said it expects NagaCorp (B+/Stable/--) to fund 50% of Naga3’s total development cost with internal cash flows, with the rest coming in via equity infusion from Chen.

NagaCorp estimates the total project cost to be about US$3.52bil, and will complete it over the six years to 2025. 

Investment in the Naga3 project is likely to be back-ended, with 25%-30% capital investment over 2019-2021. 

“We expect the company’s total capital spending, including maintenance capital expenditure, refurbishment of the Naga1 gaming complex, and the capital outlay for Naga3, to be around US$500mil in the next two years. 

“We estimate NagaCorp’s EBITDA will increase gradually to US$900mil by 2021, from US$516mil in 2018. Also, the company has a moderate amount of debt of about US$300 mil as of Dec. 31, 2018,” it said. 

S&P Global Ratings believes NagaCorp has sufficient flexibility to increase its leverage if needed without breaching its downside trigger of a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times.

Growing contribution from high net worth customers (70%-75%) in 2019-2021 should support EBITDA growth. 

It said NagaCorp’s operating cash flows should also increase to US$550mil-US$650mil over the period, from about US$470mil in 2018. 

“In our view, the company has financial headroom to accommodate the additional capital spending for Naga3 while continuing to pay high dividends, which we estimate will be US$250mil–US$300mil annually over the next two to three years.

“In our view, NagaCorp will continue to pursue an aggressive expansion policy. The company announced the Naga3 project just 15 months after it commissioned Naga2,” it said. 

Currently, NagaCorp is refurbishing its Naga1 property and completing a gaming project in Vladivostok, Russia. 

“Such expansion is opportunistic and necessary for the company’s growth, and is funded at least partly by equity issuance. 

“Nevertheless, such an aggressive investment appetite continues to constrain our assessment of NagaCorp’s credit quality,” it said."

“If it (the special division) is formed, when Chinese investors come here and we arrange for meetings and assist them until they get approval (for their investments), they will be able to see that things are moving fast. We will gain their trust,” he told Bernama.

Daim said the formation of this division was requested by both Chinese and local investors, adding that he had already briefed Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad on this.

As for local investors, the CEP chairman advised them to be ready for spillover effects, as the project workers would need services such as accommodation and food.

He said with a price tag of RM44 billion, the rail project is by far the biggest, especially for the people in the East Coast, and therefore the residents and businesses there should take the advantage of this project.

“So, if the locals are smart and take advantage of this (project), they can help improve (investment) spending and generate revenue. This is one way to boost gross domestic product growth,” he explained.

Daim also urged every state the rail link passes through, and the residents in the vicinity of the ECRL stations, to promote their localities, specialities and services available.

“They must go out and say look, we have the infrastructure and we have the people who can work (for you). And I expect after the Prime Minister returns from his One Belt, One Road summit in China at end of this month, more advantages will be coming to us,” he added.

The Singapore-based firm announced today it had received a letter from Maybank terminating the agreement signed with Hyflux and its unit Tuaspring Pte Ltd in July 2018.

Under the agreement, the debt-laden Hyflux and Tuaspring Pte Ltd had agreed to the execution of a binding agreement with a successful bidder/investor for the full settlement and discharge of Maybank’s total liabilities by the ""standstill deadline”.

However, till today, there has been no execution of a binding agreement with a successful bidder/investor by the six-time extended standstill deadline, Hyflux said in a filing with the Singapore Exchange.

""(According to Maybank,) this constitutes a breach which is incapable of remedy under the collaboration agreement entitling Maybank to terminate the collaboration agreement,” it added.

Maybank is the only secured financier of Tuaspring with an exposure reportedly of about S$602.4mil for the latter’s IWPP.

Singapore’s national water agency, the Public Utilities Board (PUB), had on April 17 issued a notice to Tuaspring to terminate its water purchase agreement with Hyflux, aiming at safeguarding the country’s water security. The termination notice provides a 30-day notice period before PUB takes over Tuaspring’s desalination plant.

Hyflux is currently struggling to restructure its debts with its liabilities which reportedly stood at S$2.95bil as at March 31, 2018.

Hyflux also announced today that it had received notices from Maybank to PUB and the Energy Market Authority of Singapore in relation to the direct agreement between Tuaspring, PUB and the bank dated Nov 21, 2013.

""These notices are in respect of an enforcement event and acceleration of the maturity of all amounts owing under the Tuaspring financing documents,” it said.

Maybank has also stated its intention to appoint receivers and managers over the assets of Tuaspring save for the ""desalination plant and shared infrastructure”.

In the interim, Hyflux said the operations of the power plant at the Tuaspring IWPP were expected to continue as usual.

The termination of the collaboration agreement is expected to have a material impact on the financial performance of the group, it said.

Hyflux said it would make the appropriate announcements as and when there were any further material developments on this matter."

Dutch lender ING Groep NV has reached out to the bank and the German government to seek talks, and UniCredit SpA is weighing a potential bid, people familiar with the matter have said.The German Finance Ministry, which oversees the country’s roughly 15% stake in Commerzbank, has encouraged the firm’s negotiations with Deutsche Bank.Yet some within Germany’s government - which owns roughly 15% of Commerzbank - are critical of a national merger and would prefer a European solution. But the lack of a European deposit insurance scheme and a still-fragmented capital market in the region are posing big hurdles for a cross-border takeover. That’s less of a problem for banks that already have a large presence in the German market and are looking to expand there.Here are some potential suitors that have emerged or are likely to emerge for Commerzbank should its talks with Deutsche Bank collapse:> ING GroepRalph Hamers, chief executive officer of the biggest Dutch bank, has reached out to his Commerzbank counterpart, Martin Zielke, and to the German government in an effort to start discussions. Hamers even pledged to cut fewer jobs than a Commerzbank-Deutsche Bank deal would require, and to move ING’s headquarters to Frankfurt from Amsterdam, according to Manager Magazin, which first reported the talks. Zielke rejected formal discussions but hasn’t broken off contact completely, the publication said.ING already ranks among the biggest retail banks in Germany with more than eight million customers, and its online-only strategy there might fit well with Commerzbank’s Comdirect business. A deal would also bolster ING’s push into corporate banking in Germany. The potential to cut costs is lower because ING doesn’t have any branches in Germany.> UniCreditItaly’s UniCredit has considered making a bid for Commerzbank and could approach the German lender if talks with Deutsche Bank fall apart, a person familiar with the matter said. The multibillion-euro plan under deliberation involves buying a sizable stake in Commerzbank and merging it with HypoVereinsbank, which UniCredit already owns, according to the Financial Times, which broke the news.A representative for UniCredit declined to comment.A takeover would probably face opposition from the German government because of UniCredit’s significant exposure to Italian sovereign debt, so a transaction would probably require a complex structure. UniCredit executives held discussions with German officials about Commerzbank in 2017, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time.Combining HypoVereinsbank with Commerzbank would give Unicredit or any other buyer greater access to the so-called Mittelstand companies, or the mid-sized businesses that are the backbone of the German economy.> BNP ParibasLike UniCredit, BNP Paribas SA is said to have held talks already in 2017 with the German government about buying its stake in Commerzbank. The French lender emerged largely unscathed from the turmoil that rocked its European peers over the past decade, and banking executives have speculated that CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafe may now consider dealmaking to accelerate his expansion. A takeover of Commerzbank would create a Franco-German entity that dwarfs Deutsche Bank in terms of revenue and earnings. A spokeswoman for BNP said the bank has no acquisition plans. — Bloomberg"

The average size of single-family homes that sold shrank for a third time, pulling the median price down 17% in the first quarter from a year earlier to US$1.69mil, appraiser Miller Samuel Inc and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate said in a report yesterday. 
Meanwhile, the number of luxury houses on the market jumped 68% to 232.
“There’s been a steady shift in the mix,” Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, said in an interview. 
“There’s still demand for high-end homes, but nowhere near the density of a decade or so ago. There are too many properties on the market, too many sellers, and Wall Street isn’t the driver of demand it once was.”
In recent years, luxury buyers have gotten more options in other New York suburbs and Manhattan’s new condo towers. 
That’s weighed heavily on Greenwich, where sellers aren’t pricing their properties competitively enough, Miller said. 
Single-family home sales tumbled 25% to 74, the fewest for a first quarter in eight years, according to the report.
Federal tax reform, which capped deductions for state and local levies to US$10,000, didn’t help. The average property-tax bill in Fairfield County, including Greenwich, was US$10,754 last year – the eighth highest in the country, according to Attom Data Solutions.
Condos – generally smaller, less expensive and closer to transit – are a bright spot. 
Purchases jumped 33% to 32, with a median price of US$681,500, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said.
David Haffenreffer, brokerage manager of Houlihan Lawrence’s Greenwich office, is optimistic. 
The key spring selling season got started later than usual this year, so the second quarter could show a stronger market, he said.
“We’re seeing a definite pickup in activity,” he said in an interview. “Our agents are wall-to-wall busy with showings, there are negotiations going on and contingent contracts and pending deals going on now.” — Bloomberg"

Meanwhile, as speculation swirls over whether the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies will extend output cuts, Asian buyers of sanctioned Iranian oil are said to be putting purchases on hold as they await a White House decision on waivers.While oil has advanced over 40% this year on the back of the Opec+ coalition’s supply curbs, the rally’s run out of steam in the past couple of weeks. May could be a pivotal month for the market as the US decides on whether to extend waivers allowing some countries to keep buying Iranian crude, while a meeting of Opec and its allies in Saudi Arabia may provide clues on future production levels.“Investors are taking a wait-and-see stance ahead of events in May, including the expiry of waivers on US sanctions on Iran and the Opec meeting,” said Kei Kobashi, a senior analyst at Sumitomo Corp Global Research Co.“It will remain difficult to make bets until May because there is so much uncertainty.”West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery fell 4 cents to US$63.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 11:39am in Singapore yesterday.

The contract fell 10 cents to US$71.62 on Wednesday and is little changed so far this week. The global benchmark crude was at a premium of US$7.74 to WTI for the same month.Before the Energy Information Administration released its crude inventories data on Wednesday, which showed the first drop in four weeks, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report a decline of 3.1 million barrels. The median forecast in a survey of analysts by Bloomberg before the government data pointed to an increase of 2.3 million barrels in US stockpiles.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday there would likely be discussions about whether Opec and its allies would extend production cuts at their meeting in Jeddah next month. His nation’s average output cuts in April would conform to the Opec+ coalition’s deal, he said, adding that it’s too early to talk about possible options for the group in regards to the future of the output reductions.Most Asian crude buyers are avoiding imports from Iran for next month as it’s unclear what would happen to the US exemptions that are set to expire in the first week of May, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this week. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/19/enigma-of-weidmann-looms-over-race-to-succeed-draghi-at-ecb/,Enigma of Weidmann looms over race to succeed Draghi at ECB,Banking,"Friday, 19 Apr 2019",,"Frankfurt: European leaders wondering whether Jens Weidmann (pic) should replace Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank (ECB) have two competing views of the Bundesbank chief to choose from.
One perspective, shared by some of his ECB colleagues, is that the German has been a thorn in the side of the current president for too long to shake off an aura of fundamentalism. Another, hinted at by Weidmann himself, is that of a pragmatist who can bend to the requirements of his office.
The Bundesbanker has made a corresponding journey from being the chief opponent of Draghi’s monetary expansion to a more restrained and mercurial role in ECB policy. 
The test Weidmann faces is whether that shift has come too late for him to be credible leading an institution that could plausibly be required to firefight another existential crisis.
“We’ve watched in the last two years how his communication has changed – how it has gotten more compatible with the situation in more southern member states,” said Ricardo Garcia, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief eurozone economist. 
“We think Weidmann’s cards aren’t that bad.”
His chances of succeeding Draghi will hinge on a carve-up of senior European Union (EU) positions that the bloc’s leaders are planning after the European Parliament elections in late May. 
That negotiation will focus firstly on nationality, though leaders know they need to choose someone suitable for the job too.
During Weidmann’s time on the Governing Council, he’s been a more strident opponent than the other frontrunners to the major policies that defined the Draghi era. Here are some of the quandaries he could face if he gets the presidency.
Negative rates
A deterioration of the economy could force the ECB into another round of easing. Policy makers, including Draghi, say they still have tools at their disposal, and one response would be to cut interest rates still further. 
The ECB’s deposit rate is now at minus 0.4%, but Switzerland has shown that minus 0.75% is doable.
Although renowned for his hawkish views, Weidmann has previously spoken in favour of using negative rates. He said in 2014 – the year the ECB took its deposit rate below zero – that they could revive the interbank market and spur lending to companies.
“I’m not sure he’s quite as much as a hawk as portrayed,” said Stewart Robertson, European economist at Aviva. 
“He is a Bundesbank-type person, but I think everyone who has taken on the role as governor of the ECB has tried to do so looking at the eurozone as a whole.”
Quantitative easing
Further asset purchases could help boost inflation if the ECB’s recently announced long-term loans prove insufficient. 
Weidmann was slow to acknowledge the legitimacy of quantitative easing before it was implemented in 2015. Since then, however, he has argued the programme has certain safeguards – such as weighting each country’s share according to the size of its economy –that make it less prone to it being turned into a tool for debt mutualisation.
The problem for Weidmann is that if he wanted to reactivate QE, he might need to override the sovereign-bond safeguards he argued for because the ECB has already bought so much government debt.
Outright monetary transactions
Weidmann’s most persistent opposition to Draghi was on the president’s Outright Monetary Transactions bond-buying plan, a tool whose unveiling in 2012 helped stem the region’s sovereign-debt crisis despite never having been deployed. The Bundesbank chief even testified in court on his reservations.
But a new debt crisis, perhaps centered on Italy, could put pressure on officials to activate the programme. It would first require a country to ask for help and subscribe to reforms. 
“If Weidmann gets the role and possibly has to use the OMT programme, that’ll be difficult for him,” said Marc Bruetsch, chief economist at insurer Swiss Life. 
Meanwhile, “if he, as an opponent of the OMT programme comes to the ECB and scraps OMT, then Draghi’s promise to do ‘whatever it takes’ is also essentially off the table.”
Helicopter money
While the ECB’s crusade against feeble inflation in recent years has led it to enact a series of never-before-tested measures, the institution’s fight against deflation hasn’t yet reached the point of considering cash distributions to the public. 
That idea was once proposed by the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman.
“Were they to have to do something radical like helicopter money, that’s where the choice of the president would play an important role,” said Andrew Bosomworth, a money manager at Pimco. 
“Under some people this would be harder to implement than under others.”
Tightening
The ECB has committed to keeping rates on hold at rock bottom for the rest of this year, given a slowdown in global momentum and concerns about trade disputes and Brexit. There could always be an upside surprise, forcing the ECB to begin unwinding its extraordinary stimulus. That might be the easiest policy for Weidmann to implement, given his history.
“The signs are that from now on or from shortly onward, it will get better,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, told Bloomberg Surveillance. — Bloomberg"

The Stoxx Europe 600 is still stuck in a tight range as the earnings season is getting in full swing. The first results have been generally ok so far, albeit with a low bar. Looking at sector performances, the mining sector is still the top this year and miners have been partying on soaring iron ore prices. But there’s a shift in the newsflow this week, which could crash the party.Rio Tinto was first to cut its production targets, in a widely expected move. BHP Group followed through with a similar warning. This isn’t a big deal given soaring iron ore prices were still guaranteeing a decent margin improvement that would largely compensate lower volumes and cost inflation. Vale’s unexpected swift restart of production may be a game changer.Among the members of the Stoxx 600 basic resources index (SXPP), Rio and BHP are the most impacted by iron ore price moves, with 43% and 35% of 2018 revenues respectively, while Anglo American has a 13% exposure.Outside the sub-index, Ferrexpo is the main pure play.Iron ore shipment issues might not be over just yet, the risk could lie in prices getting ahead of themselves in anticipation of massive shortages that may not materialise in the end. It will impact the SXPP as Rio, BHP and Anglo have a 49% weight in the index.Analysts have yet to adjust their forecasts, while all three stocks already trade near or above consensus price targets.It’s not just iron ore, though. Copper is still one of the main drivers of miners’ performance. Prices stalled since the end of February, but seemed to have broken out yesterday. Voices are also warning that the market will go into deficit this year. In fact, opportunities might arise from other metals’ moves, especially as China’s growth held unexpectedly well in the first quarter, and further stimulus measures are still on the table.HSBC analysts wrote in a note this week that EPS sensitivity is relatively high to base metals for South32 and Glencore, seeing significant potential EPS upside from spot in aluminium, copper, nickel and thermal coal prices. Both stocks have substantial leverage to changes in these commodities’ spot prices, they said.In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading down 0.3% ahead of the open, while investors are getting more skeptical about the rally, seeing the Stoxx Europe 600 falling almost 9% by the end of the year, as our latest survey shows. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/19/is-spain-about-to-become-the-next-italy/,Is Spain about to become the next Italy?,Economy,"Friday, 19 Apr 2019",,"By Ferdinando GiuglianoANTI-establishment parties have made real inroads in southern Europe in recent years, taking power in Italy and Greece after vowing to jettison mainstream political thinking and challenge the economic consensus in Brussels. As Spain goes to the polls this month, many are worried about the rise of Vox, an anti-immigrant, anti-feminist movement that has emerged as a genuine electoral force. For those troubled by Europe’s turn toward populism, though, Madrid is a long way from going down the path of Rome, let alone Budapest or Warsaw. Mainstream parties remain solidly in the lead, meaning the next government probably won’t be too different from what has come before. Even though this is the third national election in four years, the Spanish economy has withstood the instability.None of this is to downplay the fears about Vox, whose arrival on the scene has so enthused Steve Bannon - the former Donald Trump adviser and nationalist rabble-rouser.In December, it became the first far-right party to win seats in a regional Spanish election (Andalusia) since the death of the military dictator Francisco Franco. Its votes were decisive in putting into power a coalition of the center-right People’s Party and the centrist Ciudadanos, ending the Socialists’ 36 years of rule in Andalusia. Vox is on course to win about 10% of the votes in the general election. That’s pretty remarkable for an organization only founded in late 2013.Vox is, of course, not the only anti-establishment party winning votes in Spain. Podemos, the extreme left party led by Pablo Iglesias, is faring much worse than in 2015, when it came close to beating the Socialists in a national election. But polls still give it about 12-13 % of the vote, which might make it a player in the post-election coalition building. Regional parties are strong too, including the pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia.As Antonio Barroso, a researcher at consulting firm Teneo notes, there are lots of undecided voters, perhaps as many as four in 10. But the big theme of this election is the fragmentation of the electorate. The two parties that have dominated Spanish politics for the past four decades, the Socialists and the People’s Party, are struggling to win more than half the total votes between them. So will Madrid be pulled to the extremes, as Bannon hopes?Fortunately for the more moderate-minded, it looks unlikely. There are three possible outcomes to this election, and none appears particularly alarming. The first would see the ruling Socialist Party, riding high in the polls at about 30%, forming a left-of-center coalition with the support of Podemos and some regional parties. Alternatively, Pedro Sanchez, the party’s chief, might turn toward the center and try to form an alliance with Ciudadanos, even though its leader Albert Rivera has ruled this out.Should Sanchez manage to cobble together either of these partnerships (far from a given), there’s not much for the European Union or investors to worry about. As prime minister, he has followed a classic left-wing agenda, proposing tax hikes on the rich and the banks to fund benefit spending. Nadia Calvino, the economy minister, is a former senior EU official and is unlikely to want to upset Brussels if she stays in office.Even in partnership with Podemos, Spain would probably behave like Portugal, where Antonio Costa’s left-wing government has cut the budget deficit by prioritizing social spending over areas such as infrastructure.The second electoral possibility is a right-wing government formed by the People’s Party and Ciudadanos with the support of Vox, as in Andalusia. This is hard to imagine given the Socialists’ poll lead and the squeamishness within Rivera’s centrist party about his shift to the right. Still, a center-right coalition wouldn’t be a disaster for the economy. It would almost certainly pursue lower taxes, funded via reduced spending. That’s hardly the same as Italy’s right-wing League, which wants a “flat tax” but is unwilling to make cuts to pay for it.The third potential outcome is that the political fragmentation is too great to allow the creation of a government. In that case, Spain would go back to the polls, perhaps as soon as the Autumn. Obviously, it would be far better for the mainstream candidates to compromise on a program to support the country’s recovery, which has slowed but remains robust. Yet even if they don’t, the economy has proven itself resilient to the absence of strong government.Investors seem sanguine. The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds is only slightly more than a percentage point higher than the German equivalent, and well below Italy’s. After all the drama that’s gripped southern Europe in this decade, including the Catalan crisis, Spain still looks relatively unexciting.And that’s meant as a compliment. — Bloomberg Opinion"

At the same time, the state government is happy because among the vendors, many of them use raw materials imported from Malaysi. Hence, their presence here will give us the opportunity to maximise (usage) of our raw materials,” he added.Citing an example, he said the raw materials used to make car mirror lining and other components based on rubber could stimulate the economic growth of the nation through the use of local raw materials.Besides that, he said, the job opportunities created were not only for those who have been with Proton but it also beckons new opportunities.“If Proton brings workers from Shah Alam, they are only involved in car manufacturing, but when the vendors come here, their presence will open up job opportunities that will develop immediately,” he explained.On skilled manpower required for the new operations, Nizar said the Sultan Azlan Shah Polytechnic in Behrang produced sufficient graduates in automotive manufacturing including artificial intelligence field, computer and others. — Bernama"

The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index inched forward on strong March retail sales data, which registered their greatest increase in 1-1/2 years, and upbeat results from Union Pacific Corp and Honeywell International Inc.

""The retail sales number was very strong,"" said Jeffrey Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments in New York. ""It puts to rest the recession fear.""

The MSCI All-Country World Index fell 0.1% but came off session lows to tick just above last Friday's closing level.

Lackluster French and German surveys of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector for April, which showed activity continuing to contract, prompted selling among some investors.

Activity in Germany's services sector rose to a seven-month high in April, but investors focused on the 44.5 reading for the manufacturing sector, well below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction even if it was above the 44.1 reading last month.

The weak surveys out of Europe followed a report on Japanese manufacturing activity that showed new export orders fell at the fastest pace in almost three years.

""The flash PMIs that came out were very weak,"" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management. ""But retail sales were strong, so that helped (U.S. stocks), and earnings were strong.""

Despite the lackluster European and Japanese data, global growth has showed signs of troughing, said Schulze, who pointed to Wednesday's better-than-expected Chinese economic data.

""It does appear that the Chinese economy hit an inflection point in March, so the weakness we're seeing in Germany and Europe is likely coming to an end,"" he said.

The release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election had little impact on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 110 points, or 0.42%, to 26,559.54, the S&P 500 gained 4.58 points, or 0.16%, to 2,905.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.98 points, or 0.02%, to 7,998.06.

The underwhelming French and German manufacturing survey data pushed down yields on German Bund and U.S. Treasury yields.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.5596%, from 2.592% late on Wednesday.

""The retail sales report was great, but (investors) seem to be focused on the fact that the data are struggling out of Europe,"" said Mary Anne Hurley, vice president of fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle, referring to activity in U.S. Treasuries.

The euro also fell to its lowest in more than a week after the European manufacturing data, and was last down 0.6% on the day at $1.1231.

Conversely, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.5% on the strength of U.S. retail sales data.

Oil prices rose after a drop in crude exports from OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and a draw in U.S. drilling rigs and oil inventories.

Brent crude futures rose 35 cents to settle at $71.97 a barrel, a 0.49% gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 24 cents to settle at $64 a barrel, a 0.38% gain. - Reuters"

StoneCo and PagSeguro, which are both listed in New York, were down 22.5 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively, while Cielo fell 8 percent on the São Paulo stock exchange.

Rede, Itaú's card processor, said on Wednesday evening it would advance payments to merchants in as little as two days, compared with the usual 30-day period, charging no interest, which will increase competition in the payments sector.

The bank's two requirements for the service are that clients have a checking account with Itaú and annual revenues no higher than 30 million reais ($7.63 million), Itaú said in a statement.

Card processors in Brazil charge discount rates to advance cash in a business that has become increasingly important to their business models.

Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients that this payment model was likely to become ""the new standard,"" hurting all card processors' results.

""All in all, as a reference, we estimate an annualized net profit impact of 32 percent for Stone and 19 percent for Cielo, all else held equal,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote.

The impact on PagSeguro, however, may be less painful, as it already offers payments for micro-merchants in two days.

Brazil's antitrust watchdog, Cade, sent Itau a request for more information on the decision to cut interest rates, asking for an answer by May 3, according to a document released on Thursday. - Reuters"

Speculation lingers that Japan will once again delay raising the tax to 10 percent from 8 percent, even though Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly said he will proceed with the increase unless there's a major economic shock.

Abe has twice postponed the planned tax hike -- needed to meet rising social welfare costs as the population ages -- since the last increase to 8 percent from 5 percent in April 2014 hit consumer spending and triggered an economic slump.

To avoid a repeat of that, Abe's government has earmarked 2 trillion yen ($17.9 billion) in various spending measures to try to temper any economic downturn.

About 80 percent of companies surveyed say authorities should go ahead with the hike, the poll showed.

Some 18 percent said no extra stimulus was needed, but 61 percent said additional steps are necessary.

""To prevent consumption from slumping after the tax hike, further tax breaks will be needed, such as increasing items subjected to lower tax rates,"" a manager of a construction firm wrote in the survey.

Just 21 percent said the planned tax increase should be scrapped altogether, according to the April 3-15 survey.

GROWTH OR REFORM?

Some respondents said boosting government spending defeats the point of the tax hike.

""Raising the tax is meaningless if it involves stimulus to boost spending,"" a service firm manager wrote in the survey.

Others expressed concern that the tax hike would undermine Japan's economic growth, which is already weak.

""Even with higher taxes, government revenue won't increase because consumer spending will decline and corporate profits will deteriorate,"" a manager of an electric machinery maker wrote.

Some economists have warned that Japan could slide into a recession as companies are feeling the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war and global slowdown, chilling business investment and demand.

Yet Japan needs to shore up its finances as its population rapidly greys. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) urged Japan on Monday to raise the sales tax to as high as 26 percent.

The Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 478 large and mid-sized firms with managers responding on condition of anonymity. About 230 firms answered the questions on the sales tax issue.

LONG HOLIDAY

Asked about their operational plans for the unprecedented 10-day holiday in late April and early May to mark the ascension of the new emperor, 47 percent of companies said they would partially halt operations and 38 percent said they would suspend business completely.

The remaining 15 percent said they don't plan to stop operations at all.

Nearly half, or 47 percent, said they didn't expect the long break to impact their business. Some 28 percent said they expected to see a drop in output or sales compared to a year earlier, while a quarter projected an increase.

Some reported seeing a bump up in demand as customers stock up on products to cope with the 10-day break as well as due to uncertainty about Brexit, the survey showed. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/19/uber-lands-us$1b-from-softbank-toyota-for-self-driving-unit/,"Uber lands US$1b from SoftBank, Toyota for self-driving unit",Corporate News,"Friday, 19 Apr 2019",8:37 AM MYT,"SAN FRANCISCO: Uber's autonomous vehicle unit has raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including SoftBank Group Corp, giving the company a much-needed funding boost for its pricey self-driving ambitions on the eve of its public stock offering.

Uber Technologies Inc <IPO-UBER.N> said on Thursday that the investment valued its Advanced Technologies Group, which works to develop autonomous driving technology, at $7.25 billion. SoftBank will invest $333 million from its $100 billion Vision Fund, while Toyota Motor Corp and automotive company Denso Corp will combined invest $667 million.

Reuters had reported in March talks of the investment in ATG, which has locations in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.

The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some investor concerns over Uber's spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1 billion since the program started in 2016.

The business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion. The company is not even offering free rides in the robot cars to passengers, like some of its rivals are, following a fatal crash last year in Arizona involving an Uber self-driving SUV.

Uber released its IPO filing this month and is preparing to launch is ""roadshow,"" when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Uber is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation, at least an 18 percent jump from its current $76 billion valuation.

As part of the deal, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber with its financial performance folded into Uber's. A new ATG board will be formed, with six seats from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board.

Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company's capital structure. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

A law enacted last year expands that group's powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defense applications.

SoftBank's investment in General Motors Co's self-driving car unit Cruise is still under CFIUS review and is likely weeks away from a decision, even though that investment was announced more than a year ago. - Reuters"

The NII growth was supported by higher gross loans which increased +8.0% y-o-y to THB230.9bil, and higher interest income on investments.

The stock, which set a record earlier this month, rose 1.2% yesterday morning.“Nestle continued to deliver,” said Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG. He pointed to measures taken last year that are starting to pay off, such as the revamp of US frozen food.Nestle achieved both better-than-expected pricing and volume growth, bolstering confidence that Schneider will succeed in accelerating sales growth again in 2019 after an extended six-year slowdown. Schneider has been revamping Nestle, having signed US$14bil of deals in 2018, including the purchase of licenses to sell coffee products under the Starbucks brand. The food giant has also been trying to fix or sell underperformers, with a sale for its Herta lunch-meat unit possibly coming by mid-year and its dermatological business by year-end.“This is a quality beat, which we believe is a clear support to the portfolio management story,” wrote Cedric Besnard, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets.The pricing gain of 1.2% was the biggest in 10 quarters as the KitKat maker passed higher raw-material costs on to consumers, especially in Brazil and the US. The businesses that were most hit by inflation include bottled water as higher oil prices make plastic and transport more expensive. Still, Europe and parts of the Pacific region such as Japan are suffering from deflation.Brazil improved to double-digit growth, while the US was boosted by Purina. Nestle’s ailing frozen-food unit in the US returned to growth in the quarter, led by Hot Pockets and Stouffer’s. Some investors have been pushing for a sale of those underperforming brands.Nestle’s Asia-Pacific business “had a subdued quarter and waters remains insipid, a problem Nestle needs to fix,” said Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies. Asia may have been impacted by an earlier Chinese New Year, while sales of Nestle’s low-end water brand Pure Life dropped. — Bloomberg"

Hopefully over time with the help of the government perhaps we can re-evaluate the situation and maybe we can open a bigger factory but it is not in our consideration at the moment,” he said.BAT, which is the country’s biggest cigarette maker had first announced a closure to its PJ plant in 2016 citing the reason then as falling sales as a result of high duties and the growing illegal cigarette trade.The decision then to close the PJ plant had seen 230 workers losing their jobs, according to earlier reports.The BAT PJ plant was reportedly closed in stages and a complete closure happened in the second half of 2017.Stoel said that the installation of the new Pakatan Harapan government about almost a year ago with a focus on clamping down on corruption and enforcement had brought some hope to the tobacco industry in Malaysia.“For the tobacco industry we can benefit.“The things that Harapan was talking about was to fight corruption, transparency, addressing affordability and focusing on (clamping down) illicit trade. “We all know what has happened, what they have done and what they can still do. We have seen a government that are willing to tackle some of the issues or pitfalls we have in this country,” Stoel said.“These are good things and we see a lot of good intent and the question is about how fast do we get there. “If you talk about the consumer, affordability plays a major part and for the average consumer they still struggle to buy a pack of cigarettes for as long as there is a pack of illegal cigarettes on sale. So this has a bit of an impact on us,” he said.Stoel said he hopes the government will maintain vigilant enforcement actions against illegal cigarettes moving forward."

Cost savings from these two projects amounted to RM23.84bil.Also, it said, the revival of the renegotiated  East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, which now costs RM44bil from RM65.5bil previously, along with the Penang LRT and the Pan Island Link 1 projects would provide impetus to growth.The research house, in its Main Themes of 2Q2019 Economic Outlook report, noted that Brent crude oil had posted its best quarterly performance in a decade.Although its base case oil projection for Brent is US$62–US$65 per barrel on average, the research house said it could touch its best case, which is US$65–US$68 per barrel on average, for 2019 if current trends persist.“Furthermore, with the government’s commitment to consolidating its fiscal consolidation, it implies that private expenditure will continue to spearhead growth. “While the public sector undergoes rationalisation and exports moderate despite supportive measures from China gaining traction and somewhat cushioning our softening exports, the policy measures will continue to support private spending,” it said.It expects 2019 gross domestic product to grow around 4.5%, with the first half of the year likely to average at 4.2% and second half at 4.8%. The research house forecasts inflation at 1% for 2019.“With slower growth and softer inflation, the monetary policy will remain accomodative. Room for monetary easing biasness remains, especially if business and consumer sentiments remain weak,” it said.Ambank Research said the ringgit against the US dollar is unlikely to appreciate sharply in comparison to its regional peers, and expects the ringgit to be around 4.10. It added that exporters should get some relief, as the currency is still being undervalued against the US dollar.It said Malaysia’s bond yields, meanwhile, would be supported by healthy macro fundamentals like steady growth, healthy reserves, a current account surplus, low inflation and real money flows. The research house said it expected the gross issuance of Malaysian Government Securities (MGS)/Government Investment Issue in the primary market in 2019 to hover at around RM120bil and RM125bil, while the corporate bond and sukuk market is expected to see a total issuance of RM80bil–RM85bil."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/19/wait-for-it-why-boeing-737-max-software-fix-is-taking-so-long/,Wait for it: Why Boeing 737 Max software fix is taking so long,Airlines,"Friday, 19 Apr 2019",,"ATLANTA: In the days after a Boeing Co 737 Max 8 jet plunged into Indonesia’s Java Sea last October, company officials said they were moving quickly to update plane software suspected in the crash.Six months and a second Max 8 disaster later, Boeing has yet to submit its fix to regulators. Last week, pilots and its airline customers left a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) meeting with no idea when the grounded model would fly again. “We’ve taken off our watches and put the calendars in the drawer,” American Airlines pilot Dennis Tajer said after the meeting.What’s taking so long?Fixing software, it turns out, is no easy task. “Any time you change software code, it’s a major issue,’’ said Clint Balog, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University professor who studies the interaction between humans and computers in planes. “If you change even one small thing in a code, it can have downstream implications.’’The jet’s anti-stall device, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), has now been implicated in October’s Lion Air crash and last month’s Ethiopian Airlines disaster, which occurred while the software fix was underway. An update turns out to be more complicated than Boeing anticipated, both politically and technically.In a video message on Wednesday night, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company had finished its last test flight and was prepared to move forward with certification. The goal, he said, is to make the 737 Max “one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.’’His company needs to convince the now heavily scrutinised FAA – as well as skeptical international regulators – that the fix is safe and capable of being used in the Max 8 without requiring costly flight-simulator training for pilots, as the company has promised customers. That could prove tricky in the current environment, said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft consultant and vice-president at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.“I suspect the time spent so far is less about creating optimal software and more about proving to regulators that it’s OK,’’ Aboulafia said. The tradition of non-US aircraft regulators deferring to the FAA’s judgment calls is “hanging by a thread. The system now has many agencies who are determined to show that they have independent oversight.’’Cracks are already showing. On Wednesday, a day after an FAA-appointed pilot board’s recommended that the US not mandate simulator training for the Max 8, Canada’s transport minister said the training should be required no matter how long the planes remain grounded.Complicating Boeing’s task is the increasingly complex interplay between artificial intelligence, hardware and humans, aerospace and computer experts say.Software engineers needed to ferret out ripple effects and unintended consequences, said Eric Feron, an aerospace software engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “You have to look at the way the human is going to operate the plane. You have to consider the interactions with hardware, and other software,’’ he said. “We want to be sure, if we can be sure, that we have no negative interactions between software systems.’’MCAS proved vulnerable to those kinds of interactions. It relied on data from just one piece of hardware – a sensor that malfunctioned – before putting a plane into a dive that pilots didn’t see coming.The use of software, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation systems continues to expand, not only to fly planes but to drive cars (and even decide who gets parole or a mortgage). When designed well, such systems can prevent fatigue and help humans make better decisions. Risks emerge when they aren’t designed to manage the back-and-forth between human and machine, particularly when automation changes in ways the user doesn’t expect. In the case of the Max 8, pilots initially weren’t told the MCAS existed. — Bloomberg"

The proposed early termination will allow MBNS to terminate the lease of the six transponders on the M3b satellite which it no longer requires.”Astro said the Measat-3d spacecraft shall consist of Ku-band payload which comprises of 12 Ku-band transponders.The Ku-band transponders feature high equivalent isotropic radiated power levels over Malaysia.The Malaysia payload of Measat-3d Ku-band, as a subject of the M3d Agreement, consists of 12 simultaneously operable Ku-band transponders, with each channel having a usable bandwidth of 36MHz and travelling wave tube amplifiers’ (TWTA) power of 150 Watts.Each transponder has a usable bandwidth of 36MHz with 4MHz guard bands.Depending on the transponders’ configurations and operational constraints, there will be at least three redundant TWTAs to back up the highly reliable primary units in a flexible ring redundant system. In addition, a redundant receiver is provided to ensure highest spacecraft reliability.Furthermore, as the Measat-3d satellite will be co-located with the current MBNS satellites, the satellite dishes of MBNS’ subscribers would not need to be re-positioned, thereby minimising any disruption to MBNS’ DTH service."

The government plans to spread its aid over seven years. Felda will raise about half of this, which will be backed by government guarantees, while the remainder will come from loans and grants. Felda was established in 1956 to manage the resettlement of the rural poor and employ them in Malaysia’s palm oil industry, but it has evolved into a financially independent statutory body supporting broader socio-economic development. Felda’s financial performance has been deteriorating since 2013. In 2017, its losses reached RM4.9bil compared to an average profit of RM700mil in the five years leading up to the listing of its commercial arm, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd  (now known as FGV Holdings Bhd), in 2012. This is attributable to declining operating income from plantations due to lower palm oil prices, financially unviable investment decisions, alleged corruption and weak governance practices.Felda’s financial difficulties became particularly apparent after the listing of Felda Global Ventures. Since then, its total liabilities have more than doubled to RM14.4bil from RM6.5bil. With its cash balance shrinking, Felda is unlikely to be able to meet its debt obligations without the government’s assistance.It recorded a RM4.6bil loss in earnings before interest and tax in 2017."

At a media roundtable yesterday, he said reviving the mega ECRL project has instilled greater investor confidence in Malaysia from the Chinese.
“Greater confidence in Malaysia will attract more Chinese to come here for economic and infrastructure development. There is a long queue of Chinese investments outside the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) office,” he said, adding that Malaysia was an ideal place for Chinese investments.
The amicable settlement on the ECRL is important for Chinese firms, as they do not want their investments to suffer the fate of a suspension like the ECRL, which Malaysia at one point wanted to scrap.
The top Chinese envoy said the revival of the ECRL augured well for Malaysia-China relations, and this, in turn, would have a positive impact on Chinese investors.
Bai Tian added that future Chinese investments would meet Malaysia’s economic development needs, with the high-tech industry being a key area.
“My embassy has been working round the clock talking to potential investors and inviting them to come,” he said.
According to Bai Tian, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s official visit to China next week would provide further impetus to attract more Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) into Malaysia.
After Dr Mahathir’s last visit to China in August, a Chinese firm involved in recycling made a major investment in Kedah.
Last year, Chinese manufacturing investments in Malaysia totaled about RM20bil, the biggest industrial FDI into the country.
Bai Tian said Dr Mahathir may witness “possible cooperation document signings”. These documents being worked out now could be government-to-business and business-to-government deals.
On palm oil, he said Malaysia can expect higher purchase from China this year.
“We are keen to increase the Malaysian palm oil trade and have been encouraging our companies to buy more Malaysian palm oil and related products,” said Bai Tian.
“I believe the (purchase) number will increase this year. We have been telling Chinese buyers to buy more local palm oil and products. 
“We do not impose a ceiling on the purchase of palm oil and products,” he added, after briefing the media on the upcoming Belt and Road Summit and Dr Mahathir’s visit to China.
The envoy said “demand is very huge for Malaysian palm oil” in China, which has a population of 1.4 billion, as it is of high quality and competitive in pricing.
“I hope this year we will witness more purchase of Malaysian palm oil,” said the envoy at the two-hour roundtable.
China is the third-biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil in the world, but the largest purchaser of Malaysian palm oil and related products.
Last year, Malaysia exported 3.07 million tonnes of palm oil and palm products with a total value of RM8.38bil to China. This was 7.3% more than the 2.86 million tonnes of palm oil sold at RM9.39bil in 2017.
The ambassador said China is looking at upstream and downstream cooperation with Malaysian oil palm companies.
“The downstream area will be good for cooperation. We can help upgrade your industries to a higher level and add value (to their products),” he said.
On Monday, Dr Mahathir said Malaysia has asked China to buy more palm oil, at the conclusion of the new deal on the ECRL.
He told reporters: “We are taking advantage of the signing of the ECRL agreement to work out the purchase of palm oil from China, that will happen.”
Dr Mahathir will be meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang separately on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Summit to be held from April 25 to 27."

Investors are now paying the price for that discrepancy: all five maturities have fallen since trading started last week, in some cases by more than 2 US cents on the US dollar.“We view the company as more of a Saudi risk rather than just an energy company,” said Patrick Wacker, a fund manager at Singapore-based UOB Asset Management Ltd. who dumped his holdings on the first day of trading to profit from the initial euphoria. He predicts the debt will keep falling until it trades at a yield premium to the Saudi government.If he’s right, there’s still a ways to go before the Aramco bond selloff is over. The company’s US$3bil of notes due in 2029 yielded 3.78% on Wednesday, less than the 3.91% on similar-maturity Saudi government debt sold in January.Given the order size at the sale, many investors expected the world’s biggest oil producer, known officially as Saudi Arabian Oil Co, would get away with lower yields than the government and instead be compared with global peers such as London-based BP Plc, whose notes due in 2028 yielded 3.51% on Wednesday.That’s not an unreasonable assumption. With US$111.1bil of net income in 2018, Aramco ranks as the most profitable company in the world. Even Moody’s Investors Service said this month it’s a contender for its top Aaa rating, yet “close inter-linkages” with the sovereign prompted it to grade Aramco in line with the Saudi government, which is ranked four steps lower at A1.“If it weren’t for its postcode it would most likely have come even tighter,” Anders Faergemann, a fund manager in London at PineBridge Investments, which oversees about US$90bil and owns Aramco bonds, said of the pricing. “Aramco is a bit of special case as it stirred interest from all types of investors, not just your usual emerging-market investors.”Aramco is integral to the economy of Saudi Arabia, which has been ramping up debt sales in recent years as falling oil prices left it with budget deficits. The oil industry accounted for more than 60% of the kingdom’s revenue in 2017 and about half of Aramco’s board is comprised of government officials. The money raised is also being used to finance Saudi Arabia’s economic agenda after the state postponed until at least 2021 plans to sell a stake in Aramco in an initial public offering.The 2029 notes were trading at 97.67 US cents on the dollar on Wednesday, compared with an issue price of 99.516.“We did not participate in the new deal as they priced inside the sovereign,” said Wouter Van Overfelt, a Zurich-based senior money manager at Vontobel Asset Management. “While there may be good reasons for this to be the case, we would generally prefer the sovereign in such cases.”Still, investors such as PineBridge in London and TCW Group Inc in Los Angeles say they are staying put, expecting volatility will eventually ease. The bonds were particularly vulnerable to the recent selloff in US Treasuries, but the long-term fundamentals of the company make it worth the risk, they say. — Bloomberg"

Yesterday, TSMC reported a larger-than-anticipated 32% plunge in net income during the January to March period.TSMC is showing the strains of a plateauing smartphone market as Apple, its biggest customer, seeks to boost growth with services rather than hardware.

The lender is among the biggest buyers of the structured securities, which have been compared to securitized products that soured during the global financial crisis.The agricultural ministry and the Financial Services Agency, which both oversee Norinchukin, are urging the bank to ensure it has an appropriate structure to manage risks tied to its securities investments, Agriculture Minister Takamori Yoshikawa told a Diet panel. Any losses on those investments could have a “significant impact” on the group’s banking units, which depend on returns being generated using their customers’ deposits, he said.Norinchukin has led a charge by Japanese banks into CLOs in recent years as they search for returns to make up for rock-bottom interest rates at home. The nation’s banks have grown more vulnerable to global credit markets as they increase investments in products overseas that could sour if the economy worsens, the Bank of Japan said in its semiannual financial system report on Wednesday.Tokyo-based Norinchukin’s holdings of collateralized debt obligations - a grouping that includes CLOs - jumped about 80% in the nine months through December to 6.8 trillion yen (US$61bil), according to company figures.While the bank buys the top-rated slices of the securities, FSA official Toshinori Yashiki said these could suffer losses depending on the performance of the underlying corporate loans.“The FSA has been strengthening regulation to ensure that an expansion of CLO investments will not undermine the stability of the financial system by creating systemic risks,” Yashiki said. “We will continue to closely monitor domestic and overseas economies and markets and take appropriate actions as necessary.”The FSA this year introduced a rule that increases the obligations of CLO investors.Norinchukin has been burned by investments in complex credit products before.After booking losses on mortgage-backed securities during the global financial crisis a decade ago, it turned to its cooperative members for a 1.9 trillion yen bailout. – Bloomberg"

But for techies interested in building the next generation of autonomous cars or supersonic jets, smaller cities may offer better opportunities.Job-seekers have good reason to search outside the top tech hubs.This is because smaller centres have less competition, lower costs and offer a different mix of jobs, according to a new study by job-search website operator Indeed Inc.Indeed’s study largely aligns with new US Census Bureau data population movement trends. “One interesting trend we are seeing this year is that metro areas not among the most populous are ranked in the top 10 for population growth,” said Sandra Johnson, a demographer in the bureau’s population division.Aside from the top eight tech hubs, which Indeed defined as metros with at least one million people where tech jobs account for a high share of total jobs, several smaller areas stood out.Robotics engineering jobs were prevalent in Pittsburgh, where Carnegie Mellon University is well known for its programmes in science and technology, and Detroit, where autonomous vehicle technology is being developed.Aerospace engineering jobs were common in places like Huntsville, Alabama or Lexington Park, Maryland, which boasts the country’s second highest average weekly earnings after behind Silicon Valley, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Lexington Park area has the nation’s highest concentration of aerospace engineer positions.In these smaller cities, job seekers can have the advantage because there are less people vying for the same spot. Still, the major tech hubs, in particular the Bay Area and Austin, continued to see an uptick in their share of tech workers.Jobs tend to spread out as industries mature.“But they’re still at the stage for many parts of the tech industry that the main clusters are where the action is, in particular the higher-paid, faster-growing tech jobs are especially concentrated in those big tech hubs,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab.The study results are consistent with the findings of Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists Simon Johnson and Jonathan Gruber.The two economists have identified 102 potential places which could develop into tech hubs if they received significant public investment. Topping their list of potential hubs are Pittsburgh, Columbus, Ohio, and Rochester and Syracuse in New York.“You need to boost spending on research and development to boost growth, and I think you get a better bang for your dollar away from the high-real-estate places like New York City or San Francisco,” Johnson said in an interview.While the concentration of jobs in coastal tech hubs is unlikely to be diluted any time soon, a survey of venture capital investors by the University of San Francisco found that confidence in the Bay Area’s entrepreneurial environment has fallen to a post-recession low. — Bloomberg"

The rating agency said on Thursday the financial assistance will add to the government’s debt burden, which is already significantly above the median of A-rated sovereigns.

“We estimate that the assistance will raise the government’s debt burden by 0.3% of GDP to 56.0% in 2019, substantially higher than median debt ratio for A-rated sovereigns of 37.8%  and up from 50.7% in 2017. 

“In our estimates, we include the debt of state-owned investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and RM20bil of funding provided to Tabung Haji, the state-owned pilgrimage fund, at the end of last year through an asset-backed sukuk,” it said.

Moody's cautioned that a higher debt burden will weigh on Malaysia's debt affordability, particularly because the share of revenue to GDP, at 16.3% in 2018, is likely remain at or near record lows. 

“Interest payments account for 13.3% of revenue, significantly higher than the A-rated median of 4%,” it said.
 
 
 To recap,  on April 10, the government (A3 stable) announced it would provide the RM6.2bil financial aid to Felda.
The announcement followed the release of a white paper that detailed the company’s deteriorating financial performance, and outlined plans to restore its viability and strengthen its governance practices. 

The government plans to spread its aid over seven years. Felda will raise about half of this, which will be backed by government guarantees, while the remainder will come from loans
and grants. 

Felda was established in 1956 to manage the resettlement of the rural poor and employ them in Malaysia's palm oil industry, but it has evolved into a financially independent statutory body supporting broader socio-economic development. 

Felda's financial performance has been deteriorating since 2013. In 2017, its losses reached RM4.9bil compared to an average profit of RM700mil in the five years leading up to the listing of its commercial arm, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd  (now known as FGV Holdings Bhd), in 2012, because of declining operating income from plantations due to lower palm oil prices, financially unviable investment decisions, alleged corruption and weak governance practices.

Felda's financial difficulties became particularly apparent after the listing of Felda Global Ventures. Since then, its total liabilities have more than doubled to RM14.4bil from RM6.5bil. 

With its cash balance shrinking, Felda is unlikely to be able to meet its debt obligations without the government's assistance. It recorded a loss of RM4.6bil in earnings before interest and tax in 2017."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/what-jokowis-second-term-in-indonesia-means-for-the-economy/,What Jokowi's second term in Indonesia means for the economy,Economy,"Thursday, 18 Apr 2019",2:00 PM MYT,"JAKARTA: With Indonesian President Joko Widodo on course to win a second term as leader, the political uncertainty that’s weighed on the economy this year will be lifted.

Unofficial counts from Wednesday’s election shows Jokowi -- as the president is known -- defeating Prabowo Subianto for a second time by a comfortable margin. 

If that’s confirmed by the official results due in May, it gives Jokowi another five years to build on his solid performance: the economy is set to grow more than 5 percent this year, inflation is under control and the currency has stabilised after last year’s sell-off.

Here’s a look at what the result means for economic policy:

What were Jokowi’s main policy pledges?

The president wants to speed up infrastructure spending in Indonesia, especially on urban and digital projects, to boost economic growth. 

He’s also promised to reduce poverty, keep prices low and improve tax revenue. The government has already embarked on a $350 billion infrastructure drive, the biggest in the nation’s history, but needs to do more to ease bottlenecks, particularly in transport and electricity. 

He’s also expected to spend more on education and training in order to create 100 million jobs in the next five years to provide work for the growing number of millennials entering the labor market each year.

What does it mean for the economic outlook?

The government is forecasting growth of 5.3 percent this year and as much as 5.5 percent in 2020, with downside risks coming from slower global growth and unresolved trade tensions between the U.S. and China. 

Unlike other export-heavy economies in Southeast Asia like Malaysia and Thailand, Indonesia is more reliant on domestic sources of growth, such as consumer spending. 

Subdued inflation and a stable currency may help spur household sentiment and expenditure, which is already getting a boost from Jokowi’s social welfare spending and fuel subsidies. 

A key focus area will also be on narrowing the current-account deficit, cited as a key risk for the rupiah. The government imposed import curbs to reduce overseas demand, as well as promote the use of biofuels to cut down on crude imports.

How does it affect fiscal policy?

Much will depend on whether Jokowi chooses to retain his finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati. She was successful in narrowing the budget gap to 1.76 percent of GDP last year, well below the 3 percent ceiling, and improve tax compliance. 

However, Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio remains low at about 12 percent. Jokowi has pledged to borrow only to finance infrastructure projects, and to reduce the reliance on foreign ownership of government bonds.

The jump in oil prices this year will help boost government coffers, but if Jokowi keeps fuel subsidies in place, rising crude will put additional strain on the budget.

Will monetary policy change?

Inflation has been subdued, slowing to a decade-low of 2.5 percent in March. The central bank -- which has kept its key interest rate unchanged at 6 percent this year after six hikes in 2018 -- expects inflation to stay inside the 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent target this year.

 Low food prices and fuel caps have helped to keep inflation under control, while the U.S. Federal Reserve’s shift away from rate hikes has fueled a rebound in the currency, giving Bank Indonesia scope to extend its policy pause. 

The central bank has a policy decision next week, and while there have been growing calls for rate cuts, Governor Perry Warjiyo has signaled a more cautious approach given global risks. He took office in May last year, and his term doesn’t expire until May 2023.

What does it mean for the currency?

A Jokowi win removes some of the policy uncertainty that’s kept investors on the sidelines in the run-up to the election. The rupiah may rally against the dollar on Thursday, with offshore forward contracts already gaining on Wednesday as early results pointed to the incumbent’s likely victory.

 The central bank has been proactive in stabilizing the currency after last year’s sell-off and has more than $120 billion in foreign exchange reserves it can use to defend the rupiah. 

It also regularly provides liquidity in times of market stress. To boost confidence in the currency over time, the new administration will need to bring down imports in order to tackle the current account deficit.

What’s next?

The official result will only be announced in May, and, if confirmed, Jokowi will be sworn in for a second term in October. 

Prabowo has threatened to legally challenge his defeat, and investors may remain cautious until the official results are known. Until Jokowi begins his second term in October, expect it to be business as usual for government programs.

 The president is likely to make some changes in his cabinet, with investors keenly watching if he’ll keep Indrawati as finance minister or move her to a different post.

 A former managing director of the World Bank, she is well-respected by the international community. Other key appointments to watch for include ministers of trade, economy, energy and mineral resources. 

The head of the investment board, a cabinet position in Indonesia, is also crucial. - Bloomberg"

The pay-TV operator announced on Thursday its unit Measat Broadcast Network Systems Sdn Bhd (MBNS) had signed the agreement with Measat Global to use the transponders capacity on the Measat-3d satellite.

Concurrently, MBNS had agreed on the early termination of the April 12, 2018 agreement to use the  transponder capacity on the satellite.

Astro said MBNS was leasing 42 transponders on Measat satellites for its required transponder capacity to provide Direct-to-Home (DTH) and Internet access services to its subscribers.

However, the lease for 12 transponders on the M3 satellite and six transponders on the M3a satellites will expire on Feb 22, 2022 and 20 July 2024, respectively. 

Astro said due to the additional transponder capacity to be leased on the M3d satellite, MBNS decided to terminate the M3b 2018 agreement which involves the lease of 6 transponders on the M3b satellite for 12 years up to June 11, 2030 for a total fee of US$22.5mil. 

It pointed out that after the expiry, MBNS will only have the use of transponders on 1 operational satellite i.e. the M3b satellite. 

“The proposed utilisation will allow MBNS to utilise the transponder capacity on the M3d satellite which is expected to be launched in year 2022. This will satisfy MBNS’ business continuity plan requirements so that MBNS will have the use of transponders on at least two operating satellites. 

“In addition, with the improvement in video compression technology, it is expected that the 12 transponders on the M3d satellite will be able to replace the 18 existing transponders on the M3 and M3a satellites. The proposed early termination will allow MBNS to terminate the lease of the six transponders on the M3b satellite which it no longer requires. 

Astro said the MeasatT-3d spacecraft shall consist of Ku-band payload which comprises of 12 Ku-band transponders. 

The Ku-band transponders feature high equivalent isotropic radiated power levels over Malaysia. 

The Malaysia payload of MEASAT-3d Ku-band, as a subject of the M3d Agreement consists of 12 simultaneously operable Ku-band transponders with each channel having a usable bandwidth of 36MHz and travelling wave tube amplifiers power of 150 Watts. 

Each transponder has usable bandwidth of 36 MHz with 4 MHz guard bands. 

Depending on the transponders’ configurations and operational constraints, there will be at least three redundant TWTAs to back up the highly reliable primary units in a flexible ring redundant system. In addition, a redundant receiver is provided to ensure highest spacecraft reliability. 

Furthermore, as the M3d satellite will be co-located with the current MBNS satellites, the satellite dishes of MBNS’ subscribers would not need to be re-positioned, thereby minimising any disruption to MBNS’ DTH services."

Group managing director Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli said the global index provider would not rush in dropping Malaysia from the list and the decision would only be made in September.

“It is only a speculation, but I would say that few things need to be looked at, especially Malaysia’s strong foreign exchange reserves, current account surplus, well-supported oil price, as well as a very low inflation rate, as all of these factors should also be reflecting on the bond yield as well,” he told a press conference after launching the new RHB mobile banking application here today.

He reiterated that the current bond yield does not truly reflect the fundamentals of the Malaysian market.  

“Our bond market is very deep, in fact one of the deepest in Asia and any kind of volatility can easily be absorbed by real money fund in Malaysia. So, I wouldn’t be too worried about the speculation,” he said.

The global index provider has placed Malaysian bonds on the watch list for six months due to concern about market liquidity, which simultaneously raises some concerns that an exclusion could trigger a rating downgrade.

Commenting further on the bearish index-linked counters performance which has worsen, particularly following the recent FTSE Russell’s announcement, Khairussaleh said the banking group believes that the weak performance was a temporary knee-jerk reaction due to the announcement, as well as tracking the trend in the global markets, including the emerging markets.  

“We actually have a positive outlook on the FBM KLCI Index. Of course, at the moment, the weak performance is part of market volatility and part of the effect of what is happening around the world, but we advise customers to look at particular stocks that are worth investing in,” he added.

“We are keen to increase the Malaysian palm oil trade and we have been encouraging our companies to buy more Malaysian palm oil and related products,” said Bai Tian at a media roundtable today.

“I believe the (purchase) number will increase this year. We have been telling Chinese buyers to buy more local palm oil and products,” he added while briefing Malaysian media on the upcoming Belt and Road Summit and the Malaysian Prime Minister’s visit to China.

The envoy said demand is very huge for Malaysian palm oil in China, which has a population of 1.4 billion, as it is of high quality and competitive in pricing.

“I hope this year we will witness more purchase of Malaysian palm oil. We do not impose a glass ceiling to the purchase of Malaysian palm oil and palm oil products,” said Bai Tian.

China is the third biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil in the world, but the largest purchaser of Malaysian palm oil and related products.

The ambassador said China is looking at upstream and downstream cooperation with Malaysian oil palm companies. 

On Monday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia has asked China to buy more palm oil, at the conclusion of the new deal on East Coast Rail Link.

He told reporters: “We are taking advantage of the signing of the ECRL agreement to work out the purchase of palm oil from China, that will happen.”"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/big-corporates-back-crypto-plumbing-despite-currency-caution/,Big corporates back crypto 'plumbing' despite currency caution,Fintech,"Thursday, 18 Apr 2019",4:26 PM MYT,"LONDON: Major finance and tech firms are pouring money into startups building technology to develop the crypto market, even though they’re steering clear of the volatile currencies themselves.

Venture capital investments in crypto and blockchain startups that included funds from corporates have raced to $850 million so far this year, data compiled by PitchBook for Reuters shows. The 13 deals put the flows on track for a second straight annual record.

Such bets, by companies including London Stock Exchange Group and Microsoft Corp, spiked over five-fold to a record $2.4 billion over 117 investments in 2018. This suggests large companies see promise in the nascent technology, even as it struggles for acceptance.

They have mostly given digital coins, including bitcoin, a wide berth, avoiding direct investment because of worries over tightening regulation, frequent security lapses and high volatility.

The lack of mainstream embrace has sown serious doubts over the potential of cryptocurrencies to evolve from speculative tokens to means of payment capable of rivaling fiat money.

Bitcoin slumped by three-quarters last year after nearing a record of $20,000 in its frenzied 2017 bubble. It’s still prone to wild price moves, underscored by a recent 20 percent jump that caused puzzlement among traders and analysts.

And though blockchain has found some use in sectors such as trade finance, its application has been relatively narrow.

Firms are looking at how, and if, blockchain and related technologies can be used in ways that could spark deeper change, said Richard Hay, UK head of fintech at law firm Linklaters.

“There are two dynamics at play,” he said. “We can get something up and running and achieve cost savings, and also look longer term at ways of deploying the technology in more transformative ways.”

Recent examples include a $20 million investment involving the London Stock Exchange and Banco Santander in a London startup whose platform can be used to issue debt on blockchain, the technology that underpins most digital coins.

“BASIC PLUMBING”
The investments span startups from makers of cryptocurrency mining gear and exchanges, the PitchBook data to April 8 shows.

One key driver is a growing expectation that the “tokenisation” of assets from stocks to oil - essentially digitizing them and allowing them to be traded on blockchain - will upend markets, lawyers and consultants working with fintech firms said.

“People are really enamored by tokenisation - the ability to produce coins or other forms of value - so that’s where we see all of the action at the moment,” said Anton Ruddenklau, global co-head of fintech at KPMG.

“They are investing as a technological hedge as much as anything.”

Bets involving corporate venture capital are usually small, the data shows. Deals this year had a median value of $6.5 million, a notch below the $8 million of last year.

Others are much bigger.

Bakkt, a cryptocurrency trading platform founded last year by New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, raised in December over $180 million from investors including M12, Microsoft’s venture capital arm.

The rush of corporate venture money comes as traditional venture capital (VC) investments also pour into the sector. Last year 617 deals totaled a record $5.6 billion worldwide, the data shows, as venture capitalists assess how the technologies will impact the online economy.

“There is a huge experimentation in effectively the basic plumbing for a native economic layer to the web,” said Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, a fund that has led investment in around eight blockchain-related projects.

But with that experimentation has come examples of failure.

In December, cryptocurrency project Basis said it would shut down and return funds to its backers including Google owner Alphabet’s venture arm GV and Bain Capital Ventures because of concerns over regulation.

Cryptocurrency miners and exchanges make up the four biggest VC-backed firms by valuation, according to the PitchBook data.

Some have struggled amid the slump in bitcoin prices. The $12 billion-valued Bitmain Technologies, for example, last month shelved a planned initial public offering in Hong Kong.

Others have fared better. San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase, valued at $8 billion, saw non-U.S. revenue grow 20 percent last year to 153 million euros ($173 million), a filing to Britain’s corporate registry last week showed.

The exchange’s UK arm, which books the firm’s non-U.S. revenue, accounts for almost a third of the firm’s overall revenue, said Coinbase UK chief executive Zeeshan Feroz.

That suggests, according to Reuters calculations, worldwide revenue of around $520 million last year - a rare glimpse into the financial health of a cryptocurrency exchange.

Over the past decade, liquidity has risen before results, then dropped on the day itself as volatility increases and quants stay away, according to calculations from the US bank. 
In other words, volumes were spurred by anticipation of corporate reports, and volatility fanned by reaction to them.

""The five days preceding the earnings day offer the most attractive days to access liquidity in a single stock,” Goldman strategists led by John Marshall wrote in a note. ""Pre-position for earnings moves, but wait until four to six days after to exit.”

The study comes as Goldman has seen an improvement in broad liquidity metrics over the last three months after declines to multi-year lows at the end of 2018. 
In a research note in December, strategists led by Marshall and Rocky Fishman said the divergence between 2018’s heightened equity volatility and relative economic stability can be explained in large part by illiquidity.

It’s a fear often expressed by JPMorgan Chase & Co, re-stating this month that liquidity and volatility can be connected in a feedback loop that exaggerates price moves.

Marshall’s April note also offered 25 ""most differentiated” ideas for the next three months of earnings, where Goldman’s analysts are most out of consensus for the coming quarter and expect shares to move. 
Firms such as Amazon.com Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Amgen Inc and Marriott International Inc make the list of those with upside to estimates, while Gap Inc and Intel Corp are among those with most downside.

Also, the consumer discretionary sector provides ""usually strong alpha opportunities,” or chances to beat the overall market, because its earnings-day moves have increased recently, the strategists said.

Another big opportunity may lie in the options market, especially given low volatility levels on broad cross-asset metrics.

""The average implied earnings day move ahead of this earnings season is +/-4.1%, its lowest level on record,” the strategists wrote. 
""We see options as unusually attractive given the recent rise in earnings-day volatility. We see low implied moves as evidence that there is limited fear priced into stocks.”"

AirAsia Group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said the disposal would provide the low-cost carrier with more cash at its disposal.
“Selling our aircraft monetises all our aircraft at high prices and avoids residual risk and allows us to return cash to shareholders and invest in our new digital business,” he said via Twitter following the company’s EGM yesterday.
On Dec 24, 2018, AirAsia announced that it was disposing of 25 aircraft to Castlelake LP in a deal worth US$768mil (RM3.22bil).
Castlelake LP will also purchase four new aircraft that will be delivered to AirAsia in 2019. The 29 planes – Airbus’ A320-200ceo and A320neo – will be leased back to AirAsia.
Later that month, AirAsia’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Asia Aviation Capital Ltd (AACL), entered into a share purchase agreement with Castlelake’s indirect entities for the disposal of its entire equity interest in Merah Aviation Asset Holding Ltd – which owns the aircraft.
The proposed disposal is expected to reduce AirAsia’s gross gearing ratio from 0.53 times to 0.24 times.
Separately, Fernandes said the impact of the MFRS 16 accounting standard on AirAsia is “not very material.”
“Even with that standard and if you use profit and loss for analysis, the impact of the new standard MFRS 16 is about RM35mil a year,” he said via Twitter. 
The MFRS 16 is a new accounting standard for leases that took effect this year. 
CGSCIMB in a report earlier this month said the new accounting standard would result in higher gearing levels for AirAsia.
The research house noted that AirAsia had sold 79 aircraft to lessor BBAM Ltd Partnership in 2018 and is expected to sell a further 25 planes to lessor Castlelake LP by the third quarter of this year.
Together with the other existing operating lease aircraft, CGSCIMB said AirAsia is expected to capitalise RM11.8bil worth of borrowings related to the operating leases in  2019, effectively bringing back to the balance sheet what had previously been off-balance sheet.
“The impact would be to raise reported gross gearing of 19% in 2018 to 198% on a pro forma basis after MFRS 16.
“The overall impact to profit and loss earnings from the above sale and leasebacks is negative because AirAsia would have to pay for the lessors’ profit margin as well as provide for a higher level of maintenance charges based on lessors’ conditions for lease returns, which tend to be strict. 
“The net result would be a squeeze on AirAsia’s profit margins.”
Meanwhile, AllianceDBS Research said AirAsia’s outlook remains steady as market leader in the industry with 41.7% market share.
“Expansion plans are under way with 18 new aircraft for 2019. Available seat kilometres (ASK) is expected to grow at 9.8% and revenue passenger kilometres at 10.1% backed by load factors of 84.7%. Subdued fuel prices would help support earnings,” it said."

According to the Nikkei report, Leong Hup has managed to secure funding commitment from 10 cornerstone investors including the likes of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), ahead of its initial public offering (IPO) to raise up to US$400mil (RM1.65bil).
It said the current valuation was “well-received” by the cornerstone investors, which also included insurer AIA Group and prominent investor Chua Ma Yu.
Quoting sources, the report said Leong Hup is expected to launch its prospectus as early as next week, and list on the stock exchange next month.
According to an analyst with a local brokerage, a 15 times valuation for Leong Hup was “reasonable and quite fair”.
Early last year, a Reuters report, quoting sources, said Leong Hup was targeting to raise proceeds of US$600mil (RM2.5bil) from the IPO, which translated to a valuation of up to 30 times.
Leong Hup, together with QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chain of restaurants in Malaysia, were among the highly anticipated IPOs this year after a drought of IPOs in the country last year.
According to recent media reports, however, QSR Brands has decided to shelve its planned IPO indefinitely.
Citing sources, Reuters reported earlier this month that QSR had shelved plans for an IPO that could have raised as much as US$500mil as potential investors viewed its valuations as too high. 
Leong Hup is among the largest fully integrated producers of poultry, eggs and livestock feeds in South-East Asia.
The group operates in an industry with significant barriers to entry, such as industry know-how and regulatory restrictions, providing it with a sustained competitive advantage.
Its profit after tax and minority interests saw a two-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.4% between 2015 and 2017, while the CAGR for revenue during the period at 8%. 
It is the biggest producer of day-old-chicks (DOC) – or newly-hatched chicks – in Malaysia and among the top three producers of DOC in Indonesia and Vietnam.
According to its website, the group’s operations span across Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines, encompassing feedmill manufacturing and marketing and the integrated poultry supply chain – from breeding and rearing of grandparent stock, parent stock and DOC through to contract farming, slaughtering, food processing as well as supply of table eggs."

In the event of a downgrade, Malaysia will be removed from the WGBI, stated FTSE Russell.The index provider’s move to review Malaysian government bonds’ participation in the WGBI came a week after Norway’s US$1 trillion sovereign wealth fund was told to cut emerging-market government and corporate bonds, which include Malaysia.Investors were alarmed that Malaysia’s potential exclusion from the WGBI would mean reversal of funds out of the domestic bond market. This would have a major impact on the ringgit and local debt instruments. According to Maybank Kim Eng Research, the risk of dropping Malaysian bonds from the WGBI seemed “more likely than not”, unless fundamental changes are made to improve Malaysia’s market accessibility level.It estimated that Malaysia faced a total capital outflow risk of US$6bil to US$8bil (RM24bil to RM33bil), if the country is removed from the WGBI.“If FTSE Russell decides to remove Malaysia from the WGBI, foreign selling will likely concentrate on the Malaysian Government Securities (MGS), as currently the WGBI index excludes the Government Investment Issues (GII), although the GII curve will inevitably be affected if foreign selloffs weigh on the MGS curve.“Malaysia’s exit from the WGBI is not conclusive but active funds may offload some positions in advance. Actual removal from the index would result in additional outflows, especially from passive funds, and likely further cheapening of the MGS curve,” said the research house in a note.The weakening of ringgit and the news flow related to the potential WGBI exclusion took a toll on the Malaysian equity market, pushing the FBM KLCI to its lowest level since 2016.The benchmark index closed at 1,620.90 points, lower by 0.53%, or 8.56 points, yesterday. Year-to-date, the index is down 4.12%, making it the worst performer among the key Asian markets.Market breadth was overwhelmingly negative, with 661 decliners and 208 advancers. A total of 365 counters remain unchanged.VCAP Asset Managers Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Taufiq Iskandar Jamingan said the the reasons behind FTSE Russell’s move to put Malaysia on the watch list is unknown.“However, one may point to the liquidity of the market as one of the causes. In addition, despite several shenanigans and incidents of failed governance uncovered recently, the ratings are yet to be affected, raising questions on the state of our fiscal position.“The market has yet to be presented with concrete plans to diversify and expand the country’s revenue base.“The effects could be extended to the currency market and the ringgit may experience downward pressure in the short term. As for equity market, investors may seek refuge in yield and value plays as the outflow of  foreign funds continues,” he told StarBiz.On the bond market, AmBank Group chief economist Anthony Dass said that room for further consolidation remained until a final decision is made by FTSE Russell in six months.He also said that MGS yields rose by three to 14 basis points (bps) across the board yesterday, as a result of the FTSE Russell announcement.The 3-, 5-, 7-  and 10-year MGS yields increased by 3.5 bps, 9.5 bps, 13.5 bps and 5 bps to 3.46%, 3.715%, 3.835% and 3.875%, respectively, he said“Should there be a full withdrawal, the impact on our yields will be around 28 to 32 basis points. Our assessment showed that for every RM1bil outflow in MGS, the impact on the yield is around 1 basis point,” said Dass.In an e-mail reply to StarBiz, RAM Ratings said the FTSE Russell announcement sparked a knee-jerk reaction as the benchmark 10-year MGS yield jumped four basis points to 3.81% on the April 16, from 3.77% the previous day.“Given how investors are sensitive to these announcements, it is perhaps not a surprising development that investors have started to reposition their funds on account of this.“If Malaysia is excluded after the review period come September, the impact could be cushioned by the fact that portfolio rebalancing will be staggered across time rather than a one-off sell-down,” said RAM Ratings."

All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session in negative territory, with the S&P 500 remaining just within a percent below its record high reached in September.

The healthcare sector saw its biggest percentage drop in four months, falling 2.9% on regulatory worries.

UnitedHealth Group Inc, Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Abbott Laboratories all closed down between 1.9% and 4.7%, and were among the biggest drags on the broader S&P 500.

""The way the CEOs of these companies are going on offense against the discussions in Congress, it starts a momentum of its own.""

Investors ""would rather invest in sectors that aren't going through such a big controversy.""

The sector's drop dampened generally encouraging earnings reports.

Morgan Stanley rose 2.6% after beating analyst estimates due to cost-cutting and growth in its wealth management segment.

United Continental Holdings Inc jumped 4.7% following Tuesday's after-market earnings report, where the airline bested consensus estimates and held its 2019 profit target firm, even as Boeing Co's 737 MAX jets remain grounded.

Robust business jet demand drove Textron Inc's earnings beat, driving its stock up 4.0%.

PepsiCo Inc reported better-than-expected first-quarter sales on strong North American demand. The packaged food company's shares rose 3.8%.

With reporting season in high gear, analysts now expect Jan-March S&P 500 profits to have dropped 1.8% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv data, which would mark the first earnings decline since 2016.

Of the 54 S&P 500 companies that have posted thus far, 79.6% have beaten consensus, compared with the 65% average beat rate going back to 1994.

The news boosted other chipmakers, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index advancing 1.6%.

On the economic front, the U.S. trade deficit dropped to an eight-month low in February due to a 20.2% plunge in imports from China.

China, meanwhile, saw its first-quarter GDP grow at a better-than-expected 6.4% annual rate.

Melbourne-based National Australia Bank now estimates a A$325 million hit to cash earnings for the first half of this year as a result of the increased provisions.

""We are putting things right where we have treated our customers poorly and making sure that they are compensated more quickly,"" NAB's Chief Executive Officer, Philip Chronican said in a statement.

Chronican said there were currently around 350 employees dedicated to remediating customers, and that is expected to rise to around 500.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) rebuked the biggest banks and financial services firms in March for delays in fixing internal systems that resulted in customers paying fees for services they had not received, in the wake of an inquiry into financial sector wrongdoing.

NAB's move follows other major lenders who have taken similar steps to refurbish wronged customers.

Australia's Westpac Banking Corp, one of the ""Big Four"" lenders in Australia, in March warned that its first-half cash earnings would fall about A$260 million on account of provisions for customer refunds.

Similarly, Commonwealth Bank of Australia also announced similar refund measures last year. - Reuters"

In an impromptu news conference at the Rio de Janeiro headquarters of Petrobras, as the company is known, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco announced a diesel price hike of 10 cents per liter and said Petrobras has complete control over its pricing strategy.

Speaking only minutes before at an event in Sao Paulo, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia said Petrobras was looking at selling off assets such as deepwater pipelines and Petrobras Distribuidora SA, which includes a gas station chain stretching across the country.

The comments come as executives scramble to contain the fallout from the company's cancellation on Friday of a diesel price hike at the behest of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, stirring fears of political interference and tanking Petrobras shares.

While Bolsonaro´s government has promised a hands-off approach to Petrobras, investors are wary of a return to policies enacted under past administrations, in which the company was forced to sell fuel at a discount to international rates.

On Tuesday, Bolsonaro´s spokesman and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes sought to characterize the canceled price hike as a one-time error that would not be repeated.

According to an information posted on Petrobras' website, the company increased the price of diesel at refineries by 4.7 percent after canceling a 5.7 percent increase on Friday.

Castello Branco said Petrobras ""rigorously"" keeps its prices in line with international rates and has no plans to change its policy of adjusting fuel prices every 15 days.

PIPES AND PUMPS

Petrobras is analyzing the best model for selling three offshore natural gas pipelines, Grisolia said, including whether they will be sold individually or in a package.

Grisolia said the company would ""probably"" reduce its stake in Petrobras Distribuidora to below 50 percent from the current 71 percent, effectively privatizing the unit through a secondary share offering.

Investors have cheered Petrobras' recent push to cut debt and refocus on oil exploration and production via an aggressive divestment program.

Reuters reported earlier this month that Petrobras was preparing to sell three more gas pipelines after successfully selling its larger TAG unit to France's Engie for $8.6 billion.

Reuters reported on Tuesday the company had hired nine banks to manage Petrobras Distribuidora's share offering. - Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/no-brexit-more-likely-than-a-disorderly-one-say-economists/,"No Brexit more likely than a disorderly one, say economists",Economy,"Thursday, 18 Apr 2019",8:33 AM MYT,"LONDON: The chances that Brexit will be cancelled are now greater than the chances Britain will leave the European Union without a deal, according to economists in a Reuters poll, who again pushed back their expectations for when the Bank of England will raise interest rates.

Last week, the EU delayed Brexit until the end of October, averting for now the risk of an abrupt British departure, which investors and policymakers fear would hurt both economies.

In the latest monthly Reuters survey, taken April 12-17, the median probability Britain and the EU will part ways in a disorderly fashion - where no deal is agreed - held steady at the 15 percent given in March, the lowest since Reuters began asking in July 2017.

Only one of 51 respondents gave a value over 50 percent.

""Apart from the fact that no-deal Brexit is now less likely, the path ahead is as unclear as ever. A deal (and likely a softer Brexit) still seems more likely than not,"" BNP Paribas economists said. ""But we are sceptical that this will happen any time soon.""

That chimed with the views of most economists polled, who said the two sides would settle eventually on a free-trade deal - as they have in all Reuters polls since late 2016.

Britain being a member of the European Economic Area, paying into the EU budget to maintain access to the EU's single market, was again in second place.

But the third and fourth spots flipped from last month, so leaving without an agreement and trading under World Trade Organization rules fell to least likely. Brexit's being cancelled reclaimed third place, a ranking it has only held once before.

Looking at a like-for-like comparison of contributors to this and March's poll showed the same change in views. HOLD IT None of the 75 economists polled expect Bank Rate to be moved from 0.75 percent when the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee announces its decision next month. The MPC will publish its quarterly update of economic forecasts the same day.

""Without Brexit uncertainty, the Bank of England might have considered raising interest rates at the May 2 inflation report meeting. With the country still in limbo politically, this is highly unlikely,"" said Elizabeth Martins at HSBC.

Medians suggest the first rate increase of 25 basis points will come early next year, one calendar quarter later than was forecast a month ago. Bank Rate will then stay at 1.00 percent throughout 2020, the poll predicted.

Britain's economy dodged the expected post-Brexit referendum recession, but growth has slowed as uncertainty holds back investment.

UK wage growth hit a decade high in the three months to the end of February, but that was mainly driven by companies taking on workers - who can be fired relatively easily if the economy slows - rather than committing to longer-term investments.

The economy is predicted to grow a modest 0.2 to 0.4 percent per quarter through to the end of next year, similar to forecasts for the euro zone.

Those median forecasts for Britain were weaker than last month's. But the chance of a recession in the coming year held steady at the 25 percent given in March. They fell to 25 percent within the next two years from 30 percent.

Inflation held just below the BoE's 2 percent target at 1.9 percent last month, official figures showed on Wednesday. Thursday's poll said it would be at or around the Bank's target through to the end of next year.

""While a few one-off factors might see headline UK inflation rebound a touch in the short-term, the overall outlook is benign and we do not expect a rate hike from the Bank of England this year,"" said James Smith at ING. - Reuters"

""We believe PPB’s strong financial position and prudent debt management will help the group to continue to expand and grow its core businesses locally and regionally,"" the research house said in a note.

For 2019-21E, Affin Hwang expects PPB's core net profit to increase 2% to 8% year-on-year to RM1.16bil to RM1.3bil on the back of improving earnings from its core divisions.

These core divisions include grains & agribusiness, film exhibition & distribution, environmental engineering & utilities as well as its associate Wilmar.

According to Affin Hwang, PPB's bottomline is highly dependent on its 18.5% stake in Wilmar International, which contributes to 65% to 75% of its pre-tax profit.

The group is expected to benefit from rising disposable incomes in Malaysia, which could potentially lead to growth in food consumption and an increase in leisure spending, which should help to increase revenue contribution to PPB's core businesses.

Affin Hwang believes PPB is a well-established and diversified conglomerate in Malaysia. 

""In our view, the typical strong attributes of a consumer staple stock, stable but decent EPS growth, are found in PPB, which should continue to benefit from favourable demographics.

""In our view, PPB is a well-run company, with a good profit track record and direct exposure to one of the leading global agricultural business through its 18.5% stake in Wilmar,"" said Affin Hwang."

The research house said on Thursday this incorporates a 25% holding company discount to its sum-of-parts-based fair value of RM5.14 a share. 

“This implies an FY19F EV/EBITDA of five times, two standard deviation below its two-year average of seven times,” it said.  

AmInvest Research also said Axiata has received a letter from Nepal’s Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) confirming that the outstanding capital gains tax (CGT) of NPR39bil (RM1.5bil) should be deposited by April 22, 2019.

Recall that Nepal’s Supreme Court has ordered that the CGT arising from the sale of an 80% equity stake in Ncell for US$1.4bil by TeliaSonera Norway Nepal Holdings in December 2015 should be borne by Ncell and the buyer Axiata, following a public interest litigation filed by a group of Nepali nationals. 
 
According to the Himalayan Times, the CGT payable is NPR62.6bil, of which Axiata has already paid instalments of NPR23.3bil, including late interest charges.
  
“As such, the final balance CGT payable will be lower by NPR6bil (RM223mil) vs our earlier assumption of NPR45bil (RM1.7bil) which we had included in our SOP. 

“However, revising the assumption does not substantively change our SOP. The letter does not indicate that Axiata needs to pay the entire NPR63bil first before deducting the instalments upon a formal application, as earlier reported by the media. 

“Hence, we estimate that this could raise Axiata’s FY19F net debt/EBITDA from 1.6 times to only 1.7 times, vs. our earlier estimate of 1.8 times,” it said. 

AmInvest Research said if the group were to make a provision this year, Axiata’s FY19F net profit of RM1.3bil could reverse to a loss of RM200mil. 
 
“While we maintain the view that the court verdict is unreasonable, Axiata’s regulatory risk profile has worsened as the group may not have any further legal recourse except pursue an uncertain claim from Telia.
 
“Additionally, distribution of dividends and any sale of Ncell shares should not be granted until the tax obligation is satisfied. 

“Even though Axiata currently trades at a bargain FY19F EV/EBITDA of five times vs. Maxis’ 12 times, the group’s deteriorating overseas risk profile amid intense mobile completion both locally and regionally could limit any medium-term share price upside. 
 
“Additionally, the government’s intention to reduce Khazanah Nasional’s holdings in GLC-linked companies currently casts shadows of a share overhang,” it said."

Jet Airways, once India's largest private airline, on Wednesday evening halted all flight operations indefinitely after lenders led by State Bank of India declined to extend more funds to keep it going. Jet shares plunged to the lowest since April 2009 in early trade on Thursday.

The carrier, saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of bank debt, has been teetering for weeks after failing to receive a stop-gap loan of about $217 million from its lenders, as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.

Investors have doubts over whether a successful deal can be completed, said Shukor Yusof, the head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. ""Jet Airways' value is dwindling with each passing day,"" he added.

At its peak, Jet operated over 120 planes and well over 600 daily flights. The airline, which has roughly 16,000 employees, has in recent weeks been forced to cancel hundreds of flights and to halt all flights out of India as funds dried up.

""The lenders after due deliberations decided that the best way forward for the survival of Jet Airways is to get the binding bids from potential investors who have expressed EOI and have been issued bid documents on 16th April,"" the lenders said on Thursday, referring to expressions of interest.

""Lenders are reasonably hopeful that the bid process is likely to be successful in determining fair value of the enterprise in a transparent manner.""

CNBC-TV18 reported on Tuesday that Jet's lenders were set to invite binding bids from four shortlisted suitors that include private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, Indian wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), and Etihad Airways, which already owns a minority stake in Jet.

Etihad did not respond to a request for comment outside usual business hours.

The crisis at Jet, long the biggest operator in Mumbai, has opened a window of opportunity for other airlines to fill a gap in supply. Budget carriers SpiceJet Ltd and IndiGo are already rushing to add planes.

SpiceJet shares surged 15 percent to the highest since February 2018 early on Thursday, while shares in IndiGo's parent InterGlobe Aviation Ltd rose by 3 percent.

India's Ministry of Aviation said on Wednesday evening that meetings with airports and airlines would be held on Thursday.

""We are assisting airlines and airports to bring in capacity rapidly to ensure that fares remain stable and competitive,"" the ministry said on its Twitter account. - Reuters"

Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is doing its best to make nice with one of its biggest customers. With the ink barely dry on the takeover of 70 percent of the country’s chemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. and the issuance of its first-ever corporate bond, Aramco is looking to buy a stake in the world’s biggest oil refinery.

Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. is seeking to sell as much as a quarter of its refining business for at least $10 billion and is entertaining offers from Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News this week.

That represents quite a prize. Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery is about twice the size of the biggest U.S. plant, Aramco-owned Port Arthur, and is so massive that maintenance work occasionally skews India’s entire trade balance.

Trade is also the reason India should be cautious of Aramco’s embrace. The country has a dangerous addiction to imported crude, and it should be wary of getting too cozy with its dealer.

For more than a century, the rise of major economic powers has been fueled by petroleum. The U.S. is both the world’s biggest oil consumer and its biggest producer. The Soviet Union was built on its oilfields in the Caucasus and Siberia. While China has overtaken America as the biggest oil importer, it’s also the biggest producer outside the Middle East after the U.S., Russia and Canada. 

India is different. The U.S. produces about 1.8 metric tons of oil a year per capita and even China manages 138 kilograms. 

India “ at a far earlier stage of development than either country"" ekes out just 30 kilograms. Production peaked all the way back in 2010, and shows no sign of recovery. 

Industrialisation is an energy-intensive process. If India’s development is going to be powered by crude oil, it’s going to be buying a whole lot more from Aramco and its ilk.

Such a future would pose some profound risks. Balance of payments crises are a recurring danger for emerging economies, and even at its current stage of development oil typically accounts for about a quarter of India’s imports. If prices spike higher â“ as, inevitably, they will from time to time â“ that’s good news for Riyadh, but potentially devastating for New Delhi.

When crude is averaging $85 a barrel â“ roughly the level at which Saudi Arabia can balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund â“ oil imports would reduce India’s gross domestic product by about 3.6 percentage points, according to a study this year by the Reserve Bank of India. 

Higher prices will also push up inflation and weaken the government’s fiscal position, the authors found.

At present, that dynamic is somewhat mitigated by the fact that about a third of India’s oil imports are re-exported as petroleum products, giving the country a natural hedge against rising prices. 

Jamnagar, for instance, produces almost exclusively for export, meaning that it probably makes a modestly positive contribution to the trade balance since oil products are more valuable than the crude they’re made from.

Should domestic consumption grow faster than export refinery capacity, though, India’s oil dependence will start taking a deeper bite out of its current account.

 In a worst-case scenario, a spike in oil prices could drive the country toward a balance of payments crisis like the one it suffered in 1991, when a splurge on oil imports over the previous decade resulted in New Delhi pledging its gold reserves as security for bailouts from multilateral lenders.

India is aware that its dependence on imported crude risks constraining growth. The government wants 30 percent of new cars and two-wheelers to be electric by 2030 and is already  home to more than 1.5 million electric rickshaws. 

It’s also adjusted tax policies to encourage that transition. In a country at grave risk from climate change, whose cities are already choking on vehicle smog, reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels is more than just an issue for the current account.

That goal isn’t an unrealistic one given the rock-bottom local cost of wind and solar. 

Still, no country has managed a low-carbon industrialization on this scale before, so it won’t be easy â“ and Saudi Arabia will be hoping it proves all but impossible. 

By promising to buy a chunk of Reliance and help fund a new $44 billion Jamnagar-sized refinery in western India, Aramco is counting on the country being unable to kick its self-destructive oil habit. 

Indians should hope that it’s wrong. - Bloomberg"

Two separate class-action complaints against Lyft, as well as its officers and directors and underwriters, were filed Wednesday in state court in the company’s hometown, San Francisco.

Since going public March 28, Lyft has declined 17 percent to $59.51. That compares with the offering price of $72. 

The stock sold off sharply amid larger rival Uber Technologies Inc.’s filing for an initial public offering last week, as investors will soon have another option to bet on the potential of ride-sharing and gig-economy.

The investors claim Lyft was exaggerating in its prospectus when it said its U.S. market share was 39 percent.

 In both suits, the plaintiffs also dinged the company for failing to tell investors that it was about to recall more than a 1,000 of the bikes in its ride-share programme.

That deal saw orders for three times the debt on sale.“New jobs in Ireland created by the UK’s coming exit from the European Union “means those coming from abroad are competing with domestic tenants,” McGrath said, citing banks including Barclays Plc that are hiring in the Irish capital. That means loans backed by high-end properties leased to financial professionals will be “more prevalent in the next deal” Dilosk arranges, McGrath said.Dilosk has become the biggest player in Ireland’s buy-to-let sector, which lent a combined €272mil to landlords last year, up from €214mil in 2016, according to figures from Ireland’s Banking & Payments Federation.The country’s banks have been “tepid” in getting involved after buy-to-let was among the worst hit sectors when a speculative property boom turned to bust, according to alternative-credit analysts Integer Advisors.Dilosk’s €215mil mortgage-backed deal last week saw €700mil of demand for five tranches of notes, Dilosk said in a statement on Monday.

The unanswered question is when that will happen.
Auto executives attending this year’s show in Shanghai gave a range of estimates from this month to the second half of this year. As a point of reference, the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said last week that sales could rebound in July or August after the effects of government tax breaks trickle down to consumer spending -- but overall growth likely would be flat this year.
The tax reductions could be big. China announced plans to cut a total of two trillion yuan (US$298bil) in duties and fees, including value-added taxes, this year to help bolster the world’s second largest economy.
Still, not everyone is convinced that the stimulus will be enough to keep all carmakers competitive.
“I’m not optimistic about the overly fragmented and capital-intensive industry business model,” said Bill Russo, chief executive officer of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd. “The headwinds are still there.”
While automakers showed off some exciting new models at the Shanghai show, consumers likely will remain cautious until there is some resolution to the US-China trade negotiations and clarity on the direction of the overall economy, said Steve Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Yesterday, China said gross domestic product rose 6.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, exceeding economist estimates. Bloomberg
Global sales chief Juergen Stackmann said the carmaker saw demand in China pick up in April, though full-year sales may be little changed from 2018. It’s inevitable that China’s growth will moderate, but the company expects the market to continue growing in coming years, Stackmann said.
A day earlier, chief executive officer Herbert Diess said he’s more optimistic about the second half of the year. The world’s biggest carmaker was “pleased” it boosted its share in China by about 1 %.
> BMW AG
Chief financial officer Nicolas Peter forecast China sales to increase between 5% and 10% this year, but he said the overall auto market likely will be flat.
> McLaren Automotive
CEO Michael Flewitt told Bloomberg Television that the maker of ultra-high-end sports cars expects sales to be flat this year at 300 units.

In a statement yesterday, HSS said the increased attention to the Asean region is in light of the significant public investments in large-scale transportation infrastructure, private sector projects and overall economic development.
“Besides this, the group is also looking to venture into recurring income and long-term based contracts, with a focus towards the power sector, namely renewable energy sources such as solar, biogas and biomass.
“This is in response to the target set by the Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Ministry to increase the country’s renewable energy levels to 20% by 2030, from 2% currently,” it said.
In line with these endeavours, HSS Engineers has proposed a revision in the utilisation of the remaining RM24mil in initial public offering (IPO) proceeds, with proceeds previously earmarked for expansion into India to now also include the Asean region, and revised upwards to RM6mil from RM5mil previously.
“Furthermore, the group proposed RM12mil of the IPO proceeds to be reallocated from investment into facility management and Building Information Modelling to venture into recurring income and long term-based contracts, with a focus on the power sector,” it said.
Executive vice-chairman Tan Sri Kunasingam V. Sittampalam said HSS Engineers plans to leverage on its engineering consulting expertise to take part in this boom.
“The group has already made inroads into Indonesia with the completion of three projects for PT Adaro Energy Tbk prior, and are looking for further opportunities in the country and actively tendering for infrastructure projects in the Philippines to undertake similar works,” he said.
HSS Engineers foresees a strong increase in demand for renewable energy in Malaysia, where current levels are still far off the government target.
“We will enter the renewable power industry by targeting long-term contracts, which will be able to provide the group with a stable revenue base,” he added. — Bernama"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/sapura-energy-needs-time-to-return-to-the-black/,Sapura Energy needs time to return to the black,Markets,"Thursday, 18 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Sapura Energy Bhd  may need more time to return to the black despite recent contract wins. 
CIMB Equities Research, which is  retaining its “hold” call for the oil and gas stock, said Sapura Energy announced several contracts on April 12 with more likely to follow as it is in the process of bidding for many more contracts. 
“The key is how profitable the contracts will be, given that Sapura Energy has been under pressure to build its order book and may have bid competitively,” it said in its report yesterday. 
The research house has an unchanged sum-of-parts based target price of 37 sen on the stock. 
To recap, the company secured RM1.28bil in new contracts, of which the research house estimates RM400mil are in new drilling contracts, and RM900mil in new engineering and construction (E&C) contracts. 
Sapura Energy had earlier disclosed that it had a RM17.2bil order book as at Jan 31, 2019, so the new wins will raise the proforma Jan 31 order book to RM18.5bil, or RM18.6bil factoring in another drilling contract which had not yet been announced by the company but already reflected in Riglogix’s database. 
“We had factored in RM4.7bil in E&C revenue for FY1/20F, against RM4.6bil in contracts won to-date.
“Our revenue target may be exceeded since we are still in the early part of the financial year, but we are more concerned about how profitable these contracts will be,” CIMB Research noted
Sapura Energy’s E&C arm delivered an estimated EBITDA margin of only 1% in FY19, or 5.6% if excluding a RM170m in cost overruns from a domestic onshore project, which compares unfavourably to FY18’s EBITDA margin of c.10% and FY17’s c.13%. 
For E&C contracts to be executed in FY20F, CIMB Research factored in an EBITDA margin of 5%, which it believes is reasonable, albeit tight. 
“The risks to Sapura Energy’s E&C earnings remains high, given that the expected thin margins leave little room for error in execution. 
“We have assumed Sapura Energy to deliver E&C revenue of RM5bil and an EBITDA margin of 10% for FY21F, assuming that global E&C asset utilisation rates improve following an expected increase in offshore capex,” it said.According to the research firm, Sapura Energy is bidding for E&C work in Qatar’s North Field, India’s Heera field, Saudi Arabia’s Marjan and Zuluf fields, Mozambique’s Mamba field, pipeline installation work in Greece and India, among many others, as reported by Upstream. 
New contracts for Sapura Energy’s tender drilling rigs (TDR) SAPE announced two new contracts for the T-9 tender barge and the Berani semi-tender worth US$100mil. Another contract for the T-18 worth US$22mil was reported by Riglogix but yet to be announced by Sapura Energy. 
“Based on contracts secured to date, the TDR fleet as a whole is poised to deliver 41% utilisation rate in FY20F, which should rise once more drilling work is secured, to our forecast of 46%. 
“But we note that there are big differences between the shallow-water tender barge fleet which has secured contracts for 24% utilisation, versus the deep-water-capable semi-tender fleet with 61% utilisation for FY20 forecast. 
“We expect this to persist, as tender barges compete with more flexible and more competitively priced jack-up rigs in South-East Asia. 
“As such, for the forecast period, we lower our utilisation assumption for tender barges from 35% to 30%, and raise our utilisation assumption for semi-tenders from 60% to 65%,” CIMB Research pointed out."

“However, all present shareholders, some of whom came all the way from Sabah and Sarawak, insisted on continuing the EGM, having been advised they have the legal right to proceed and voted, and appointed Shirley Tan Lee Chin to take over as chairman of the EGM,” the statement said.
According to the statement further, 45 shareholders that represented more than 50% (RM240mil) of Seacera’s shares out of a paid-up capital of RM474mil attended the EGM and unanimously voted to reject the resolutions.
The first resolution that was rejected was the proposed settlement of the amount owing by Seacera and two of its subsidiaries, Seacera Ceramics Sdn Bhd and Seacara Properties Sdn Bhd, to certain creditors amounting to about RM31.31mil through the issuance of 149.09 million new shares in Seacera for an issue price of 21 sen per new Seacera share.
Another resolution rejected was the proposed private placement of up to 126.34 million new Seacera shares representing up to about 30% of the existing issued capital of the company that will be subscribed to by potential investors who will be identified later.
The statement also said that the company has a new single-largest shareholder, Datuk William Tan Wei Lian, with about over 16% of total shares.
“The shareholders have voiced up. We are not pleased with the way the management is running the company. We have grounds to believe they are not following proper corporate governance. 
“Hence, we would like to ensure the company is back on track to tap on the company’s full potential,” Tan said in the statement.
Tan is also proposing to remove eight of Seacera’s current 10 directors, to maintain two others and put in six new directors.
The six new directors proposed are Shirley Tan Lee Chin, Rizvi Abdul Halim, Ida Suzaini Abdullah, Clarence Yeow, Chua Eng Chin and Marzuki Hussain.
The new date of the next EGM to put these matters to the vote by shareholders is May 15."

Investors have ranked China’s slowdown and the trade war as the biggest risks facing the faltering global economy.But analysts warn it is too early to call a sustainable turnaround in China, and further policy support is needed to maintain momentum in the world’s second-largest economy. Many had expected a recovery only in the second half of 2019.Beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year to shore up growth, announcing billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending, while Chinese banks lent a record 5.8 trillion yuan (US$865bil) in the first quarter, more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of Switzerland.“We need more evidence to call a full-fledged recovery. Our view for the economy is still cautious,” said Jianwei Xu, senior economist, Greater China at Natixis in Hong Kong.“We think it (the stronger-than-expected data) is somewhat linked to the stimulus, but we can’t attribute it all to it.”Analysts polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to slow slightly to 6.3% in January-March from a year earlier.Government support is gradually having an effect, though the economy still faces pressure, Mao Shengyong, spokesman at the National Bureau of Statistics, cautioned yesterday.Quarterly growth was supported by a sharp jump in industrial production, which surged 8.5% in March on-year, the fastest in over 4½ years. That handily beat analysts’ estimates of 5.9% and 5.3% seen in the first two months of the year.Output of construction materials such as steel and cement, as well as machinery, showed strong gains.Industrial output growth will likely remain steady, with exports expected to keep expanding, Mao said.Exports rebounded more than expected in March, but analysts say the gains could have been due to seasonal factors rather than a rebound in tepid global demand. Long holidays in February likely pushed some production into the following month.The jump in output was also somewhat at odds with trade data last week, which showed imports shrank for the fourth straight month, suggesting domestic demand is still sluggish.“We don’t think the strength in industrial output is sustainable, said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust.“At home, the huge amount of social financing might ease as the central bank is wary of reigniting property market bubbles, while abroad the global economic recovery is expected to slow down,” Nie said, pencilling in more moderate output growth of 6%-6.5% for the rest of the year.Total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, quadrupled in March to 2.86 trillion yuan.The OECD on Tuesday sounded a warning about the dangers of prolonged stimulus, saying China’s support measures will shore up growth this year and next but may undermine its drive to control debt and worsen structural distortions over the medium term.Analysts polled by Reuters expect China’s economic growth to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2% this year, as sluggish demand at home and abroad and the trade war continues to weigh on activity despite support measures.The government is aiming for growth of 6%-6.5%.Yesterday’s data also helped ease some fears of weakening consumer confidence in China. Retail sales rose 8.7% in March, beating estimates of 8.4% and the previous 8.2%.Sales were led by stronger demand for home appliances, furniture and building materials, reflecting a resurgence in China’s residential property market, a key economic growth driver.Real estate investment rose slightly to 11.8% in the first three months, while construction starts jumped in March. Data on Tuesday showed March new home prices quickened for the first time in months.But auto sales extended their decline in March, falling 4.4% on-year. Falls in China’s auto output and sales are expected to ease and return to growth, the statistics bureau’s Mao said.Fixed-asset investment expanded 6.3% in January-to-March from a year earlier, in line with estimates but picking up from the previous period.Local governments will be allowed to issue 2.15 trillion yuan (US$321bil) of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects, a jump of 59% from last year.On a quarterly basis, GDP in the first quarter grew 1.4 percent, as expected, but dipped from 1.5% in October-December.Analysts do not expect a sharp rebound in China’s economy like recoveries in the past, which produced a strong reflationary pulse worldwide. Most say its stimulus has been relatively more restrained this time around, given concerns about high levels of debt left over from past credit sprees.Earlier support measures will take time to fully kick in, and corporate balance sheets are expected to remain under stress if profits are slow to recover from their worst slump in more than seven years.Some analysts such as Nomura warn there is a risk of a “double dip”, where growth appears to be improving only to falter again a few months later. In particular, it noted a further heavy drop in land sales.The central bank has already slashed banks’ reserve requirement ratio five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs.However, some analysts said authorities could be more cautious about further stimulus if data remains solid.China has rolled out many policies to support growth – the key is to implement them, Mao said. — Reuters"

Its top “buy” is YTL REIT, which has resilient rental income from its master lease assets in Malaysia and Japan, as well as a strong pipeline of hotel assets. On Tuesday, the FTSE Russell announced that Malaysia is now on its watch list for a potential disqualification from its WGBI, favouring China. Malaysia’s market accessibility level, now assigned a “2” and included in the FTSE WGBI since 2004, is being considered for a potential downgrade to level “1”, which would render Malaysia ineligible for inclusion in the FTSE WGBI.The final decision may be made in the upcoming annual review in September 2019.The FTSE WGBI is a widely used benchmark that includes sovereign debt from over 20 countries and denominated in a variety of currencies.It is a broad benchmark for the global sovereign fixed-income market."

By right, the seller should be paying the CGT but in this case, Axiata’s unit Ncell has been made to pay for it.
Axiata bought 80% stake in Ncell for RM1.365bil in 2015 from TeliaSonera Norway. 
Not only does Ncell have to pay the CGT, taxes and penalties have been imposed on it because the matter has been dragged on till now.
“It is unfair to make the buyer pay when the onus of paying the CGT falls on the seller. The Nepalese authorities should have imposed CGT on TeliaSonera before it exited the Nepalese market. It should not push that responsibility to Ncell,’’ said an industry expert.
Yesterday, Axiata told Bursa Malaysia in a statement that its unit Ncell had received a letter issued by the Large TaxPayers Office (LTPO) regarding the outstanding tax amount to be paid. 
“The assessment order issued against the seller in relation to the transaction has been transferred to Ncell and it further states that the balance amount of the CGT arising from the transaction due is 39.06 billion rupees. Ncell has been ordered to deposit the same amount within seven days or by April 22,’’ the statement said.
When Axiata bought into Ncell in 2015, it was told to deposit 15% or 23.6 billion rupees. This was paid on assumption that it would get a refund once the seller pays the CGT. 
“Unfortunately, that is not the case now. Instead it now has to settle the entire CGT amount of 62.63 billion rupees including taxes and penalties,’’ said the industry expert.
Axiata and Ncell said in the statement that they were “currently reviewing the LTPO letter and are considering an appropriate course of action in relation to the letter. To date, Axiata and Ncell have dutifully and responsibly complied with all relevant regulatory and legal requirements in relation to the transaction and acknowledge the order without prejudice to their remedial rights.’’
Ncell is Nepal’s largest taxpayer contributing US$1.17bil in taxes since fiscal year 2014/15. Last year, Ncell paid US$257mil, which accounted to 4.2% of total tax revenue for Nepal’s government. 
Over the last two years, Ncell’s total accumulated capital investment reached US$164mil, with US$66mil recorded in the first fiscal year, the statement said.
The statement added that under its corporate social responsibility ambit, Ncell has invested more than 680 million rupees in various social projects identified as critical to the nation, including in education, health disaster management and the environment.
“We believe that the government of Nepal will be supportive of our commitment and use of our investment as a demonstration of the willingness and openness of Nepal to attract further foreign investments.’’
Axiata is a regional telecoms player that has operations in ten countries in Asia. Through its investments in the countries it has connected millions of people."

The country’s national water agency issued a notice to Tuaspring Pte Ltd, asking it to terminate its water purchase agreement with its parent company, Hyflux.
PUB said this was to safeguard Singapore’s water security and the termination notice provides a 30-day notice period, following which the takeover will ensue.
It was previously reported that PUB was willing to purchase the Tuaspring plant for zero dollars and waive any compensations that could be claimed from Hyflux.
According to Singapore Straits Times, the plant has experienced difficulties fulfilling its obligation under the water purchase agreement since 2017 and has recently failed to produce financial evidence that it is able to keep the plant running for the next six months.
Hyflux had entered into a restructuring agreement in October last year with SMI Investments Pte Ltd, a white knight consortium formed between the Salim Group and Medco Group, but the deal fell through. It made a filing with the Singapore Exchange that it has no confidence that SMI was prepared to continue to complete the proposed investment.
SMI had previously said it may have grounds to walk away because Hyflux withheld key information of its financial state, which significantly increased its working capital requirements.
SMI was expected to invest S$530mil for a 60% stake in Hyflux if the deal was successful.
The PUB announcement yesterday sent Malayan Banking Bhd ’s (Maybank) shares going south by 2.28% to RM9, its lowest year-to-date and the first time the counter fell below RM9.19 since July 10 last year.
Maybank is a major financier of Hyflux’s Tuaspring and TuasOne, with a total exposure of RM1.95bil (S$658.6mil).
This is broken down into S$602.4mil for Tuaspring’s Integrated Water and Power Plant and S$56.2mil for TuasOne’s waste-to-energy plant, which will be ready by next month.
AffinHwang Research said in a research note on Tuesday that in a worst-case-scenario that the PUB took over the loss-making Tuaspring desalination plant, Hyflux’s account would have to be fully written-off from Maybank’s books.
“Based on the assumption of a net outstanding loan to Hyflux of RM1.63bil, this may work out to be 15.8% of our 2019 pre-tax profit forecast of RM10.3bil or a 43-basis-point reduction of CET-1 ratio (15% as at December 2018),” it said.
It added that Hyflux made a hefty S$916.5mil impairment in relation to the carrying value of Tuaspring’s assets and the impairment of receivables for previously completed projects, based on its third-quarter 2018 results announcement.
Maybank had set aside collective provisions totalling RM315.1mil as at second-quarter 2018.
The research house downgraded its rating on Maybank from “buy” to “hold” with a target price cut from RM11.50 to RM9.
Banking industry observers said the dip in Maybank’s share price might not be mainly due to the Tuaspring takeover, as it could also be due to Malaysia’s potential exclusion from the World Government Bond Index (WGBI).
While most banking counters closed lower yesterday, Maybank took the heaviest beating among other banking counters and came in sixth as the top loser on Bursa Malaysia.
Hong Leong Bank Bhd  dropped 0.4% to RM20, Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd down 0.5% to RM4 and AMMB Holdings Bhd  down 0.45% to RM4.44.
Public Bank Bhd , CIMB Group Holdings Bhd  and Affin Bank Bhd remained unchanged at RM22.60, RM5.05 and RM2.18, respectively.
RHB Bank Bhd was the only counter which closed higher, increasing 0.7% to RM5.79."

Registrations dropped 3.6% in March to 1.77 million cars, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said. Italy led the declines among major markets with a drop of almost 10%, followed by Spain.
The downturn in the region has extended beyond turmoil that started in September with the introduction of new emission testing rules. 
Italy, where the economy is already shrinking, may weaken further while contracting car sales in Spain are in line with forecasts for a slowdown for an economy that’s been resilient so far.

Chairman Peter Voser will take on the role in the interim during the search for a successor, ABB said in a statement, adding that Spiesshofer and the board “mutually agreed for him to step down” after being in the job since 2013. 
The shares rose as much as 4.7%, the biggest jump in more than four months.
Spiesshofer’s unexpected departure comes after he announced the sale of ABB’s power-grid division to Hitachi Ltd for about US$6.4bil in December, leaving the Swiss company more focused on robotics and automation.
The breakup pushed by activist investor Cevian Capital was long resisted by the outgoing CEO, and on Tuesday another shareholder Artisan Partners urged the manufacturer to go a step further by splitting out its electrification business.
“We will continue to focus on implementing ABB’s strategy and delivering value to all our stakeholders,” Voser said in the statement.  “To achieve our key financial targets, we will proceed with the divestment of ABB’s power grids business as planned, simplify the organizational structure of the group and deliver cost savings.” — Bloomberg
Cevian Capital, which holds a stake of about 5.3 %, on Wednesday reiterated its backing of ABB’s strategy and said it has “full confidence” in Voser and the management team to “continue implementing the transformation.”
The total annualized return of the shares during Spiesshofer’s 5 1/2 years as CEO was just 2.2 % compared with a peer group return of 12 %, Bloomberg data shows.
ABB on Wednesday also published first-quarter results that met analyst estimates. Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization rose 10 % to $766 million while orders were little changed at $7.61 bil.

The Swiss fund manager gained as much as 10% in Zurich trading, erasing this year’s declines. GAM expects to complete the closure of the Absolute Return fund operated by former star trader Tim Haywood by mid-July, it said.
Wrapping up Haywood’s funds - eight months after his suspension triggered a wave of outflows - may revive interest in a sale of the company. GAM has held informal talks with potential buyers for all or part of the business, people familiar with the discussions said in October. Chief executive officer David Jacob later said he was focusing on cleaning up the company internally.
“Having now sold all but the final group of material assets and with an agreement in place which leads to the sale of them as well, we look forward to putting this difficult period behind us,” Jacob said about the absolute return funds yesterday. Money flows in the first quarter will still affected by issues stemming from the funds, he said.
GAM has agreed to sell the remaining material assets from the fund at the valuation at which they were purchased, the company said.
GAM was up 9.2% at 3.83 francs as of 9:23 am.
Jacob took over as acting CEO at the end of last year with GAM reeling from client withdrawals triggered by the suspension of Haywood, who was dismissed in February.
Jacob has cut jobs and merged teams to slash costs, but his biggest challenge has been to stop clients from pulling more cash out of the firm’s funds.
The company reported bigger-than-expected net outflows of about four billion Swiss francs (US$4bil) in investment management, the unit that includes the funds that generates the bulk of GAM’s fees. 
That compared with an estimate of US$2.4bil from Bloomberg data.
Firm-wide assets under management rose by 5.2 billion francs to 137.4 billion francs as of the end of December.
The firm said it expects to make another distribution to investors over the next two weeks, saying it has found a buyer for the “material remaining” Absolute Return assets and it expects to sell the assets without taking a haircut.
Haywood’s ouster for “gross misconduct” capped a tumultuous period for the Swiss firm. 
Assets under management shrank by more than 26.5 billion francs over the whole of last year, the worst drop in a decade. GAM shares have continued to move downwards this year even as stocks of peers rebounded.
The company is cutting 10% of its workforce and the board has proposed slashing the bonus pool for executives by almost two thirds.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/loreals-asian-sales-overtake-europe-for-first-time/,L’Oreal’s Asian sales overtake Europe for first time,Retail,"Thursday, 18 Apr 2019",,"PARIS: Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it’s going next.
L’Oreal SA got more revenue from Asia than from western Europe for the first time last quarter as the region’s surging demand for luxury products continued to resist the drag of a slower Chinese economy.
The shift for the maker of products like Maybelline mascara and Acqua di Gio Armani cologne is the latest example of how French companies have become increasingly dependent on Asia - and particularly China - to maintain growth. Ten years ago, L’Oreal’s Asian sales were less than a third of those in its home market of western Europe.
Asia’s importance to L’Oreal is almost certain to keep growing as many European economies stagnate or even shrink, and as China implements policies to encourage its citizens to shop on the mainland rather than during foreign vacations or through black-market resellers. 
Chinese growth seems to be recovering somewhat, with 6.4% growth in gross domestic product last quarter, topping economists’ estimates.
“It’s true that the growth is not broad-based,” RBC analyst James Edwardes Jones said in a note to clients, “but given L’Oreal’s proven ability to identify, stimulate and capitalise on those parts of the business where the most attractive growth is to be had, we struggle to find fault with this.”
The results show luxury’s resilience, as surging demand from Chinese shoppers fuelled 14% quarterly growth for the division selling brands like Armani, Kiehl’s, and YSL.
Meanwhile, some other manufacturers of products such as automobiles and electronics were hurt by a slowing Chinese economy.
“It’s a real appetite of the young generation in China to go directly to these luxury brands. 
“It’s really positive for us,” chief executive officer Jean-Paul Agon said on a call with analysts. 
Western Europe showed some signs of improvement and could post a solid year, Agon said, “but nothing that would compete with what we see in Asia.”
Paris-based L’Oreal isn’t the only company making French business dependent on China for growth. 
Leaders in the luxury industry - where Chinese shoppers are estimated to make up roughly one-third of global sales - including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Gucci owner Kering and Hermes International all figure among France’s biggest companies by market value.
Sales in the company’s biggest division, which markets names like Garnier shampoo and Maybelline mascara, continued to lag behind. 
Garnier tried to spark growth among shoppers concerned about chemicals in beauty products with a line of organics like lavender-infused moisturiser.
Active cosmetics, L’Oreal’s premium skin-care division with brands like Laroche Posay, was another bright spot for the group. 
L’Oreal said sales of the American brand CeraVe - which they acquired in 2017 - rose more than 40% during the quarter after they rolled out the dermatology-inspired label worldwide.
First-quarter revenue rose 7.7% excluding currency shifts to €7.55bil, the world’s biggest cosmetics maker said in a statement after Paris markets closed on Tuesday.
Analysts had predicted €7.4bil.
L’Oreal’s stock rose as much as 1.6% to €244.20 euros in Paris trading yesterday. 
The company’s shares have gained 21% this year.  Last week, the company surpassed gas-and-oil giant Total SA to become France’s second largest company by market value. — Bloomberg"

Latest analysis of data disclosed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that Jet’s lessors have, so far, sought to deregister and repossess at least four dozen of the planes operated by Jet. 
Once deregistered, lessors are free to reclaim a plane and lease it to another airline anywhere in the world.
The moves come even as Jet scrambles to secure emergency funds and its lenders try to hurry through a sale process to identify an investor willing to acquire a majority stake in the airline and attempt to turn it around.
Lenders are likely to invite binding bids from four shortlisted suitors, private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, Indian sovereign wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and the UAE’s Etihad Airways that already owns a minority stake in Jet, local media reported.
TPG declined to comment, while the other three did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Jet will be forced to shut down as soon as yesterday if it does not get emergency funding from its lenders, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Jet CEO Vinay Dube said on Tuesday in a letter to employees, seen by Reuters, that the carrier had stressed to its lenders the need for some urgent funding, critical to the continuation of its operations.
At its peak, Jet had over 120 planes and hundreds of daily flights. 
The airline, once India’s leading private carrier, has been forced in recent months to cancel hundreds of flights to dozens of domestic and overseas destinations.
On its website, Jet Airways disclosed it was operating only about three dozen flights yesterday.

South-East Asia’s second-biggest bank by assets is talking to various firms that have shown an interest in such a partnership, he said.“We will prefer to partner with companies that have a larger franchise already” so OCBC can sell into its existing client base, Tsien said, adding that the bank hasn’t applied for a licence yet.Under President Xi Jinping, China is gradually taking steps to give foreign financial firms more access to the world’s second-largest economy. That’s prompted banks from Credit Suisse Group AG to JPMorgan Chase & Co to seek a piece of the more than US$40 trillion financial industry through controlling stakes in local ventures.“For us, what we need is to be able to reach out to as many potential customers as we can” through a securities joint venture, Tsien said. Without extensive branch networks or a digital presence in China, “it’s very difficult for foreign banks to be able to reach out to them.”UBS in December became the first foreign bank to gain majority control of a Chinese securities joint venture under new rules. JPMorgan and Nomura Holdings Inc received their approvals last month.Tsien said OCBC is on track to achieve a goal of doubling pre-tax profit in China’s Greater Bay Area to S$1bil (US$740mil) by 2023. “It’s possible that we’re able to beat that”, he said.China is embarking on a sweeping plan to combine nine cities in the Pearl River Delta with Hong Kong and Macau – a region known as the Greater Bay Area – to create a financial and technology hub that could rival California’s Silicon Valley.

UOB Kay Hian Research singled out  Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd as among the major beneficiaries, aside from other Sarawak-listed companies like Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd , Petra Energy Bhd , KKB Engineering Bhd  (via OceanMight) and Brooke Dockyard.
The research house recently attended the Sarawak oil & gas seminar and exhibition, said the issues covered during the conference included Petros’ plans,  and matters relating to vendor development and reserves data. 
By end-2019, it said, Petros would take firm action to implement the state’s mandate, particularly in relation to revenue sharing and local participation. 
“We believe this is necessary to kick start delayed greenfield projects,” it said in a note.
The research house, which maintained its “market weight” stance on the sector, said Petros CEO Sauu Kakok clarified during the seminar that their key targets included driving more share of revenue from Sarawak O&G resources and boosting participation of Sarawakians.
Petros, it said, was actively working towards meeting the “hard target timeline” of Dec 31 for measures including setting up governance policies. 
“This implies that the one-year grace period for Petronas, Putrajaya (and its key advisors), and Sarawak state will conclude. 
“We understand further delays are unlikely as all stakeholders are working hard to reach firm agreements,” the research house said.
Petros, which was set up in August 2017, is in charge of regulating upstream production, governed under the oil mining ordinance 1958. It is also regulating the gas distribution governed under the distribution of gas ordinance.A technical session during the seminar revealed that the Sarawak basin has 23% of Malaysia’s oil and 51% of natural gas.
For the overall sector, UOB Kay Hian said many O&G stocks remained “too locally dependent”.  It noted that Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) would focus on overseas upstream capex, while domestic upstream capex is set to improve from RM12bil in 2018 to RM15bil in 2019. 
“We understand local activity levels have generally increased, especially for maintenance/brownfield works, with maintenance, construction and modification contractors like Dayang Enterprise and Petra Energy guiding high activity levels in 2019 although rates remain low,” it said.
The research house said it favoured internationally competitive companies, like engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning and storage operator Dialog Group Bhd  and Yinson Holdings Bhd ."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/18/building-msian-economy-based-on-digital-competency/,Building Malaysian economy based on digital competency,Economy,"Thursday, 18 Apr 2019",,"THE Pakatan Harapan government has been in place for almost a year.
While it is assuring to see that the “New Malaysia” under Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s leadership has shown great resolve in charting a new course, let me be blunt: I have not seen any substantial effort in leading our country towards the digital economy.
What is the digital economy? What’s the big fuss about it? What are the key ingredients? Why must Malaysia act today and not give political excuses? How do we ensure that our future generations do not become outcasts of the world?
Laying it out
During the 20th century, the prosperity of countries around the world was highly correlated to their ability to evolve from an agricultural economy to various levels of industrialisation.
Industrialisation was the inevitable blueprint for building a nation, so many policy makers channelled their national development goals toward it. Malaysia was on the right track with our very own industrialisation initiatives such as the Look East Policy, the national car initiative, and so on.
Thus, the more advanced economies were those that had attained higher levels of industrialisation, and agricultural-based economies were at a disadvantage.
The unwritten rules of international engagement favoured developed nations, under the pretext of celebrating a liberal and globalised economy.
We’re now facing the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0), where the speed, sophistication and profound impact of digital technologies are integrated into various conventional industries at a massive scale that has never been seen before in the history of humanity.
This, to me, is the single most significant turning point in the history of mankind. It has opened up a contemporary Pandora’s box. Our civilisation can make a quantum leap from the world of science fiction to one based on science fact.
According to Klause Schwab, the chairman of World Economic Forum, IR4.0 is characterised by a much more ubiquitous and mobile Internet (as seen in China); by smaller and more powerful sensors (that collect all the digital data from every user of any computer device) that are becoming cheaper and cheaper; and finally with the boom in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
(Think about why the US government is so hostile to China – it is because China is leading the world in the development of AI.)
Having lived and worked in China for the past 23 years, I believe IR4.0 is happening in China now, and it will be the incubator for the world’s science and technology development.
And I am concerned that Malaysia will be left behind if we continue to let our little politics overwhelm us.
Defining digital
So what exactly is the digital economy? I like the definition provided by consulting firm Deloitte, as this reflects what I have witnessed in China: The digital economy is the economic activity that results from billions of everyday online connections among people, businesses, devices, data, and processes.
The backbone of the digital economy is hyper-connectivity, or the growing interconnectedness of people, organisations, and machines that results from the Internet, mobile technology and the Internet of Things (IoT).
When German Chancellor Angela Merkel retained her office earlier this year, during her phone conversation with China President Xi Jinping, she is reported to have told him how she wish she had WeChat Pay in Germany as this was crucial infrastructure to further lubricate economic activity.
The digital economy is taking shape and undermining conventional notions about how businesses are structured; how firms interact; and how consumers obtain services, information, and goods.
This part is the most crucial bit, as it explains the advanced level of progress you can actually witness in some societies.
For example, in China, when a car drives into a basement of a shopping mall, there is no need for the driver to wind down the window to grab a parking ticket.
The visual recognition system of the parking lot automatically scans the car’s number plate.
(In our new Tencent office, we have taken it a step further, by having a plan that directs the automobile to an empty parking space.)
When the car leaves the parking lot, the system would automatically deduct the parking fees from WeChat Pay.
There are many other such examples.
In simple terms, the digital economy refers to the components of the economy that are transformed or empowered by digitalisation.
Diving deeper
But what do we mean by “digitalisation”?
To me, digitalisation is the single most powerful economic catalyst, resulting from billions of online connections between people, communities, businesses, devices, work processes, etc.
It is the fundamental process where data is generated, collected, analysed and eventually served as the single most valuable asset in the contemporary world.
It is said that data today is the single most valuable currency.
What would the impact of a digital economy be to the gross domestic product (GDP) of a nation?
When I was at an International Monetary Fund conference last year, central bankers and economists from 180 countries gathered to discuss this.
It was commonly accepted that the development of a nation has a strong correlation to how much a country has invested in building a digital ecosystem and infrastructure.
For example, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, South Korea and Japan are seen as leading the world in their level of digitalisation. And these countries have also attained a higher rank in the global GDP. (Strangely, the United States does not rank so high in digitalising its economy.)
Today, 32% of China’s GDP is attributed to the digital economy.
Here is the key: In China’s experience, there are two components of the digital economy that are being counted in its GDP. The first component is the direct contribution from the conventional ICT industry. This is not surprising.
The big deal is the second component, which results from the empowerment, via digitalisation, of conventional industries such as agricultural, pharmaceutical, transportation, services, etc.
This part contributed almost 75% of the digital economy components. This is the part where the rest of the world is not learning enough from China.
Also, global communities are already meeting to deliberate on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on our common future.
Recently, I was invited by Unesco as a keynote panellist to discuss the sustainability of AI going forward.
AI will rearrange the world’s industries, resulting in a new definition of jobs and the emergence of hybrid technologies. It would this redefine what education will be.
In short, we are now in the dawn of a digital civilisation.
The building blocks of the digital economy
Long ago, Dr Mahathir and his leadership team during his previous tenure as premier, had the vision and saw this coming.
In the mid to late 1990s, we had aspirations like the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), the Information Superhighway and Vision 2020.
Sadly, visionary ideas like these are now no longer seen as the priority, at least not from the perspective of the public.
Just scan through the key issues being discussed in the Parliament as well as media headlines over the past 180 days. We have become a closeted nation with a populist agenda setting the direction for our policy makers.
People elected to public office are supposed to be leading our future – instead, they are more concerned with keeping their positions, rather than in doing what’s right for our beloved nation and her people. There have been too many U-turns on public policies.
(And please, those of you from Barisan Nasional, you do not get to play the righteous role now and capitalise on this statement. We wouldn’t be where we are today if it hadn’t been for 60 years of your mismanagement).
Having said that, credit should be given where it is due. In retrospect, the MSC envisioned by Dr Mahathir was way ahead of time.
But we must also reflect upon ourselves, on what we missed in the past two decades in failing to develop and build our nation into one that should have been ready for this digital economy.
In my opinion, the digital economy is just the dawning stage of what I would call the digital civilisation. The world will soon move into an era where the free flow of talents, culture and data would determine the new definition of global dominance.
If we do not act quickly, we will lose our last chance to retain the best Malaysian-born talents, not to mention to having the ability to attract world-class talents to join us in building our industries.
Oxford University published a research report noting that by the year 2025, more than half of the jobs in the United States will potentially be replaced by machines. Think about what will happen to Malaysia in competing globally.
And AI is not new or mere tech jargon; it has been around for more than half a century. It will sweep the world into a brand new order soon.
And very sadly, I read what DAP stalwart Lim Kit Siang said during the recent 5th International Biotechnology Competition and Exhibition 2019, that an international study has concluded that Malaysia is not yet ready for AI and needs to substantially improve its preparedness.
Our next-door neighbour (Singapore) is way ahead.
Given my personal involvement, passionate observation and keen participation as a keynote speaker in all sorts of senior government-level forums over the past five years here, I am not entirely surprised.
All the ideas and dialogues have resulted in no concrete action, not to mention the lack of policies to move the needle.
I have been a keynote speaker for numerous high-profile events, attended by the previous premier and various senior ministers, such as the Malaysian Digital Economy Conference, the Malaysian Higher Education Conference for IR 4.0, the Cashless Society Conference, the FinTech for Islamic Finance event organised by Bank Negara Malaysia, just to name a few.
Lots of ideas were given and shared, but sadly, few were implemented or perhaps even noted.
So here is my stark warning:
We can continue to pretend that all government policies are made in the interest of the rakyat. But no matter how united we may be, if we do not make any progress as a nation, there will be nothing more to fight for within this nation. We shouldn’t be looking at how to redistribute wealth between different people within Malaysia.
Instead, we should be looking outside at the greater waves of globalisation and technology innovation. Progress in the future will be determined by one thing: How ready we are as a nation to embrace the building blocks of a digital economy.Not some affirmative action, to build or not to build a railway, to have a flying car, to have a third national car, or to remain or withdraw from some Roman treaty.
So please, Putrajaya, here are some of the key requirements for Malaysia to move towards a digital economy:
1) A conducive digital entrepreneurship ecosystema. We must aim to have a few large Malaysian platform companies. China is digitalised because of hundreds of digital entrepreneurs that now rival the world.
b. During a recent meeting at Palace Elysee, a representative from California mentioned that the GDP of that US state last quarter was larger than that of the United Kingdom, due to the contribution of the start-up ecosystem.
2) A high level of digital adoption culture leading to an online lifestyle societya. The government must help to inculcate a digital society by firstly making available immediately a world-class broadband infrastructure.
b. Studies must be done to determine which parts of the online lifestyle that might be suitable for the Malaysian culture and socio-economic backdrop. Without active “super communities” of digital citizens, there will be no basis for a digital economy.
c. Having companies such as Tencent and Alibaba invest heavily would not move the needle unless the people in this country are geared and cultivated for digital adoption.
3) Build a smart city infrastructurea.Start small with cities that are more ready in terms of current infrastructure.
b.Encourage the Kuala Lumpur City Council to study China’s smart city concept. The city of Brisbane in Australia, where I am honorary ambassador, is even more advanced. The smart city concept should be the single biggest KPI (key performance indicator) for all city mayors. If there are no digital services from the public sector, a city is not ready for tomorrow.
4) Encourage investment into the digitalisation of the private sectora. The digital economy is a “Capitalism 2.0” concept where companies and communities have to take a more proactive role to resolve the challenges of their societies.
b. How do we achieve this?Bolder policies to attract better investments into the ICT sector to help jumpstart our digital economy? What incentives can be provided?
5) A liberal and civil regulation not to stifle innovation
a. There should be less government in business. French President Emmanuel Macron recently told me that in order for France to be a “start-up nation”, the government must firstly become a “startup government”.
b. Less politics in business, please. Need I say more?
6) Revamp the education system and start emphasising AIa. It is crucial to produce enough talents who know how to ride the AI tiger. There is a window, because everyone is really just learning the fundamentals of AI.
b. The potential of AI lies in the area of finding the right applications within the current playing fields, such as transportation, medicine, pharmaceutics, education, biotechnology, etc. So, AI is not a single subject by itself, but it would involve learning new ways to learn, involving multiple disciplines of education.
c. Government must also pay attention to retraining our current workforce to better equip themselves for the IR4.0 future.
In closing
The ideas I have shared may sound pretty simplistic, but the effort needed to move the needle significantly under each category will take years, and it might even go beyond a few terms of governments.
The single largest obstacle we face would be a political one. But this mission has to be treated beyond any political agenda as key to the competitiveness of the nation and the welfare of our people. Our future generations depend on it.
Right now, Malaysia is in need of statesmanship that is willing to look beyond the political divide and do what is right for our country. We are very close to missing the boat entirely. We will certainly do so if nothing changes.

Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) president, Datuk Seri Garry Chua said the good relations between Malaysia and China after the revival of the East Coast Rail Line (ECRL) project could also result in a boost in the tourism sector.

""The expectation is also in line with the gross domestic product's growth projection of between 4.3% and 4.8%,” he said at the sidelines of the Retail Industry Forum here on Wednesday. 

However, he said the food and beverages (F and B) sector is expected to experience a slowdown due to financial constraints among Malaysians, leading to lower spending power.

The F and B sector grew 2.6% per cent in 2018 -- a performance which is expected to be maintained this year.  

Chua added that with the boost in the tourism sector, the retail industry could experience a double-digit growth, otherwise, the market sentiment would remain sluggish. 

""By 2020, Malaysia will have about 600 to 700 malls, and Malaysia only has 32 million people, which is relatively low. 

""If tourism does not increase, business would not be performing. This will lead to shop closures and thus a glut in retail space,"" he added.  

He said the retail segment recorded a slow growth of between 2% and 4% in the last six years, compared with the double-digit growth before that.

""The increase in tourism will have a fast ripple effect on the economy as they are big spenders. I believe that we need to catch up with our neighbouring countries in promoting tourism as it will contribute to a significant spin-off to 

the economy which we are lacking right now,"" he said.  

According to Tourism Malaysia's statistics, the number of tourist arrivals has been almost stagnant over the past four years, with 25.72 million arrivals in 2015, 26.76 million in 2016, 25.95 million in 2017 and 25.83 million in 2018. - Bernama"

FTSE said on Monday that it would review Malaysia's market accessibility level in its World Government Bond Index (WGBI) due to concerns about market liquidity.

Malaysia, currently assigned a '2' and included in the WGBI since 2004, was being considered for a potential downgrade to '1', making it ineligible for inclusion, FTSE said.

In early European trades, the regional Euro Stoxx 600 and German DAX were mostly unchanged while London's FTSE was a shade weaker as near 5 percent drop in iron ore prices hit its heavyweight miners.

Moves in Asian share markets had been mostly modest too, in part because they had already rallied hard since the start of the year.

Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.25 percent after hitting a five-month peak while the Shanghai Composite made 0.3 percent to score its highest close since March 21, 2018 after jumping 2.4 percent on Tuesday.

Investors have been counting on better news from China and were not disappointed with first-quarter economic growth pipping forecast at 6.4 percent.

Importantly industrial output surged 8.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace since July 2014 and well above forecasts of a 5.9 percent increase. Retail sales also pleased with a rise of 8.7 percent.

Investors reacted by buying the Australian dollar, often a liquid proxy for China plays, which pushed up 0.3 percent to a two-month top at $0.7206.

Allianz Global Investors strategist and portfolio manager Neil Dwane said the data had good enough to allay fears China's economy was collapsing although the rest of the year remained in question.

""Beijing will now be in a wait and see mode to gauge whether it has done enough,"" Dwane said. ""To be bullish (on stocks) from here you would have to believe in a pretty strong global recovery in the second half... We are a bit more ho-hum.""

Still, the fact that there were at some green shoots appearing in world economy pushed benchmark government bond yields higher. German Bund yields hit a 4-week high, albeit at 0.1 percent they are still barely above zero.

In currency markets, the U.S. dollar finally managed to top resistance on the yen at 112.13 to reach its highest since December at 112.16.

Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was a tad weaker at 96.908 but still within the 95.00 to 97.70 range that has held for the past six months.

The euro edged up a touch to $1.1315, recovering from losses driven by a Reuters report that several European Central Bank policymakers think the bank's economic projections are too optimistic.

JUVENTUS THUMPED

One currency on the move was the New Zealand dollar which sank as far as $0.6668 after annual consumer price inflation came in well below expectations at just 1.5 percent for the first quarter.

The improved Chinese data gave it a helping hand back up to $0.6744 later but yields on two-year Kiwi bonds have already dived 9 basis points to 1.48 percent as investors wagered the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) would have to cut rates.

In commodity markets, the general improvement in risk sentiment saw spot gold slip to its lowest for the year so far. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1,279.25 per ounce.

Oil prices were buoyed again as fighting in Libya and falling Venezuelan and Iranian exports raised concerns over tightening global supply.

U.S. crude was last up 48 cents at $64.53 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 34 cents to $72.06.

The big mover, however, was China's Dalian iron ore futures which plunged after Brazilian miner Vale SA said it was preparing to resume operations at its huge Brucutu mine in the coming days.

The mine, with annual capacity of 30 million tonnes, has remained shut since early February after a tailings dam burst in late January, killing hundreds of people.

The most-traded iron ore futures for September delivery on the Dalian commodity Exchange sank as much as 4.7 and closed down 3.8 percent at 621 yuan ($92.86).

Nearly 60 percent of regional banks could suffer net losses a decade from now if corporate borrowing keeps falling at the current trend, the central bank said in a semi-annual report on Japan’s banking system on Wednesday.

The report, which is among key factors the BOJ board will scrutinise in deciding monetary policy, highlights the mounting demerits of prolonged monetary easing such as the damage it is inflicting on financial institutions’ profits.

“As regional banks have generally not been able to secure profits commensurate with the increase in risk-weighed assets, their capital adequacy ratios and stress resilience have declined moderately,” the BOJ said in the report.

“Should this situation persist, downward pressure on the real economy from the financial system could intensify,” it said.

The BOJ’s financial system report analyses whether there are any excessive risk-taking among financial institutions, as well as how resilient they are to various risks and market shocks.

It includes a heat map detecting signs of overheating or contraction in financial activity.

Among the indicators in the heat map, an index measuring the ratio of real estate loans to gross domestic product (GDP) turned ”red,” or showed signs of overheating, for the first time since the end of 1990, the BOJ said.

The remaining 13 indicators were ”green,” which showed financial and economic activities as a whole have not shown excessive movements, according to the report.

“Financial and economic activities as a whole have shown no signs of overheating as observed during Japan’s asset-inflated bubble period in the late 1980s,” the report said.

“But possible vulnerabilities of the real estate market warrant close attention, as financial institutions that have been active in extending loans to rental housing businesses tend to have relatively low capital adequacy ratios,” it said. - Reuters"

The Times of India reported earlier that Aramco was in talks to buy a stake of up to 25 percent, which could be worth around $10-15 billion, valuing the Indian company's refining and petrochemicals businesses at some $55-60 billion.

Aramco's discussions with Reliance were ""serious"", one source said. Another source said talks with Reliance were so far for a 25 percent stake.

Aramco and Reliance declined to comment.

Reliance, controlled by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, is India's biggest refining and petrochemicals company and runs a 1.4 million barrels per day refining complex at Jamnagar in western India. It plans to expand capacity to 2 

million bpd by 2030, according to plans shared with the Indian government.

Aramco is expanding its refining and petrochemical business globally by signing new deals and boosting the capacity of its existing plants.

Last year, Aramco and the United Arab Emirates' national oil company ADNOC teamed up with state-run Indian refiners in a plan to build a 1.2 million bpd refinery and petrochemical project in Maharashtra state.

However, the planned refinery faces delays, as thousands of farmers have refused to surrender land for it and the Maharashtra government is looking to move the plant's location.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited India in February and said then that he expected investment opportunities worth more than $100 billion there over the next two years.

Ambani has travelled to Saudi Arabia at least twice since December, discussing joint investment among other issues with Aramco's chief executive, Amin Nasser. - Reuters"

The offer by Japan’s biggest paint maker to pay A$9.80 for each Dulux share represents a 28% premium, the companies said in a statement. 
In terms of large deals, that compares with Sherwin-Williams Co’s offer in 2014 to buy rival Valspar Corp for about US$9.3bil at a 35% premium.
It’s the biggest acquisition yet by Nippon Paint, which has said it’s looking to buy global rivals to keep pace with consolidation in a US$140bil global industry where the top 10 suppliers account for more than half of sales worldwide. 
The Osaka-based company made a bid in 2017 for Axalta Coating Systems Ltd, the world’s largest maker of coatings for cars, though the offer failed to produce a deal. 
Axalta had a market value of about US$8bil at the time.
“This is a logical acquisition, given the strength of the Dulux brand name in the Australian and New Zealand markets, the attractive stable growth potential of the region, and the opportunity the acquisition affords to bolster Nippon Paint’s regional portfolio,” Atsushi Ikeda, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc, wrote in a note to clients.
Although Dulux is Australia and New Zealand’s top paint and coatings company, it ranks at 22nd in the world, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Dulux shares shot up to close near the offer price in Sydney trading, while Nippon paint fell 3.6% in Tokyo.
Dulux will retain its name and leadership team that will operate as a division within Nippon Paint as the Japanese company adds Australia and New Zealand to operations in Asia, Europe and the United States, the companies said.
Dulux had sales of A$1.84bil in the year ended Sept 30. 
Nippon Paint’s offer values the company at about two times revenue, compared with the 2.43 times median for global paint and coatings maker deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Nippon Paint has an A credit rating from Rating and Investment and Information Inc, which said yesterday it is monitoring the company for possible downgrade.
“Its financial base will deteriorate more than R&I anticipated,” the ratings agency said in a statement. 
“Even if a light capital investment burden, which is characteristic of a paint manufacturing business, is taken into account, it will highly likely take time before the company improves its financial balance,” said the ratings agency.

Powers, who joined in January 2018, resigned for personal reasons and has decided to return to the United States, Etihad said in a statement confirming an earlier Reuters report.
He has been replaced in the interim by senior Etihad finance executive Adam Boukadida, the airline said on Tuesday. Etihad said it was searching for a permanent replacement.
Etihad did not say when Powers left the airline. Boukadida has served as interim Group CFO since March, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Powers was hired as the airline embarked on a five-year turnaround plan after a strategy of buying stakes in other airlines collapsed, contributing to billions of dollars in losses.
Group chief executive Tony Douglas said in 2018 Powers would “play a pivotal role in helping to guide Etihad onto the next stage of its development”.
Etihad reported a US$1.28bil loss for 2018, down from a US$1.52bil loss in 2017. It has lost US$4.75bil since 2016.
Powers, a former JetBlue CFO, was hired by Etihad following a major shake-up of management that included the departure of long-serving Group CEO James Hogan and Group CFO James Rigney.
The airline, which launched a five-year turnaround strategy in 2017, trimmed its ambitions and started reorganising as a mid-sized carrier focused on point-to-point traffic in 2018.

The move could handicap the app’s owner, China’s Bytedance Ltd, the world’s most highly valued startup, in one of its most promising markets.An Indian state court had earlier asked the federal government to ban TikTok, citing concerns the video-sharing mobile app exposed children to troubling content, including pornography.
Bytedance fought the proposal, but was overruled by India’s Supreme Court.
Regulators then asked Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple Inc to remove TikTok from their app stores.
Representatives for Google and Apple declined to comment. The court ruling restricts future downloads of the app in India, not existing users, said one of the people familiar with the decision, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.
A Bytedance spokeswoman declined to comment on the app store decisions, but provided a statement on the India situation: “The case is still ongoing to date,” the company said.
“We have faith in the Indian judicial system and we are optimistic about an outcome that would be well received by over 120 million monthly active users in India.”
India is one of several nations across Asia adopting more draconian oversight of Internet companies, similar to the way China regulates the web.
Bytedance, which creates social and news-reading apps, has most of its users and sales in China.
But TikTok has exploded in popularity elsewhere, giving Bytedance more global reach than any other Chinese tech company.

However, the planned refinery faces delays, as thousands of farmers have refused to surrender land for it and the Maharashtra government is looking to move the plant’s location.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited India in February and said then that he expected investment opportunities worth more than $100 bil there over the next two years.

The company nevertheless expected sales growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.
“The first quarter showed a start of the year in line with expectations ...We are pleased with the momentum of the business which will become increasingly visible from the second quarter. 
“This gives us every confidence that we will meet our full year guidance,” CEO Emmanuel Faber said in a statement.

Danone added it was on track to deliver on its 2020 goals for an operating margin above 16% of its sales and like-for-like sales growth of 4-5%.
Danone’s waters division and its dairy business put in solid performances over the quarter, but sales of Danone’s Early Life Nutrition products in China fell around 15% in the quarter, partly due to a lower birth rate in China.
This compared with a 10% decline in the fourth quarter 2018 and a 20% decline in the third quarter, in that division.
China is an important source of growth for Danone, contributing about 30% of sales of the Early Life Nutrition business, which makes infant formula and general baby food products.

Nearly 60% of regional banks could suffer net losses a decade from now if corporate borrowing keeps falling at the current trend, the central bank said in a semi-annual report on Japan’s banking system yesterday.
The report, which is among key factors the BoJ board will scrutinise in deciding monetary policy, highlights the mounting demerits of prolonged monetary easing such as the damage it is inflicting on financial institutions’ profits.
“As regional banks have generally not been able to secure profits commensurate with the increase in risk-weighed assets, their capital adequacy ratios and stress resilience have declined moderately,” the BoJ said in the report.“Should this situation persist, downward pressure on the real economy from the financial system could intensify,” it said.
The BoJ’s financial system report analyses whether there are any excessive risk-taking among financial institutions, as well as how resilient they are to various risks and market shocks.It includes a heat map detecting signs of overheating or contraction in financial activity.
Among the indicators in the heat map, an index measuring the ratio of real estate loans to gross domestic product (GDP) turned “red,” or showed signs of overheating, for the first time since the end of 1990, the BoJ said.
The remaining 13 indicators were “green,” which showed financial and economic activities as a whole have not shown excessive movements, according to the report.
“Financial and economic activities as a whole have shown no signs of overheating as observed during Japan’s asset-inflated bubble period in the late 1980s,” the report pointed out.
“But possible vulnerabilities of the real estate market warrant close attention, as financial institutions that have been active in extending loans to rental housing businesses tend to have relatively low capital adequacy ratios,” it said. — Reuters"

With the addition of these new contracts, the group's outstanding order book comes to RM406mil with the majority coming from the UHP segment at 73%, followed by process engineering at 19% and general contracting at 7%.

The research house said on Wednesday Sapura Energy announced several contracts on April 12, and more could follow as it is in the process of bidding for many more contracts. 

“The key is how profitable these contracts will be, given that Sapura Energy  has been under pressure to build its orderbook and may have bid competitively,” it said.

To recap, the company secured RM1.279bil in new contracts, of which the research house estimates RM400mil are in new drilling contracts, and RM900mil in new engineering and construction (E&C) contracts. 

Sapura Energy had earlier disclosed that it had a RM17.2bil orderbook as at Jan 31, 2019, so the new wins will raise the proforma Jan 31 orderbook to RM18.5bil, or RM18.6bil factoring in another drilling contract which had not yet been announced by Sapura Energy but already reflected in Riglogix’s database. 

“We had factored in RM4.7bil in E&C revenue for FY1/20F, against RM4.6bil in contracts won to-date.
 
“Our revenue target may be exceeded since we are still in the early part of the financial year, but we are more concerned about how profitable these contracts will be,” it said.

 Sapura Energy’s E&C arm delivered an estimated EBITDA margin of only 1% in FY19, or 5.6% if excluding a RM170m in cost overruns from a domestic onshore project, which compares unfavourably to FY18’s EBITDA margin of c.10% and FY17’s c.13%. 

For E&C contracts to be executed in FY20F, CIMB Research factored in an EBITDA margin of 5%, which it believes is reasonable, albeit tight. 

“The risks to Sapura Energy’s E&C earnings remains high, given that the expected thin margins leave little room for error in execution. 

“We have assumed Sapura Energy to deliver E&C revenue of RM5bn and an EBITDA margin of 10% for FY21F, assuming that global E&C asset utilisation rates improve following an expected increase in offshore capex,” it said.

CIMB Research said Sapura Energy is bidding for E&C work in Qatar’s North Field, India’s Heera field, Saudi Arabia’s Marjan and Zuluf fields, Mozambique’s Mamba field, pipeline installation work in Greece and India, among many others, as reported by Upstream. 

New contracts for Sapura Energy’s tender drilling rigs (TDR) SAPE announced two new contracts for the T-9 tender barge and the Berani semi-tender worth c.US$100m. Another contract for the T-18 worth c.US$22mil was reported by Riglogix but yet to be announced by Sapura Energy. 

“Based on contracts secured to-date, the TDR fleet as a whole is poised to deliver 41% utilisation rate in FY20F, which should rise once more drilling work is secured, to our forecast of 46%. 

“But we note that there are big differences between the shallow-water tender barge fleet which has secured contracts for 24% utilisation, vs. the deep-water-capable semi-tender fleet with 61% utilisation for FY20F. 

“We expect this to persist, as tender barges compete with more flexible and more competitively-priced jack-up rigs in Southeast Asia. 

“As such, for the forecast period, we lower our utilisation assumption for tender barges from 35% to 30%, and raise our utilisation assumption for semi-tenders from 60% to 65%,” CIMB Research said."

The deal - recommended by the Dulux board - is the latest in a slew of Japanese acquisitions in Australia and would catapult Nippon Paint from a bit player to the biggest paint seller in the region as it seeks growth outside its home market.

However, it comes as Australia's construction sector approaches a precipice as building approvals - a forward indicator of demand for home improvement products - have hit five-year lows.

DuluxGroup stock soared 28 percent in early trade to the offer price of A$9.80, a record high. The broader market opened flat.

The cash offer includes A$0.15 per share of interim dividend that DuluxGroup intends to pay.

""The price point that they've paid is quite incredible,"" said portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu at Tribeca Investment Partners, a fund manager which exited DuluxGroup stock ahead of a slowdown in the building materials sector.

""It's a very good company, great management, it's just that the outlook isn't that great,"" she said. ""Even though paint is pretty defensive, when the volume is falling substantially... it's looking challenging.""

The deal comes as Dulux Group's revenue growth slows and building materials suppliers face a strong headwind as an east-coast homebuilding boom winds down and home valuations drop sharply.

""We have unanimously concluded that the transaction with Nippon is in the best interests of our shareholders,"" said Graeme Liebelt, chairman of Dulux Group, which was spun off from explosives-maker Orica Ltd in 2010.

Nippon Paint Chief Executive Tetsushi Tado said DuluxGroup would be run as a separate division and he expected no changes to its leadership, business portfolio, manufacturing or operations.

""Dulux Group will still be Dulux Group,"" he said.

Shares in Nippon Paint, the fifth-largest paint seller in the world by market capitalisation, opened 3.4 percent lower in Tokyo.

The proposal will be subject to regulatory scrutiny from foreign investment regulators in both Australia and New Zealand.

Nippon Paint, which currently has no operations in Australia and New Zealand, said it expects to fund the proposed deal via a debt acquisition facility and that the offer is not conditional on Nippon Paint securing funds. - Reuters"

Electronics shipments dropped 26.7 percent from a year ago, weighing down overall non-oil domestic exports, which fell 11.7 percent. That was far worse than the 2.2 percent contraction forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.

The Chinese economic slowdown, uncertainty over U.S.-China trade talks, and disruptions around the Lunar New Year holidays have soured exports numbers this year, especially in trade-reliant economies like Singapore’s. 

The city state’s critical electronics sector has contracted for 15 of the past 16 months after an unexpected surge across the region for much of 2017.

Weaker Chinese demand has also resulted in exports to the U.S. outpacing those to China for the first time in more than seven years.

Economists are counting on a recovery in Chinese demand, helped by government stimulus measures, which should filter through to the region’s economies. 

Data on Wednesday will probably show China’s economy grew 6.3 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. - Bloomberg"

The upbeat readings, which also showed faster growth in retail sales and investment, are likely to add to optimism that China’s cooling economy may be starting to stabilise, relieving some investor anxiety over sputtering global demand.

But analysts say it is too early to call a sustainable turnaround, and further policy support is likely needed.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected growth to slow slightly to 6.3 percent in the January-March quarter, the slowest pace in at least 27 years.

China’s economy is seeing more positive factors at present, although it still faces many external uncertainties, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday in a statement along with the data.

Industrial production jumped 8.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace in over 4-1/2 years. The reading easily beat analysts’ estimates of 5.9 percent and the 5.3 percent seen in the first two months of the year.

Retail sales rose 8.7 percent in March, also beating analyst’s estimates of 8.4 percent growth and the previous 8.2 percent.

Fixed-asset investment expanded 6.3 percent in January-to-March from the same period a year earlier, in line with estimates of 6.3 percent.

Real estate investment rose 11.8 percent in the first three months, quickening slightly from the 11.6 percent gain in the January-to-February.

Analysts polled by Reuters expect China’s economic growth to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, as sluggish demand at home and abroad and the Sino-U.S. trade war continues to weigh on activity despite a flurry of policy support measures.

The government aims for economic growth of 6.0-6.5 percent in 2019.

On a quarterly basis, GDP in the first quarter grew 1.4 percent, as expected, but dipping from 1.5 percent in October-December. - Bloomberg"

The review adds another complication for Hyflux, which is under a court-supervised restructuring process, and recently had a rescue by an Indonesian investor called off, throwing its future into doubt.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and the Singapore Exchange Regulation together said on Tuesday they are ""reviewing Hyflux-related disclosure issues, as well as compliance with accounting and auditing standards.""

The review is ""to determine if there have been breaches of listing rules and/or the relevant laws and regulations,"" they said, without giving details or saying what prompted the review.

A spokeswoman for Hyflux Ltd, which operates an important water source for Singapore, told Reuters in an email that the company will be ""cooperating fully"" with their queries.

Hyflux has faced pressure to explain its disclosures since its debt restructuring began last May, said Ang Chung Yuh, a fixed income expert at investment platform iFast Corp in Singapore.

The Securities Investors Association of Singapore, representing security holders, had previously questioned how Hyflux's auditors signed off on its annual report just two months before it filed for court protection.

The association also queried how it was able to report profits prior to 2017 despite lacking cash.

Hyflux's debt stood at about S$1.67 billion ($1.2 billion) at the end of September.

Earlier this month, Hyflux said that a lifeline deal with its prospective Indonesian investor, SM Investments, had been terminated. On Monday, Hyflux took legal action against SM investments for abandoning the deal.

Hyflux's Tuaspring plant is the largest of three desalination plants in Singapore and an important water source for the city state.

PUB, Singapore's water agency, has warned Hyflux that it may take over the plant if the company does not fix its contractual defaults by April 30. - Reuters"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/singapores-ocbc-seeks-partner-for-china-securities-business/,Singapore's OCBC seeks partner for China securities business,Corporate News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",12:56 PM MYT,"SINGAPORE: Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. is looking for a Chinese firm to team up with on a securities joint venture on the mainland, the latest foreign bank seeking to capitalise on the nation’s financial-industry loosening.

Obtaining a Chinese securities license would allow OCBC to do asset management, investment banking and fund management business in the nation, Chief Executive Officer Samuel Tsien said in an interview in Singapore this week. Southeast Asia’s second-biggest bank by assets is talking to various firms that have shown an interest in such a partnership, he said.

“We will prefer to partner with companies that have a larger franchise already” so OCBC can sell into its existing client base, Tsien said, adding that the bank hasn’t applied for a licence yet.

Under President Xi Jinping, China is gradually taking steps to give foreign financial firms more access to the world’s second-largest economy. That’s prompted banks from Credit Suisse Group AG to JPMorgan Chase & Co. to seek a piece of the more than $40 trillion financial industry through controlling stakes in local ventures.

“For us, what we need is to be able to reach out to as many potential customers as we can” through a securities joint venture, Tsien said. Without extensive branch networks or a digital presence in China, “it’s very difficult for foreign banks to be able to reach out to them.”

UBS in December became the first foreign bank to gain majority control of a Chinese securities joint venture under new rules. JPMorgan and Nomura Holdings Inc. received their approvals last month.

Any Chinese joint venture would complement OCBC’s existing business in the country, which includes corporate, consumer and wealth banking.

Tsien said OCBC is on track to achieve a goal of doubling pretax profit in China’s Greater Bay Area to S$1 billion ($740 million) by 2023. “It’s possible that we’re able to beat that,” he said.

China is embarking on a sweeping plan to combine nine cities in the Pearl River Delta with Hong Kong and Macau -- a region known as the Greater Bay Area -- to create a financial and technology hub that could rival California’s Silicon Valley. OCBC plans to boost technology spending and staff in the region, Tsien said in June.

Still, Singapore will remain the most important market for the lender, even though Greater China has emerged as its second-largest location in the past two years, Tsien said. About 16 percent of OCBC’s revenue came from Greater China in 2018, compared with 58 percent from Singapore in the same year, according to its annual report.

Tsien also said:

OCBC will look at increasing its 20 percent ownership of China’s Bank of Ningbo Co. once regulators allow foreign banks to hold larger stakes in local lendersIf a global bank decides to exit the Asian wealth market, OCBC will be interested in looking at that firm’s assets.

Speaking on the business outlook, Tsien said the first half of the year will be “challenging” as market woes from 2018 continue to weigh on sentiment and business decisions. Loan growth is likely to slow and the bank will focus on regional trade finance, he said.

In the second half, “if those uncertainties were to be removed, then I think the investments will continue, and it will be a more conducive market for the banks to perform.” - Bloomberg"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/opec-risks-gambling-away-success-again-as-us$80-oil-looms/,Opec risks gambling away success again as US$80 oil looms,Oil & Gas,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",1:54 PM MYT,"LONDON: After managing to revive oil prices through production cutbacks, Opec now risks squandering its victory again by letting crude surge too high.

In the first quarter, coordinated production curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies helped oil rally the most in almost a decade, restoring prices to over us$70 a barrel.

Saudi Arabia, the group’s most powerful member, has made clear that it’s determined to keep supplies tight. That risks a repeat of 2018, when production cuts propelled oil to a four-year high, provoking a backlash from President Donald Trump and a hasty reversal by the kingdom.

“It appears that the producer group is over-tightening the market,” said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. in New York.

Opec and its partners launched a new round of output cuts at the beginning of the year when it looked like booming U.S. shale-oil production and fragile global demand growth would lead to a supply surplus. 

But as the group implements the curbs, and as supplies are squeezed further by crises in Venezuela and Iran, there’s now a greater risk of a shortage.

Supply Contraction

If the group continues with its cutbacks, global oil inventories will contract by almost 1 million barrels a day in the third quarter, the steepest drop in nearly two years, data from the organization shows. However, the group won’t make a decision whether to extend until it meets in late June.

The strain on markets could go even deeper. A conflict is flaring in Libya, output is plunging in Venezuela because of a spiraling economic crisis, and the U.S. will soon decide whether to tighten sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.

“Opec  is one major shutdown -- Libya, say -- from a very damaging price surge that throws all the plans out the window,” said Derek Brower, a director at consultant RS Energy Group.

That could easily send crude prices to levels that prompt disapproval from the White House, the Saudis’ most important political ally.

“There’s no doubt that in a scenario where Brent crude heads to $80, President Trump will voice his concern,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA.

Pursuing higher prices also risks straining the Saudis’ critical alliance with Russia, which is co-operating with Opec in the pact to curtail supply.

President Vladimir Putin said last week that he’s comfortable with current price levels, and that it’s too soon to decide whether output needs to be restrained in the second half.

To avoid a repeat of last year, Saudi Arabia could increase production slightly, stopping a surge in prices. The kingdom is cutting output by considerably more than required under the Opec accord, and so it could raise supplies without breaching the pact.

The Search For Balance

On April 8, less than two weeks after President Trump urged Opec to increase production, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said that his priority of “bringing back inventories to a reasonable level remains unchanged.”

Saudi Arabia faces powerful domestic pressures to press on with the policy, from Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s plans for radical economic transformation to a government budget that hinges on oil prices of $80 a barrel.

A year ago, Riyadh’s decision to let prices approach that level back-fired.

In April 2018, when oil was trading at about $70, the Saudis signaled at an Opec gathering in Jeddah they were comfortable allowing crude to climb even higher. 

Their stance provoked a furious response from President Trump, and though Riyadh initially brushed off his concerns, within two months they bowed to his wishes and raised production.

The kingdom subsequently bolstered output to record levels, flooding the market and sending prices crashing below $50 a barrel. The move was strongly influenced by U.S. promises to choke off Iranian shipments using sanctions, a pledge 

the Trump administration reneged on at the last minute.

This time, the Saudis are probably holding off on any action while they await a U.S. decision early next month on how to proceed with sanctions on Iran’s exports, Tchilinguirian said.

Regardless of Trump’s decision on Iran, with inventories set to shrink and supply losses looming elsewhere, the Saudis could face the same boom-and-bust outcome seen last year.

“Opec  has been very good lately at getting the market moving in the direction it wants, but less good at steering the market once it nears the destination,” said Brower. “It’s never really understood when to call time on a rally for its own good.” - Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/fitch-assigns-final-rating-of-a--to-resorts-world-las-vegas-debt-notes/,Fitch assigns final rating of A- to Resorts World Las Vegas debt notes,Corporate News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",2:35 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: fitch Ratings has assigned a final rating of 'A-' to Resorts World Las Vegas LLC's (RWLV, A-/Stable) senior secured US$1.2bil revolver* and US$400mil term-loan facilities due 2024 and the senior unsecured US$1bil 4.625% notes due 2029 issued by RWLV and its unit RWLV Capital Inc. 

The final rating on the loan facilities and notes is in line with expected rating assigned on March 21, 2019, and follows the receipt of final documents conforming to earlier information.

RWLV, an indirect unit of Genting Bhd  (Genting, A-/Stable), is building a US$4bil integrated resort on the Las Vegas strip. 

The rating agency said RWLV plans to finance a portion of the cost of construction and operation using proceeds from the facilities and notes. 

The project will be the first major Las Vegas property built in a decade and the third multibillion-dollar integrated resort opened by Genting after those in Malaysia and Singapore.

The Singapore integrated resort, Resorts World Sentosa,  will be undergoing a S$4.5bil redevelopment over five years, Genting Singapore (GENS) announced on April 3, 2019. 

“Fitch believes the plan will have a modest impact on Genting's consolidated leverage, which remains manageable within its current rating. 

“This is because Fitch believes Genting has the liquidity, leverage and free cash flow capacity to fund the development, and a track record of timing its capex to broadly match its operating cash flows, which helps the company to manage leverage during expansions,” it said. 

Fitch also said it believes that Genting has deleveraging capacity once Resorts World Las Vegas opens by end-2020, and that Genting Singapore will maintain a stable dividend payout during the period of high capex such that cash flows at Genting Overseas Holdings Ltd (GOHL, A-/Stable), will not be impaired. GOHL is Genting's unit, which effectively holds 52.7% of Genting Singapore. 

“However, any additional multibillion-dollar investments will likely delay Genting's deleveraging trajectory, and may constrain its ability to deleverage to below one time, the level at which Fitch would consider negative rating action,” it said.

* According to Investopedia a revolver refers to a borrower who carries a balance from month to month, through a revolving credit line. Credit issuers tend to profit handsomely from this model, because the open-ended credit line means revolvers will be paying off their debt obligations for extended periods of time.

Fitch -- Key rating drivers

Ratings Equalised with Parent: RWLV's ratings are equalised with those of Genting due to strong operational and strategic ties, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria.

 Genting's management exerts a high degree of control over RWLV's operations, funding and financial policy and has extended tangible financial support. 

RWLV's success is important for Genting to achieve its strategic objectives of growth and diversification, and negative regulatory action with respect to its licence in Nevada could affect its global operations.

RWLV also shares the brand name with the group's other resorts, highlighting the reputational risk for Genting.

Genting has injected equity of around USD1.2 billion into RWLV to date and will inject another USD700 million to help with construction and debt-service costs. 

Genting will sign a keepwell deed, which does not constitute a guarantee of RWLV's obligations, but rather provides an undertaking to maintain RWLV as its subsidiary. 

In addition, Genting, through GOHL, will sign a debt service funding agreement, which will cover RWLV's obligations during the construction phase and for two years after project opening, as well as a change order funding agreement, which will fund unforeseen cost increases until completion.

New Entrant in Mature Market: RWLV will be competing for market share against established players, such as Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS, BBB-/Positive), Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International (BB/Stable), in a  mature market. 

Genting expects its new, well-located and premium facilities and attractions, which will cater to both gaming and non-gaming visitors, will be preferred over those of competitors. 

RWLV will also count on the group's recognised brand, especially among Asians, and 12 million-member loyalty programme to drive growth. 

Gaming revenue for the Las Vegas strip has plateaued over the last four years, but non-gaming revenue continued to rise at a CAGR of 5% since 2011. Flat room supply since 2010 has also helped revenue per available room recover to close to the 2007 peak, after weakness in 2009-2010.

RWLV will be the first new property to open in the area in a decade and we expect initial visitation to be strong. 

Growth in visitors to Las Vegas should pick up, after moderating since 2017, driven by higher convention-centre capacity and a new football stadium, with support from Las Vegas' reputation as a top leisure destination. 

RWLV expects operations and earnings to stabilise within three years of start-up. 

We believe management's experience in the Las Vegas market mitigates execution risk, but the ramp-up of operations is likely to be more gradual than RWLV's expectations due to competitive pressure. We have reflected this in our assumptions.

RWLV to Drive Group Leverage: Around 70% of RWLV's USD4 billion budgeted project cost is scheduled to be spent in 2019-2020. Budgeted costs are higher than our assumptions by around USD1 billion due to changes in RWLV's development plan. 

RWLV had contracted over USD900 million of the project's USD2.8 billion guaranteed maximum price as of end-February 2019. 

Genting has included reasonable contingency in its budget and the risk of cost overrun is mitigated by the locking-in of pricing for key construction materials, such as steel and concrete. 

We estimate spending on RWLV to form over 60% of 

Genting's total capex of around MYR20 billion during 2019-2020, which is a significant increase from its annual capex and investments of around MYR6 billion in 2018 and MYR4 billion annually over 2014-2017. 

We expect that, as a result, Genting's leverage will increase to above 1.0x by 2020, but decline following the opening of RWLV. 

The group's record of prudent capital management supports our expectation. However, there is a risk that deleveraging may be delayed by subsidiary GENS's potential investment in Japan, which we have not included in our forecast in light of significant uncertainty.

Healthy Malaysian Operating Performance: 

The Malaysian government increased casino duty by 10 percentage points from 2019, which we estimate will cut Genting's EBITDA by around RM700 million annually. 

Genting is reviewing its marketing strategy and cost structure to mitigate the impact and we expect rationalisation of rebates and commissions and potential payroll reductions to provide cost benefits of at least RM100 million-RM200 million annually over the next three years. 

We also expect revenue growth, particularly from the non-gaming segment, with new facilities under the company's redevelopment masterplan at Resorts World Genting to drive visitor volume.

We see limited downside risk to our cash-flow forecast, despite lawsuits filed by Genting Malaysia, which owns Resorts World Genting, and Twenty-First Century Fox. 

This is because non-gaming revenue is a small contributor, at around 15% or less of Genting Malaysia's total revenue. 

Furthermore, the lawsuits affect only the outdoor theme park, while the other attractions, including a 400,000-square-foot indoor park, thematic virtual-reality experience and Ripley's Believe It or Not exhibits, have opened. 

We also believe our visitor growth estimates of around 10% in 2019 and 5% in 2020 remain reasonable relative to actual 9M18 visitor growth of around 14%."

Traders took profit from the shares which have rallied since the past week leading up to the confirmation of the mega project’s comeback last Friday.
Investors are also believed to be holding on to their stocks, hoping for more positive news such as the resumption of other mega projects such as MRT3 and the High Speed Rail (HSR).
Among key potential beneficiaries of ECRL,  IJM Corporation Bhd  closed 2.22% lower at RM2.20, while HSS Engineers Bhd went down 4.2% to RM1.14.
WCT Holdings Bhd  meanwhile closed 0.52% lower at 96 sen, Lafarge Malaysia Bhd  was down 2.04% to RM2.40 but Gabungan AQRS Bhd , which was in the red almost the entire day, managed to close at RM1.44, 1.41% higher.
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s statement yesterday that Malaysia will not build the HSR just yet also sent some stocks, perceived to be linked to the project –  southbound.
George Kent (M) Bhd  finished down 3.12% to RM1.22,  YTL Corp Bhd  closed 1.61% lower at RM1.22 while Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd  and Ekovest Bhd  also fell 2.11% and 2.54% to 93 sen and 57.5 sen respectively.
The construction index dropped 0.73% to 201.83 yesterday after rallying over 7% since the past week while the benchmark FBM KLCI also closed 1.87 points lower or 0.11% to 1,629.46.
A supplementary agreement inked between Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd and China Communications Construction Company Ltd to pave the way for the resumption of the project has raised participation of local players from 30% to 40%.
While the percentage is higher, the share of the pie for local players, as pointed out by Kenanga Research, is actually smaller at RM17.6bil with the new project cost of RM44bil as compared to the previous share of RM19.7bil at a contract cost of RM65.5bil.
It added that the actual civil work packages might be worth even lesser than RM17.6bil as the amount is an illustrative one based on total project cost.
“We remain less excited with the revival of ECRL as we have concerns on potential execution risk and thin margins that may not bode well for potential ECRL participants.
“We reiterate our ‘neutral’ call on the sector.
“Hence we recommend a top slicing strategy and we strongly believe that the sector’s re-rating catalyst is premised on the government’s direction on the future development plans like the potential continuation of MRT3 and HSR,” it said in a research note yesterday.
MIDF Research is of the opinion that while the news on ECRL is positive, it has to be recognised that expectations on its revival have already been priced in.
“This was reflective on the KLCON performance which was seen moving faster than its fundamentals, ahead of the announcements,” said the research house, which maintained its neutral call on the sector.
CGSCIMB retained its “underweight” stance, as the run-up in share prices of rail prices was on an average of 43% ahead of the project’s revival.
It also said that the main focus for new ECRL tenders would be the realignment from Mentakab to Negri Sembilan and Selangor that will provide a direct link from Kuantan Port to Port Klang. 
The research house added that the new southern alignment aims to leverage on the existing KLIA Express Rail Link and the upcoming MRT2 interchange in Putrajaya Sentral thus, underpinning ridership viability, which was in question previously.
UOBKayHian maintained its “market weight” call on the sector, as large-cap construction companies remain unexciting relative to selected small and mid caps in the sector."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/malaysia-on-ftse-russell-watch-list/,Malaysia on FTSE Russell watch list,Business News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is on the verge of being removed from the World Government Bond Index (WGBI), with local government bonds facing a potential rating downgrade, raising the risk of capital flight and increasing headwinds on the ringgit.
However, bond market pundits told StarBiz that Malaysia’s potential exclusion from the global index could be averted, if the government could address the concerns of index managers and raise market confidence.
Stock market indices provider FTSE Russell has placed Malaysia on the fixed income watch list for at least six months, following the completion of its first fixed-income country classification review.
“Malaysia, currently assigned a ‘2’ and included in the WGBI since 2004, is being considered for a potential downgrade to ‘1’, which would render Malaysia ineligible for inclusion in the WGBI,” said FTSE Russell in a statement yesterday.
FTSE Russell’s move to review Malaysian government bonds’ participation in the WGBI came a week after Norway’s US$1 trillion sovereign wealth fund was told to cut emerging-market government and corporate bonds, which includes Malaysia.
While the decision to add Malaysia on the watch list raises concerns in the domestic bond market, FTSE Russell stressed that it was “not a guarantee of future action”.
This means Malaysia could continue to remain on the WGBI and avoid a downgrade, if the country fulfils the WGBI eligibility criteria at the upcoming review in September 2019.
FTSE Russell also said that it would engage with local regulators and market participants in Malaysia to assess the potential changes to the country’s classification.
“Any WGBI inclusion or exclusion changes resulting from the review (in September), and the timetable for their implementation, would be announced shortly thereafter,” it said.Concerns of a potential downgrade of Malaysian government bonds, among other reasons, weakened the ringgit to RM4.1330 against the US dollar from RM4.1085 on Monday.The benchmark FBM KLCI declined by 0.11% or 1.87 points yesterday, while the trading volume and the value of the stocks traded on Bursa Malaysia fell to the lowest since March 28 due to general lacklustre interest.
In a research note yesterday, Citi Research pointed out that there was a chance for Malaysia to remain on the watch list for more than six months than initially expected.
During this period, discussions are expected to be held between index managers and government authorities.
According to Citi Research, Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) comprised 0.39% of WGBI as of March 2019 and the Government Investment Issues (GII) are not a part of the WGBI.
An estimated tracking of US$2 trillion in passive assets under management (AUM) would translate to an investment of US$7.8bil. For context, this is about 21% of the total foreign ownership of MGS and 8.3% of total outstanding MGS.
Citi Research said Malaysian bonds being in WGBI has been a meaningful source of foreign investment into MGS.
“AUMs tracking WGBI are mostly passive. This makes it unlikely for the investors to pre-empt any potential action by the index managers. Also important to note is that it is highly unlikely for any potential exit from the index to be sudden or disruptive
“On a precautionary note, we scale back our ringgit overlay from 2% to neutral and also scale back the overweight duration on Malaysian bonds to neutral in the emerging market bond portfolio,” stated the research house.
An expert on the Malaysian capital market acknowledged that there would be knee-jerk reaction following the decision by FTSE Russell to put Malaysia on the watch list.
However, he said that any negative reaction from the market would likely be temporary.
“Investors in the Malaysian bond market should not be worried about this unnecessarily. WGBI is not the only bond index provider, there are also others. I just hope the move by FTSE Russell won’t trigger other index providers to move in the same direction. Malaysian bonds are attractive in terms of liquidity,” he said.
In the first three months of 2019, Malaysian bonds enjoyed a strong surge in foreign purchase. The domestic bond market saw an inflow of RM5.1bil in the first quarter of 2019 (1Q19), which has offset equity outflows of RM1.3bil.
In comparison, foreign flows into the Malaysian bonds were only RM400mil in 4Q18.
An economist with a local bank told StarBiz that the government is expected to address FTSE Russell’s concerns during the review period.
“If the government’s response to the index managers is satisfactory, rest assured we would remain on the WGBI.”"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/chinas-home-prices-rise-faster-amid-lending-surge/,China’s home prices rise faster amid lending surge,Business News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",,"BEIJING: New home prices in China grew slightly faster in March after growth slowed the previous month, putting a floor under the cooling market, as Beijing rolled out stimulus to boost the economy.
The sector’s solid growth could cushion the impact of a vigorous multi-year government crackdown on debt and escalating trade tensions with the United States, although some analysts say bubble risks are rising as prices continue to climb.
Average new home prices in China’s 70 major cities rose 0.6% in March, quickening from a 0.5% gain in February, according to Reuters calculation of data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) yesterday.
On the whole, it logged the 47th straight month of price increases. Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS reported monthly price increases for new homes, and the number climbed sharply to 65 from 57 in February.
On an annual basis, home prices rose 10.6% in March, the highest since April 2017, and also accelerating from a 10.4% gain in February.
Consumer and business confidence have slipped in recent quarters in the face of slowing economic activity and the Sino-US trade dispute, as growth in the world’s second-biggest economy slumped to near three-decade lows last year.
As banks loosen lending standards and lower mortgage rates, buyers are returning to the market in anticipation of bigger price gains.
“Under the loosening credit policy, buyers are now rushing into the market for fear of missing out as some cities have experienced large price declines in the previous months,” said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with Hong Kong-based Centaline, a property consultancy.
Home prices in China are expected to rise more this year than predicted just a few months ago, a recent Reuters poll showed, as the government urges banks to raise lending and lower interest rates to support the economy.
Policymakers have been walking a tight rope between loosening some existing curbs and flushing out speculators in a market that directly influences 40 other business sectors in China and is key to tempering the economic slowdown.
But critics say Beijing’s pledge to defuse property speculation might have been compromised as banks issued far more loans in March than expected, heeding the government’s call to support struggling smaller companies and shore up the economy.
Medium- to long-term new household loans, mostly mortgages, totalled 460.5 billion yuan (US$68.6bil) in March, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data, up sharply from 222.6 billion yuan the previous month.
Tier-3 cities mainly led the firming streak in March. Home prices in those cities rose 0.7% from the preceding month, accelerating from 0.4 percent in February, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
The Chinese city of Dandong, which lies on the border with North Korea, was the top price performer in the month, with prices increasing 1.9% on a monthly basis.
Price growth in China’s four top-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou – rose 0.2% from a month earlier, slowing from a 0.3% gain in February. While prices in tier-2 cities, which include most of the larger provincial capitals, increased 0.6% in March on a monthly basis, compared with a 0.7% gain previously.
More recently, China’s state planner announced a scheme this month to ease residency curbs in small cities, amid a renewed push to accelerate urbanisation, which many analysts say would enable more out-of-towners to buy properties in the city, boosting property demand.
Some smaller cities have also quietly loosened curbs to prop up sentiment and demand, and Beijing appears to be showing a bigger tolerance as it emphasises on a “city-based” approach that gives local governments more autonomy in policymaking.
“Every time monetary policy has been eased since 2008, it brought house prices back up. Now with mortgage rates trending down, pent-up demand has been released and led to relatively significant gains in prices last month,” said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
Nie expects home prices to continue at the current trend rather than rise sharply compared with previous cycles, adding the government is still working to contain leverage ratios and a national programme to redevelop the country’s shanty towns is expected to be pushed back this year.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/vancouver-college-kids-living-like-kings/,Vancouver college kids living like kings,Business News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",,"TORONTO: Isaiah Boodhoo, 22, thought it was a “complete hoax” when he saw a rental listing on Facebook for a bedroom in a Vancouver mansion for only C$1,100 (US$825) a month.
It turned out the glass chandeliers, luxurious blue drapes, steam room and billiards table were for real. The nine-bedroom home, dubbed “The Castle” by the 14 students who share the property, is apparently owned by an Afghani pop artist, according to Boodhoo.
“Honestly, I would stay here for as long as I could,” he said, sitting on a white couch while sipping from a Slurpee cup. “US$1,000 bucks for all this?”
Others may also soon find themselves as lucky as more mansion owners in the city turn to renting to avoid a new tax on empty homes. In the new world of Vancouver’s housing market, where Chinese investors are decamping and low-ball offers are the norm, students can find themselves living in the lap of luxury.
It’s a far cry from the frenzy of a few years ago when the city was at the center of a global property boom. 
Prices more than doubled in the decade through 2016, outpacing gains in New York and London. 
But government policies to tame the market-from new taxes to stricter mortgage regulations-have fueled a plunge in sales to the weakest since the global financial crisis.
Prices are down 8.5% from their peak in June, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
The city boasts a thriving tech and tourism scene and sits in the province with the lowest unemployment rate in the country. But the sense of unease in the real estate market is palpable.
With taxes on an empty Vancouver home potentially adding up to 3% in annual levies, homeowners are rushing to lease their homes, according to real estate agents. That’s leading to bargains in a city where the vacancy rate has been near 0%.
“You have houses that are worth C$4mil renting for C$4,500,” said Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor whose popular real estate blog was pointing out cracks in the market even as benchmark prices peaked last year.
Prospective tenants are getting bold, said Kevin Wang, who runs a sales and rental real estate team with his twin brother Jerry. 
They’ve received calls from people offering to help with gardening or maintenance in exchange for free rent in a luxury home.
The owner of “The Castle” and the rental agency didn’t respond to requests for comment.
For his part, Boodhoo, not only has he scored luxury digs, he’s cut his commute time to his classes in music production to about 18 minutes from two hours.
“Everyday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I’m just like, that’s my house,” said Boodhoo, who’s looking forward to the pool in the backyard. It should be filled by June.
The Chinese seller
Lisa Sun paces around the Vancouver mansion she’s been hired to sell by its wealthy Chinese-Canadian owner. 
The family’s had it with the new taxes and what it sees as increasing hostility to Asian capital. Sun reckons that early last year the home would have easily sold for about C$8.5mil - holes in the wall and all.
Today, the 28-year-old realtor isn’t sure she’ll get a credible offer for the 8,343 sq ft mansion. 
These days a pool, wine cellar, and home theater on a prime lot aren’t enough to clinch a deal, even in West Vancouver, where opulent homes carved out of steep slopes overlook the ocean. 
Sun needs a “stager” to empty the house and brighten it up with new furniture, a modern chandelier, and lick of paint.
“I’ve been through only the peak, never the low,” said Sun as she schedules a makeover of the property. 
Pink tags indicate to the four cleaners what needs to be dumped.
The Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce in the garage, relatively unused for three years, also need to be dealt with.
The house is listed at C$10.9mil, but after receiving mostly low-ball offers closer to its tax-assessed value of C$6.2 mil, she’s planning on dropping the asking price closer to C$8.3mil.
That’s a hefty cut but holding on to the home would mean paying potentially more than C$140,000 in extra taxes annually for the Canadian owner who splits her time between Vancouver and Beijing. 
Canadian taxes are not the only measures weighing on the market. China’s capital controls are also limiting spending on global real estate.
Sun doesn’t think Vancouver’s market is going to come back to its highs, especially at the top end.

While the Zurich-based bank continued to dominate the regional top spot by a wide margin, with assets totalling US$357bil last year, Credit Suisse Group AG slightly narrowed the gap, the Hong Kong-based publication said on its website. UBS saw assets under management decline about 7%, while Credit Suisse’s assets edged up 1.5% to US$205bil.
UBS wasn’t the only firm to find its assets shrinking last year as market turbulence deterred rich clients from deploying their wealth. Across the industry in Asia, assets under management (AUM) “ground to a halt as challenging market conditions tempered activity and impeded performance,” APB said.
Total AUM at the 20 largest private banks in Asia excluding China declined 3.6% to US$1.63 trillion, with just five institutions seeing increases, according to APB. 
Relationship-manager headcount of these banks totalled 5,555, with expansion at firms including UBS, HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of Singapore. Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered Plc are among those to see lower staff numbers, the publication said.
Citigroup Inc, which held second place in 2017, was dropped from the annual ranking together with DBS Group Holdings Ltd, because the lenders’ numbers included assets of less wealthy clients, according to APB.
The survey only included private banks with minimum assets of US$1mil per customer. Those thresholds varied wildly for the firms on the list, from Goldman Sachs Group Inc catering to clients with at least US$100mil, followed by Morgan Stanley with US$35mil. At the other end of the spectrum, UBS’ minimum was US$2mil and Union Bancaire Privee SA’s was only US$1mil.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/orr-economic-risks-led-to-nzs-shift-to-dovish-stance/,Orr: Economic risks led to NZ’s shift to dovish stance,Business News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand’s central bank governor Adrian Orr said  an easing bias on interest rates will remain in place for now and that softer global economic conditions had contributed to the bank’s recent shift to a dovish policy tone.
At the last policy review in March, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) held the cash rate steady at 1.75%, but stunned markets by clearly stating that the next move in rates would likely be a cut.
“It remains, but it remains to be challenged by the data that we have seen,” Orr told Reuters in an interview when asked if the central bank is maintaining its easing bias.
Orr, a central bank veteran, took the helm at the RBNZ in March last year. He worked in the RBNZ’s economics department between 1997 and 2000, and later served as deputy governor for four years before joining the New Zealand Super Fund in 2007.
When he took charge 12 months ago, Orr said the central point for interest rates was 1.75%, but the broad centre of risk for the next move was to the upside.
On Tuesday, reflecting on the shifting economic conditions, the governor said “it’s been interesting watching that edge move away from the central to the downside.”
“We have no monopoly on wisdom....we were simply observing how everyone else were going and changing their positions. Some had biases up to neutral, some had neutral to down.” 
He said the US Federal Reserve was getting more nervous about the growth outlook, China’s economy was giving mixed signals while uncertainty dogged European policymakers and Britain continued to grapple with its plans to exit from the European Union.
“So the answer is, it got softer,” he said.
Orr said the RBNZ is still assessing data and broad economic conditions for the next interest rate decision on May 8, which would be the first to be delivered by a new monetary policy committee, rather than the governor alone.
“But it’s a good position to be in. If the next move is really difficult or uncertain, then it means you are in not too bad a position to begin with. If the next move is screamingly obvious then what are you doing here?”
Orr also said the New Zealand dollar is trading around a “happy space,” suggesting the central bank has no immediate concerns about the currency’s current value. 
The kiwi dollar eased back slightly to US$0.6757, from a top of US$0.6782 on Monday, mainly driven by a faltering Australian dollar.
New Zealand’s inflation edged up 0.1% in the fourth quarter on higher service costs, though the annual rate of 1.9% was still below the RBNZ’s target midpoint at 2%. Economic growth in the last quarter of 2018 rebounded, expanding 0.6% though still running below potential.
Speaking about inflation, Orr said any undershooting in the consumer price index data due to be released today has already been factored in.
“A lot of it has been factored in because really what you’re looking at is a long period of being surprised to the downside of CPI inflation so we’ve kind of re-centred and thought about that...,” he said. — Reuters"

Hektar Asset Management Sdn Bhd CEO Datuk Hisham Othman (pic), however, declined to divulge further information on the retail asset but reiterated that the Reit’s strategy is to own geographically diverse malls that are yield accretive. 
“This strategy has been proven well and the future malls that we acquire will most likely be situated outside the Klang Valley, as the Klang Valley is saturated with overbuilt malls or retail assets,” he said after the REIT’s AGM.
“We like malls that are market leaders in their locality, being the number one or only mall in town. 
“We are tapping on the stable purchasing power in smaller underserved cities by bringing in new local and international brands or retailers to the area,” he added.
Hektar REIT considers retail properties with yields of 6% to 7% to be acceptable.
Apart from that, Hektar REIT takes into consideration the ownership percentage, land title status and tenure of the retail assets it looks to acquire.
In 2018, rental reversions throughout the Reit’s portfolio amounted to 5.4%, through 160 new and renewed tenancies on 40.9% of the total net lettable area. 
As of December 2018, Hektar REIT’s portfolio maintained a high average occupancy rate of 92.1%, surpassing the average occupancy level of 85% for shopping centres in the Klang Valley.
Overall annual visitor traffic grew 9.2% to 32.1 million visits in 2018, driven by Central Square in Sungai Petani and Kulim Central, which have undergone refurbishment and asset enhancement initiatives (AEI) in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
Hektar REIT has allocated some RM30.5mil for Subang Parade’s AEIs, of which RM8mil is for the air conditioning and mechanical ventilation system, which resulted in a 34% average reduction in electricity consumption.
Going forward, Hektar REIT targets to reduce average energy consumption by 10% to 20% in its portfolio of malls by 2022.
At present, the REIT owns six shopping centres with two million sq ft of retail space, valued at a total RM1.2bil and catering to a market catchment of three million shoppers.
Net property income for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, rose 6.8% year-on-year to RM78.7mil, providing a dividend per unit yield of 8.1%."

However, he dare not say the market has bottomed out. 
“Regionally, all countries are not performing well. So it is good that the government is supporting the infrastructure sector,” he said, adding that he would be speaking more about the property market when he launched the full-year 2018 market report at the end this month.
Ahmad Zailan, who is also the president of Board of Valuers, Appraisers, Estate Agents and Property Managers (BOVAEP), was speaking to reporters after launching the updated 6th edition of the Malaysian Valuation Standards. 
The board’s chairman (test of professional competence) Datuk Siders Sittampalam said: “We don’t see how the market can further deteriorate. The market will sustain. It will remain at the current pace.”
Siders, who is also PPC International director, said there are external uncertainties and a general slowdown in the regional and global economy.
“The local property market cannot be looked at in isolation because it exists within the framework of the general economy although there is a lag time,” said Siders.
Two other valuers at the same event, however, are less sanguine.
Jordan Lee Jaafar Sdn Bhd executive director Yap Kian Ann said in view of the global uncertainties, the current stagnant market may continue for a further two to three years.
“Prices of residential have increased a lot over the past 10 years,” Yap said.
Terraced housing in some locations rose from about RM200,000 to RM700,000, a broad-based jump of 2.5 times but salaries did not rise by the same quantum. So there would be affordability issues, he said. 
Yap is of the view that the current bearish market would need a longer time to recover in view of the steep rise in prices over the past decade.
Unlike previous property cycles, prices did not rise as much and there was no issue on affordability.
“But I believe owners will have the holding power, which explains why we don’t see much fire sales,” Yap said.
VPC Alliance Sdn Bhd managing director James Wong said there were too many approvals for development over the years before the present government took over in May 2018. 
“We will have to wait for these approved projects to be absorbed by the market. So the gazetting of the Kuala Lumpur City Plan (KLCP)  2020 bodes well for the market,” Wong said.
Work on KLCP 2020 draft started in 1998 and after much deliberation, was finalised in 2012. However, it was not gazetted by the Barisan Nasional government.
The gazetting of the KLCP 2020 will determine what and how much can be build and where. 
Wong said this and other reforms and institutional changes should be viewed positively as it will put the country on a better footing over the longer term.

“Felda and Rajawali, or any subsidiary of Felda or Rajawali, are not or have never been engaged in any court proceeding,” Reuters quoted Rajawali as saying in a statement yesterday.
The statement came about after a Malaysian official last week said that Eagle High had decided to contest Felda’s decision to walk back on its acquisition of the stake in arbitration.
On April 8, Felda director-general Datuk  Othman Omar had lodged a police report at the police commercial crime unit, claiming that the firm was cheated into entering into a “one-sided” deal for the sale and purchase of Eagle High two years ago.
He claimed that the-then Prime Minister-cum-Finance Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, had directed Felda to invest in Eagle High through a 37% stake purchase.
This was revealed in a Finance Ministry letter to Felda dated Dec 8, 2015.
Othman said that the purchase of Eagle High, owned by Indonesian billionaire Tan Sri Peter Sondakh, the head of the Rajawali Group, was done through Felda’s special-purpose vehicle FIC Properties Sdn Bhd.
On April 11, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said that Felda would pursue its efforts to exercise the put option to sell back the 37% equity stake in Eagle High to Rajawali.
Felda, said Mohamed Azmin, had filed a notice to Eagle High last year to exercise the put option to sell back its 37% stake in Eagle High to Rajawali. However, the request, according to him, was rejected.
“This is proof that it does not have the financial capability to pay Felda’s cost of investment in Eagle High,” he said.
In April 2017, Felda completed the purchase of a 37% stake in Eagle High from Rajawali for US$505.4mil, which was reportedly  higher than the valuation by two independent appraisers on the company of US$264mil and US$404mil, respectively.
The deal came with a put option that supposedly allows Felda to sell back the stake to Rajawali with an annual 6% gross return."

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/shahril-not-reducing-stake-in-sapura-energy/,Shahril not reducing stake in Sapura Energy,Business News,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The 600 million shares or 3.76% stake in Sapura Energy Bhd  that was sold off by Sapura Technology Sdn Bhd, the investment vehicle of Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin (pic) and family, was actually excess shares, and not shares of their own core shareholding. 
Thus, Shahril and family are not reducing their stake in the company, but merely selling off the excess shares from the underwriting portion of the RM4bil rights issue that was completed in January. 
Sapura Technology remains the second-largest shareholder of Sapura Energy with a 12.55% stake. 
Furthermore, Shahril, who is group CEO of Sapura, has been granted an additional 798.95 million employee share option scheme  (Esos) shares, equivalent to a 5.01% stake in Sapura. These shares come at a weighted average exercise price of 30 sen. 
The Esos shares were part of Permodalan Nasional Bhd’s (PNB) strategy to motivate management to grow the company. PNB is the single largest shareholder in Sapura Energy with a 40% stake. 
Shahril has three years to exercise this call option of Sapura shares. “Recall that when Sapura’s rights issue was being done, one underwriter pulled out at the last minute because Brent oil had fallen from the US$86 level to about US$54 by end-December. This resulted in CIMB Investment Bank and RHB Investment Bank joining Maybank Investment Bank as the main underwriters for the rights issue,” said a source. 
This also resulted in the Shamsuddin family underwriting one block of shares. 
“In fact, you can see that the shares that were sold came from a pledged account. They took a loan for this underwritten portion. These excess shares were only meant to be held temporarily. The shares were held in Maybank Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd pledged securities account for Sapura Technology,” added the source. 
Sapura Energy closed 0.5 sen down yesterday to 33 sen on a volume of 81.77 million shares. 
Meanwhile, the 600 million shares or the 3.76% stake in Sapura was sold off via off-market transactions at 31 sen, and was taken up by a few domestic funds, said the source.
“At 31 sen, this is almost a 9% discount to its market price of 34 sen, which is attractive. The funds are also of the opinion that the worst is over for Sapura,” said the source.  
On Monday, investors sold down shares in Sapura Energy after news emerged that the company’s second-largest shareholder, Sapura Technology, had sold 600 million shares, or 3.76%, in the group. The 600 million shares consisted of 360 million shares last Tuesday and another 240 million shares on Wednesday.
The shares fell despite the group bagging RM1.3bil in contracts in engineering, construction and drilling last Friday. 
This caused investors to question the reasoning for the major shareholder to be selling down its stake when the company appeared to be on a better footing. 
Sapura Energy completed its rights issue in January, but all was not smooth. The rights issue was under-subscribed by 18.5%. 
At that time, the bearishness on Sapura was at its highest, with many thinking that Sapura’s share price would face further pressure upon the listing of the rights shares. 
The remaining unsubscribed rights shares were fully taken up by the joint-underwriters, namely, Maybank, CIMB and RHB.
Surprisingly, though, when the rights shares were listed, Sapura’s share price did not tank - in fact it started inching upward. With a stronger balance sheet combined with new contracts being announced, investors began to turn positive on the stock’s future prospects. 
Last Friday, Sapura announced it had secured several contracts and contract extensions worth RM1.3bil. The contracts secured were for its drilling as well as engineering and construction segments. This brings its total contract wins for the current financial year to RM18.5bil from RM17.2bil in March.
PNB remains the single largest shareholder in the company with a 40% stake."

Beijing has stepped up fiscal stimulus to prevent a sharper slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, which is being squeezed by weaker domestic demand and a trade war with the United States.
Local governments will be allowed to issue 2.15 trillion yuan (RM1.326 trillion) worth of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects, a jump of 59% from last year.
S&P Global Ratings estimated last year that local governments were already sitting on hidden debt that could be as high as 40 trillion yuan.
“Infrastructure stimulus could lift growth over the projection horizon, but it could lead to a further build-up of imbalances and capital misallocation, and thereby weaker growth in the medium term,” the OECD said in its latest survey on China’s economy.
“The stimulus risks increasing once again corporate sector indebtedness and, more generally, reversing progress in deleveraging,” it said.
China’s corporate debt has fallen to about 160% of gross domestic product (GDP) due to a multi-year clampdown on riskier types of financing and debt, but the level was still higher than in other major economies, the OECD said.
The government in March announced tax and fee cuts of two trillion yuan for companies this year, which will lift its budget deficit to 2.8% of GDP this year from 2.6% in 2018.
China’s fiscal stimulus could be as high as 4.25% of GDP this year, up from 2.94% in 2018, the OECD added. — Reuters"

Wall Street's S&P 500 gave up nearly all of its earlier gains as healthcare shares fell after UnitedHealth Group Inc discussed concerns about U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" plan, as well as the White House's proposal to end discounts from drugmakers.

""In healthcare, there is concern over various single-payer plans, which could damage the health insurance industry,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""That thesis slowly worked its way into the sector today, and aggressive selling begets more selling.""

Even though Wall Street stocks treaded water, an advance in Chinese and European shares helped push the MSCI world equity index to a six-month high. Positive data, including a quicker pace of growth in Chinese home prices and improving sentiment among German investors, bolstered global equities.

The latest leg higher in this year's global rally comes as a degree of calm has descended across financial markets. European stock volatility reached its lowest level since January 2018, while on Wall Street, the CBOE Volatility Index hit its lowest level in more than six months.

The U.S.-China trade dispute, signs of slowing global corporate earnings and fears about an economic downturn have weighed on riskier assets in the past year. But investors have been quick to seize on positive news to keep the bull market running.

Among the information investors are anticipating is Chinese quarterly economic growth data, due on Wednesday. After a worrying start to the year, Chinese numbers have been more positive as authorities ramped up stimulus measures, soothing investor fears about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.

""The improvement in China data has been something of a lifeline,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""When the Chinese economy moves in one direction, usually the European economy follows with a lag.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 67.89 points, or 0.26%, to 26,452.66, the S&P 500 gained 1.48 points, or 0.05%, to 2,907.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.21 points, or 0.3%, to 8,000.23.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.16%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended 0.3% higher.

As stocks advanced, U.S. Treasury yields rose to four-week highs. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.5904%, from 2.553% late on Monday.

Even during this year's rally in stocks, ""the flight-to-quality bid in Treasuries had not subsided,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Now we're starting to see the beginning of that, and that's pushing yields higher.""

Spot gold prices dropped to their lowest level this year and were last down 0.9% as risk appetite dented demand for the precious metal's safe-haven credentials.

In currency markets, the euro dipped after Reuters reported that some European Central Bank policymakers doubt whether growth will rebound in the euro zone as projected. The currency was last down 0.2% at $1.1282.

Sterling slipped 0.4% to $1.3049 after the Guardian newspaper reported that talks between Prime Minister Theresa May and the opposition Labor Party regarding Britain's exit from the European Union had stalled. The Labor Party denied the report.

The dollar index ticked up 0.1%.

Oil rose as fighting in Libya and declining Venezuelan and Iranian exports raised expectations of tightening global supply.

The companies also said in a joint statement that they had reached a six-year license agreement and a multiyear deal for Qualcomm to supply Apple with modem chips.Qualcomm had claimed Apple was violating its patents by withholding royalties, while Apple argued Qualcomm had been overcharging for those patents for years, abusing its dominant position in the market. At stake was the future of Qualcomm’s licensing model and billions of dollars in royalties that Apple has either paid or kept. Until the settlement was struck, Qualcomm had lost more than $25 billion in market value amid the looming threat.The emergence of fifth-generation wireless speeds as a key component of coming devices likely drove the two companies to the table. Apple’s most recent iPhones have been using modem chips from Intel Corp. , which has lagged behind Qualcomm in providing wireless features. Apple also faced falling behind rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. in offering speedier wireless devices.Determining exactly who benefits by how much is difficult because the companies didn’t divulge pricing or other terms of the licensing and supply deals. Qualcomm said the agreement will add about $2 in annual earnings per share as modem-chip shipments begin."

Shares of the company fell about 2.85 percent to $141 in trading after the bell.

Under Ginni Rommetty's stewardship, the company has shed many of its traditional hardware businesses and beefed up the growth areas through deals such as its $34 billion deal for Red Hat Inc, by far the company's biggest acquisition.

The company returned to annual revenue growth after seven years in the last quarter of 2018, triggering expectations that its strategy was taking roots.

Shares of the technology services giant have gained about 18 percent since Jan.22, when it reported its fourth-quarter results.

The company's revenue slipped 4.7 percent to $18.18 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 and missed analysts' average estimate of $18.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue from four of its business segments fell year-over-year and all of them except the cloud unit missed FactSet revenue estimates.

Its cloud and cognitive segment, which includes analytics, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, fell 1.5 percent to $5.04 billion, but beat FactSet estimates of $4.18 billion.

The three blocks will add about 2.6 million net acres to Exxon's existing holdings in Argentina, the company said. The blocks are located in the Malvinas basin, about 200 miles (320 kms) offshore Tierra del Fuego.

Exxon's existing Argentina holdings include 315,000 net acres spread over seven blocks in the onshore Neuquén Basin of the Vaca Muerta unconventional oilfield and a business support center in Buenos Aires.

ExxonMobil will have a 70 percent stake, while Qatar Petroleum's affiliate will hold the rest.

The Argentine government issued a statement on Tuesday saying it received offers for the exploration of three offshore oil and gas basins from 13 companies for a total of $995 million. The country's energy secretariat was expected to confirm which companies were awarded which areas next month.

Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with Exxon Mobil in June to buy a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon's affiliates in Argentina, giving Qatar's state-owned entity access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country.

Exxon has been investing heavily in its U.S. shale operations and in Guyana. Its development in Argentina has been slow due to several reasons, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government controls on natural gas prices.

The U.S. oil company also invested in Brazil's prolific offshore oilfields throughout 2018, clinching numerous blocks in partnership with other companies. Exxon and Qatar Petroleum International landed Brazil's Tita area, locking in key real estate in the prized Santos basin.

GenM had previously written off its RM1.8bil investment in its Mashpee notes in its 3Q18 results owing to a court ruling that the tribe did not meet certain requirements to allow it to have a tract of land in trust for an integrated gaming resort development.

In Florida, the state is negotiating with the Seminole Tribe on their “exclusive” rights to offer banked card games in the state, which contributed USD$350m/year to the state.

“ASK (available seat kilometres) is expected to grow at 9.8% and RPK (revenue passenger kilometres) at 10.1% backed by load factors of 84.7%. Subdued fuel prices would help support earnings. 

“Ancillary income would also grow as AAGB ramps up REDCargo and AirAsia.com.  The ancillary business contributed 20% to group revenue in FY18 and has potential to grow.

The stock fell to a low of 46 sen during the day before recovering to close at 48 sen yesterday. 
On the previous day, the stock had lost seven sen or 11.7% in a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement.
It was reported on Monday that Prestariang had named the government as defendant in a RM732.86mil legal claim in relation to the cancellation of the RM3.5bil national immigration control system (SKIN) project.
In a filing with the stock exchange, the group said its subsidiary, Prestariang SKIN Sdn Bhd (PSKIN) had decided to take the government to court after failing to reach a settlement following several rounds of negotiations.
This follows the government’s unilateral termination of the project by way of expropriation in January this year.
The sum it is seeking, Prestariang said, was calculated based on the contractual formula provided in the 15-year concession agreement (CA) it had entered into with the government back in August 2017.
PSKIN, in August 2017, had secured the 15-year concession to design, deliver, continuously maintain and provide scheduled upgrades for a new and improved immigration and border control system for the Immigration Department.
The new system was to replace the existing Malaysian Immigration System.
It was agreed that PSKIN would receive about RM3.5bil over the 15-year period.
However, the group, via a letter from the Home Ministry in December last year, was informed of the Cabinet’s decision to terminate the project, with the termination taking effect the following month.
The news sent the share price of Prestariang plunging close to six-year lows, hitting a low of 26.5 sen.
Since then, the share price recovered significantly, moving up to a high of 63.5 sen just last week.
News of the legal claim, announced on Tuesday, however, has once again impacted the stock.
CGS-CIMB Research said yesterday that the news was a negative surprise as it had previously expected both parties to come to an agreement on the compensation for Prestariang.
It added that the RM732.8mil compensation sought by PSKIN was much higher than its estimate of RM520mil, which is the net present value of the availability charges (similar to power purchase agreements).
“However, we do not have the finer details of the concession agreement,” the research house said.
At RM732.8mil, it said the compensation to Prestariang, which owns a 70% stake in PSKIN, would be RM513mil or RM1.06 per share.
The research house noted that based on the CA, the government is required to pay the full compensation amount by July 19, 2019.
“However, Prestariang’s legal case against the government of Malaysia may be a long drawn affair.
“We are also unsure if there would be any negative impact on its other businesses with the government, like the MLA3.0 project,” it said.
The MLA3.0 is a contract for the sale of Microsoft software to the government’s agencies nationwide, which runs from February 2018 to January 2021."

Lufthansa shares fell as much as 5% at the open in Frankfurt after the country’s biggest carrier disclosed an adjusted loss before interest and taxes of 336mil euros (US$380mil). 
The downturn, which compared with earnings of 52mil euros a year earlier, was particularly stark because of strong results for the beginning of last year following the collapse of Air Berlin, the airline said in a statement on Monday.
The loss comes after Lufthansa opted to pare planned capacity increases this summer to bolster prices and focus on profitability. The European airline industry is coming off a tough year, with bad weather and air-traffic-control strikes among the factors hurting profit. Irish low-cost giant Ryanair Holdings Plc has warned that fares will remain depressed.
Analysts at Bernstein said Lufthansa’s first-quarter setback will “test investor patience” coming soon after the company reported results in February and it isn’t clear whether the carrier’s underlying business has suffered in recent weeks due to fare competition.
“None of this should be surprising -- but the magnitude of the miss is,” the analysts said in a research note yesterday
Lufthansa’s fuel bill rose by 202mil euros in the first quarter, in line with a company forecast for increases of 200mil euros in each of the first three quarters.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also sees the likelihood of a higher cash rate in the near-term as low, marking a dovish turn in policy compared to last month when it saw the risks for rates to move in either direction as more evenly balanced.
Minutes of its April policy meeting released yesterday showed members acknowledged the effect of an even lower cash rate on the economy could be smaller than in the past given high household debt and crumbling property prices.
“Nevertheless, a lower level of interest rates could still be expected to support the economy through a depreciation of the exchange rate and by reducing required interest payments on borrowing, freeing up cash for other expenditure,” the minutes showed.
The dovish slant sent the Australian dollar down a third of a US cent to the day’s low of US$0.7140.
The change in the RBA’s language also lengthened the odds for an easing later this year with a full 25-basis-point cut expected by October.
“The minutes of the RBA’s April meeting suggest that it won’t take much for the bank to cut interest rates,” said Marcel Thieliant, Singapore-based senior economist at Capital Economics. 
“We expect the RBA to cut the cash rate to 0.75 percent by early next year, starting in August.” - Reuters"

“The only export that is affected is palm oil while other sectors so far have not shown any negative effect,” he said at a briefing on the upcoming International Sourcing Programme (INSP) at SEMICON Southeast Asia.
According to Matrade’s data, trade with the EU in February decreased by 5.7% year-on-year to RM13.35bil or 10.9% of Malaysia’s total trade.
Exports to the EU recorded growth of 3.7% to RM7.68bil, attributable to higher exports of manufactured goods primarily E&E products, manufactures of metal, machinery, equipment and parts as well as palm oil-based manufactured products.
From the overall trade, compared with February last year, exports of E&E products increased by 4.9% valued at RM25.81bil, which constituted 38.8% of total exports.
“Among the top 10 EU markets which accounted for 89.7% of Malaysia’s total exports to the EU were Spain, which recorded an increase of 78.4%, Ireland (180.1%), Italy (28.2), Germany (1.1%), France (3.6%) and the Czech Republic (2.5%),” he said.
Wan Latiff added that Malaysia’s strength in the E&E sector, especially as the region’s top player, is expected to grow at a steady pace despite the global slowdown, with the adoption of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0.
“I believe that we will be able to have a stronger footprint in the industry and the E&E sector will continue to play an important role in Malaysia’s economy. By 2020, the industry is expected to generate an additional gross national income of RM53.4bil and create 157,000 new jobs,” he said.

Handal, in a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, said it had entered into an agreement with Seaoffshore Capital Sdn Bhd (SOC) to buy a 51% stake in Borneo Seaoffshore Engineering Sdn Bhd (BSOE).
SOC owns a 14.85% stake in Handal.
To pay for the acquisition, Handal will issue 42.86 million new shares at 37 sen each, as well as 26.06 million irredeemable convertible  preference shares, also at 37 sen each.
“The proposed acquisition will allow Handal to immediately expand its service offerings to its existing clients due to the similar business nature of both Handal and BSOE, which is in the provision of maintenance services for the upstream O&G sector,” Handal said.
The company said BSOE has been generating profits for the past two years up to the audited financial year ended June 30, 2018.
The proposed acquisition comes with a profit guarantee of RM5mil, of which RM2.55mil is attributed to Handal based on its 51% equity interest."

On  April 3, GenS announced a hefty S$4.5bil (RM13.74bil) expansion of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS). The Singapore government on the same day also announced the imposition of higher entry levies and gaming taxes, to take effect on April 4 and in March 2022 respectively. 
GenS plans to mainly finance the S$4.5bil expansion of RWS via internal funds.
The hefty investment will, however, inflate Genting’s already massive capex commitments, estimated at above RM20bil over the next two to three years, thus adding pressure to the group’s financial profile, the ratings house said in a statement yesterday.
Genting also faces the prospect of reduced earnings contribution from GenM’s Resorts World Genting (RWG) following the steep hike in Malaysian gaming taxes, it added. 
Still, it said, despite the spike in Genting’s capex commitments due to RWS’ expansion, it is partly comforted by the group’s staggered timeline. 
RAM said it anticipates greater clarity on the potential impact of these developments when it conducts its annual review of the group, which is envisaged to be completed in June. 
Genting carries respective global-, Asean- and national-scale corporate credit ratings of gA2/stable/gP1, seaAAA/stable/seaP1 and AAA/stable/P1, underpinned by its strong business positions in the Malaysian, Singaporean and UK gaming markets, according to RAM."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/17/boring-prospects-for-malaysian-stock-market/,Boring prospects for Malaysian stock market,Markets,"Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019",,"SINGAPORE: Hopes of luring back global investors to a battered stock market are dimming by the day for Malaysia.
The benchmark FBM KLCI is down 14% from a record in May 2018 and it’s the worst major market in the world so far this year, having slipped 3.4%.
That’s even amid a rally in global equities spurred by the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot and a potential trade deal between the United States and China.
The gloomy outlook for Malaysian stocks isn’t likely to end anytime soon, says Samsung Asset Management Co.
“Malaysia will likely disappoint over the next year because since the new government came in power in May 2018, it has been lowering public debt with fiscal tightening,” said Alan Richardson, a regional fund manager at Samsung Asset in Hong Kong. “This will be the theme from May 2018 to May 2020.”
Euphoria about Malaysian stocks has faded after almost one year since Pakatan Harapan’s surprise election victory in May, as the new administration struggled to clean up government inefficiencies and corruption. Unfulfilled campaign promises partly due to the legacy it inherited have also hurt its popularity. The new administration last month lowered its 2019 economic growth forecast and has been on an austerity drive to rein in its budget deficit.The stocks gauge fell to its lowest since 2016 last week even as the price of crude oil, one of its major exports, has risen by a third in 2019.
“The perception that Malaysia is the only beneficiary in Asia from rising oil prices is a fallacy,” Richardson said. “Rising oil price is negative for Malaysia” because it imports more oil products than what it exports as crude, he said.
Foreign investors have dumped Malaysian shares worth more than a net US$500mil (RM2.07bil) so far this year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Malaysia’s central bank in March pledged to keep monetary policy accommodative as global risks weigh on the trade-reliant economy.
Not everyone is bearish. Bharat Joshi, a Jakarta-based fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is “neutral” on Malaysia stocks and sees green shoots in infrastructure and oil-related stocks.Construction shares and oil and gas stocks will outperform the market following the resumption of talks on projects including the East Coast Rail Link and a rebound in commodity prices, he said.
However, Joshi and Richardson shared a view that the weak performance of the new government and companies have weighed on sentiment so far.
Richardson said he is bearish on Malaysia stocks not because there is a downside risk, but “just that there is nothing to be positive about over the next 12 months.” — Bloomberg"

AmInvestment Research is maintaining its buy call with unchanged forecasts and sum-of-parts-based (SOP) fair value of RM6.50 a share, which implies an FY19F PE of 20 times or 33% below Dialog’s 30 times, the company’s closest peer in Malaysia. 

It said on Wednesday Serba Dinamik’s foreign debt accounts for 40% of gross debt of RM1.7bil as at Dec 31, 2018, of which RM496mil (US$120mil) is scheduled to be repaid this year. 

“Hence, the group is earmarking US$80mil to US$130mil for engineering, procurement and construction projects in Laos, Tanzania and Uzbekistan, as well as working capital for Middle Eastern operation and maintenance contracts.

“While the group has already issued a RM800mil sukuk programme in October last year and retained the outstanding proceeds of RM419mil from its RM407mil IPO in February 2017 and RM427mil private placement in January 2018, this new foreign-denominated debt issue circumvents the conversion of the ringgit, which requires Bank Negara approval,” it said.

 S&P Global Ratings has assigned a preliminary ”BB-"" rating for long-term issuer credit and guarantees. 
Fitch Ratings has accorded a long-term issuer default rating of ”BB-” with a stable outlook. 

These could mean an interest rate of 5.5%, higher than Serba’s average gross interest rate of 5.1% in FY18. 

“We are neutral on this development, which is part of the group’s financing programme for international expansion. 

“While net gearing has risen to 0.45 times as at 4QFY18 from 0.29x in 4QFY17 due to the pipeline of multiple projects, management reaffirms that Serba Dinamik does not require any equity-raising exercise. 

“Management expects the continuation of strong revenue growth this year driven by growing demand in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, spearheaded by the UAE and Qatar,” AmInvest Research said. 

Most of the growth will be underpinned by Serba Dinamik’s operation and maintenance services, which account for 89% of the group’s FY18 revenues.  

Serba Dinamik is currently trading at a grossly undervalued FY19F PE of 12 times versus over 30 times for Dialog Group .

The Apple Inc supplier booked a January-March loss of 132 billion won ($115.6 million) versus a loss of 98 billion won in the same period a year earlier.

The result - which came after two consecutive quarters of profit - compared with a forecast for an average 104 billion won loss calculated from 13 analyst estimates compiled by I/B/E/S Refinitv data.

Revenue rose 4 percent on year to 5.9 trillion won.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/24/tnb-phenomenal-role-as-catalyst-of-national-development/,TNB’s phenomenal role as catalyst of national development,Corporate News,"Wednesday, 24 Apr 2019",10:49 AM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: Tenaga Nasional Bhd  (TNB) has come a long way since its establishment in 1949 as the Central Electricity Board (CEB) to become the catalyst of national development.


TNB, which is celebrating its 70th anniversary in September this year, has undergone several major transformation, including rebranding as the National Electricity Board (LLN) in 1965, privatisation in 1990 and corporatisation in 1992.


Chairman Tan Sri Leo Moggie said TNB has grown from strength to strength throughout the years, especially the period of demand boom for power supply since 1980s.


""TNB has grown matured for the last 70 years, has made major contributions to the development of the country and internally has also adjusted itself to be relevant at every stage of development in technology and every stage development of the country,” he told Bernama in an interview.


He said as with economic growth, the demand for electricity grew in tandem but TNB remained steadfast in delivering its duty as the sole electricity distributor in the country.


""We recorded the highest demand of electricity at 18,566 megawatt (MW) a few days ago as compared to 1978/1979 when the highest demand at that time was averaging 1,260 MW,” he said.


He said despite the surge in electricity demand, the electricity industry still has about 20 per cent of reserve margin to cover unexpected power generator plants breakdown.


Moggie said TNB has elevated the quality of electricity supply in the country as measured via the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), a methodology used by the electricity industry worldwide to measure the length of time each consumer experiences power disruption in a year.


""TNB’s SAIDI record now 48 minutes and we are proud of it. We are better than the UK,” he said.


In comparison, SAIDI in England was 55 minutes last year, France (60 minutes), Ireland (90 minutes) and Australia (125 minutes,) while neighbouring country, Thailand has a SAIDI of 60 minutes.


He said another benchmark is Transmission System Minutes which measures the minutes of interruption caused by transmission per year whereby the company recorded less than a minute for 2018, a record that is comparable to developed nations.


""What it reflects is our transmission network is now actually quite efficient,” he said.


On people’s perception that TNB is monopolising the power industry, Moggie said such misconception derived from TNB’s role as the sole distributor of electricity in the country.


""In most countries, the main transmission network always seems to be a natural monopoly, which is managed usually by the regulated government agency,” he said.


However, he said the power generation industry in the country is open for participation to others known as the independent power producer (IPP) which was introduced in the early 1990s.


""TNB generation capacity on its own amounted to only about 49 per cent, while 51 per cent is actually generated by IPPs and then sold to TNB as single buyer on a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA),” he said.


He said the PPA is a long-term deal based on two components -- capacity charge and energy charge.


""Capacity charge is meant to allow the recouping of the capital investment on building a power plant, while energy charge is based on the fuel (gas or coal) price that is utilised to generate power, depending on the movement of the fuel price internationally,” he said.


He said the participation of the IPPs in the industry has helped to grow the industry and made it more competitive.


Moggie said other countries had introduced a more open system called merchant market where the contract period is shorter and interested companies can build power plant and sell it to the utilities that transmit and sell to the consumers in a very competitive environment.


""The risk there is new investors may not be prepared to put investment on new generating capacity without an assurance from the market and subsequently they go back to use the PPA,” he said.


He said the presence of the PPA gives potential investors the confidence in building new capacity because of assurance in return on investment.


Moggie also argued on the idea of completely liberalising the electricity supply, citing such move may not immediately leads to reduction in electricity prices as evidenced in the UK and other European countries.


""When the UK and other European countries started liberalising electricity supply, there was a slight increase in consumer bill.


""So, complete liberalisation may not immediately lead to reduction in price but there is a risk that it might increase,” he said.


He said another issue that would arise from completely liberalising the electricity supply would be on managing cross subsidy provided to the industry.


Without a proper way of managing the cross subsidy, it could be misused to benefit only a portion of the population, he added.


Going forward, he said TNB is preparing itself in anticipation of technology and market change.


""At TNB, we are already preparing ourselves in the last two years to ensure that our structure is ready when this change is going to happen. We called this programme ‘Reimagining TNB’,” he said.


He said the company has introduced smart metre that can be read remotely and allowed consumers to manage their consumption.


Moggie said TNB is also engaging the smart grid network to facilitate the increase injection of green renewable energy into the network.


Apart from that, he said TNB has also set up the retail division to manage consumers’ expectations.


""They (retail division) have to be very conscious of consumers’ expectations and their (consumers) expectations are very high.


""That is why we think at TNB level, we are as prepared as we should be and our experience in adapting to the expectations of the consumer market over the years will give us the confidence,” he said.


He also anticipates that the energy demand would grow at a slower pace in the coming years as the country’s economy is maturing and focusing more on the services sector compared to the manufacturing sector.


""Our projection is that demand will still increase but the rate of increase will not be as fast as it used to be. Before this, it used to be at four to five per cent but now it is less than two per cent,” he said.


He added that another factor contributing to the slower pace of demand growth would be consumers adopting to smart systems that stressed on energy efficiency.


To date, TNB transmission lines stretched over 6,300 kilometres, while its customer-base has reached 9.6 million, including in Sabah where it owns 83 per cent of Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd. - Bernama"

The Singapore-based firm has overstated sales and profit in China, Matthew Wiechert’s Bonitas said in the report, which was based on on-the-ground research on the Chinese mainland. Bonitas believes that Best World’s “Chinese sales are a fraction of what was reported to shareholders,” it said.

Best World wasn’t immediately available to comment. The firm received a query on trading activity from Singapore Exchange after shares dropped as much as 11 percent. Trading was then halted after a request from the company, pending the release of an announcement.

Best World is the most-shorted stock in Singapore, with short interest standing at 13 percent of the free float as of April 22, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. Short interest as a percentage of the free float has almost doubled this month, the data show.

Best World said in February that it conducts “all areas of its business ethically and in compliance with applicable laws and accounting standards,” in response to a report in the Business Times that said it was “challenging to figure” where in China the company is selling its DR’s Secret line of premium skincare products. 

Best World also said it had appointed an independent auditor to review and address issues raised in the report.

Analysts have had concerns about the stock. DBS Bank Ltd.’s Carmen Tay suspended coverage in August, citing “limited visibility on underlying consumption trends under the new Franchise model” in China. 

CLSA Ltd.’s Horng Han Low maintained a sell rating in a report early this month, saying there is a “significant gap between consumer interest and revenue” in China.

Best World shares have tumbled 32 percent this year through Tuesday’s close after almost doubling in 2018. Of four analysts covering the stock, three recommend selling, while one has a buy rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bonitas, which Wiechert started after parting ways with Glaucus Research co-founder Soren Aandahl last year, previously published short reports on stocks in Hong Kong including Chong Sing Holdings FinTech Group Ltd., Hengan International Group Co., and Hosa International Ltd.

Chong Sing lost about 85 percent of its value through Tuesday’s close since Bonitas questioned the company’s financial reporting in September and said the stock was worth zero. 

Hengan, however, gained almost 20 percent since the short seller said in December that its shares were worth “close to zero.” Both companies strongly denied the allegations made in the reports. - Bloomberg"

In a statement Wednesday, the offshore energy facilities and service provider said the loans would be repayable over two and five years respectively, from the closing date of the facility agreement. 

The closing of the facility agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent which are procedural in nature, it added. 

“The refinancing of the short-term corporate debt alleviates one of the group’s main current exposures. The new facility better aligns the corporate debt profile with the cash flow profile of the Group’s main FPO business,” executive director and chief executive officer Leon Harland said.

He added that the group must now focus on maximising its revenue while continuing to manage its operational costs, as well as to find additional value via asset monetisation or other structural improvements.

“As part of this, the offshore marine services assets together with certain FPO vessels which are idle will be disposed of assuming commercially acceptable sale terms can be obtained. Surplus funds from operations and part of the proceeds from certain strategic initiatives including monetisation of assets and new project financing will be used to repay the loans,” he said."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/24/world-bank-keeps-malaysia-2019-gdp-outlook-at-4-7pc/,World Bank keeps Malaysia’s 2019 GDP outlook at 4.7% ,Economy,"Wednesday, 24 Apr 2019",1:48 PM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: The World Bank Group has maintained Malaysia’s 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast at 4.7 per cent, driven by private consumption.

Lead economist for Malaysia Richard Record said private consumption would continue to be the main driver of growth, albeit expanding at a more measured pace.

“Household spending will be buoyed by stable labour market conditions and income support measures such as the Cost of Living Aid (Bantuan Sara Hidup),” he told reporters at the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) Economic Update briefing here today.

He said gross fixed capital formation was expected to increase slightly, driven by the private sector, while public investment was expected to remain subdued in the near term.

“The external sector may be negatively affected by heightened uncertainty surrounding the global environment, particularly the possible escalation of US-China trade tensions,” he said.

Record said monetary poverty was expected to continue its downward trend in 2019, with a projected decline to 1.4 per cent based on the upper middle-income countries (UMIC) poverty line of US$5.50 (US$1=RM4.12) per person per day in 2011.

“Several initiatives for low-income households, including the national B40 Health Protection Fund, an insurance scheme for the B40 group, and affordable housing initiatives are in the pipeline to improve both monetary and non-monetary wellbeing,” he said.

Going into 2020, he said Malaysia’s economy was projected to expand at 4.6 per cent, and the country was expected to achieve high-income country status by 2024.

He said the country’s fiscal deficit was expected to narrow to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2019 and subsequently to three per cent in 2020.

“Near-term fiscal consolidation efforts are expected to be achieved primarily through rigorous expenditure rationalisation, with broad-based declines (in percentage of GDP) projected across major components of operating and economic development outlays.

In terms of risks and challenges, Record said the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the US-China trade tensions and shifts in global financial market sentiment would pose downside risks to Malaysia’s economy in the near term, due to the country’s high degree of trade and financial integration.

“On the domestic front, the relatively high levels of government liabilities and increased dependency on oil-related proceeds could potentially constrain the flexibility of fiscal adjustment against future macroeconomic shocks,” he said.

He said in the private sector, the relatively high level of household debt remained a source of macro-financial stability risk and would act as a constraint on household spending.

Record said the principal challenge to more rapid and inclusive economic growth lies in increasing labour productivity, which in turn depends on stronger human capital development.

“Malaysia’s score on the Human Capital Index (HCI) is 0.62, which is about as expected compared to other UMICs but well below that of its aspirational comparators,” he said.

He said Malaysia performed well on the child survival and years of schooling components of the HCI but did poorly relative to its economic peers in child nutrition and the quality of education.

“Key priorities are thus enhancing learning outcomes, reducing child under-nutrition and strengthening social protection systems to enable households to both invest in and protect human capital,” he said.

Meanwhile, acting chief economist for the EAP Region Andrew Mason said at the regional level, growth in developing EAP economies was expected to soften to six per cent this year and next year respectively from 6.3 per cent in 2018, largely reflecting global headwinds and a continued gradual policy-guided slowdown in China.

“While most of the EAP region managed to weather the deterioration of external conditions in 2018, the risk or conditions worsening would place additional pressure on policymakers despite most countries having reasonably sound economic fundamentals and robust domestic demand,” he said.

He said the World Bank had also reduced its forecast for global economy growth to 2.7 per cent this year from 2.9 per cent projected earlier in January this year on the back of challenging global conditions.

“Global growth is projected to slow to 2.7 per cent in 2019, reflecting decelerating activity in advanced economies and in many large emerging market and developing economies,” he said.

He said global trade had weakened further amid slowing global investment and manufacturing activity.

“While trade policy uncertainty has abated somewhat, global trade growth is expected to moderate further,” he added.

He said as growth prospects have softened, the tightening pace of international financing conditions had eased, providing some respite to countries with large external financing need needs. - Bernama"

The Statistics Department said on Wednesday the higher inflation recorded in Kuala Lumpur was due to a 4.2% increase in  food and non-alcoholic beverages index.

Penang state recorded a 0.6% increase while for Selangor and Putrajaya (0.3%) and Negeri Sembilan (0.3%).

These states' inflation rate surpassed the national consumer price index (CPI) rate of 0.2% in March from a year ago, it said.  However, the 0.2% increase was below a Bloomberg survey of a 0.3% rise.

Chief Statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the increase in the overall index was due to a 2% rise in the index of housing, water, electricity, gas & other Fuels (+2%), education (+1.3%), food & non-alcoholic beverages (+1.1%) and restaurant & hotels (+1%).

“On monthly basis, CPI increased by 0.2% as compared to February 2019. It was mainly supported by the index of transport (+2.6%), miscellaneous goods and services (+0.4%) and furnishing, household equipment & routine household maintenance (+0.3%),” he said.

In the first quarter, the CPI fell by 0.3% from the previous corresponding period due to the decline in the transport index, clothing and footwear and goods and services.

 
MIDF Research said looking ahead, Malaysia’s consumer inflation was likely to stay low following the lower capped prices of RON95 and diesel at RM2.08 and RM2.18 per litre respectively.

Nevertheless, demand-push factor remains firm amid stable job market and steady wage growth.

Commenting on the CPI data, it noted that food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation, which account for 29.5% of the CPI weights, increased by 1.1% on-year in March after maintaining at 1%on-year for two consecutive months. 

Among others, prices for fresh seafood and fruits contributed to the increase. Besides that, prices of food away from home rose firmly by 3.4% on-year during the month. 

“Going forward, we expect food component to be the key driver of overall inflation in 2019 driven by low-base effects on top of continued spill over effects from the Sales and Service Tax.

“In addition, being a net importer of food, Malaysia is also exposed to imported inflation due to ringgit depreciation hence initiating food inflation to stay at the high-side.

“Fuel-related items posted double digit deflation. The average price of Brent crude oil went up to US$66.70 per barrel in March from US$64.6 in the previous month. However, it contracted by -1% on-year,” it said. 

MIDF Research said oil price improved on trade talk hopes and Opec supply cuts. 

Domestically, retail fuel prices for RON95 recorded negative growth of -5.4% on-year while those of RON97 rebounded to a positive growth of 6.5% during the month. 

In tandem, prices of fuels and lubricants contracted by a single digit of -4.8% on-year in March 2019 compared to a double digit negative growth in February.

“Looking ahead, average Brent oil price for the first three weeks of April registered higher at US$71.3 amid removal of waivers for Iranian crude purchases,” it said."

This is supported by vegetable oil shortage in 2020 that will see increased demand for CPO.

Chief executive officer Chow Kok Choy said CPO competitor soybean would experience shortage due to planting in the next 12 months, affecting vegetable oil and increasing demand for CPO.

“The US-China trade war will hopefully be resolved by then and spur economic growth, leading to better oil consumption,” he told reporters after the company’s annual general meeting, here today.

In the near term, he said prices would go sideways due to the non-conclusive US-China trade war that would affect commodity prices.

Meanwhile, in the medium term, Chow said China, one of the largest consuming countries for CPO, would face African swine fever issues that would slow down soybean demand.

“China has a huge palm oil intake of 2.4 million tonnes. A discount on soybean to CPO, would narrow parity and CPO prices would not drop in the medium term,” he said.

Its president and CEO Yee Yang Chien told a press conference that the company is expecting a “big jump” in 2020 as five shuttle tankers are commissioned for a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) project, and begin contributing to its revenue.

“We are hoping for an at least 20% jump in our net operating cashflow in 2020, compared to 2018,” he said.

The reason the company is measuring its performance based on cashflow, he said, was due to the changes in accounting standard.

He noted that the group’s profits over the coming years will be very “lumpy” with a lot of large movements, largely due to these new accounting standards.

“If we build an asset, and it is chartered out to the client for 15 years, the current accounting convention requires us to recognise the value of the entire 15 years, in the year when the asset comes into service.

Arif Naqvi, the founder and ex-chief executive officer, was arrested Wednesday in the U.K. and is awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, a former managing partner, was apprehended Thursday in New York and remains in a federal lockup.

“The government moved forward because this defendant was present in the U.S. this week unexpectedly,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Griswold said in a hearing in Manhattan.

Abdel-Wadood pleaded not guilty and is due back in court on April 18. A graduate of American University in Cairo, with a master’s degree from Georgetown University in Washington, Abdel-Wadood was arrested at his hotel while in New York to shop for colleges for his son.

 His lawyer Benjamin Brafman declined to comment after court and wouldn’t say what schools the family was looking at. 

A lawyer for Naqvi in Dubai didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment on the charges.

Founded in 2002, Abraaj grew to become the Middle East’s biggest private equity fund and one of the world’s most influential emerging-market investors, with stakes in health care, clean energy, lending and real estate across Africa, Asia, Latin America and Turkey. But last year Naqvi surrendered control after it was revealed that the firm’s main revenues hadn’t covered operating costs for years.

Abraaj, which managed almost $14 billion, was forced into liquidation in June after a group of investors, including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, commissioned an audit to investigate the alleged mismanagement of money in its health-care fund.

Naqvi and Abdel-Wadood are charged with inflating the value of the Dubai-based firm’s holdings and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. 

Prosecutors say that from 2014 to 2018 they and others not identified in the court papers worked to artificially inflate the value of Abraaj’s emerging-market investments by more than $500 million.

The firm used money earmarked for investments to meet its own operating expenses without telling investors, prosecutors said.

Naqvi is also charged with stealing investors’ money for himself and his inner circle, including Abdel-Wadood, a resident of Dubai. The two are accused of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud.

In court on Thursday, Griswold said the evidence against Abdel-Wadood included secretly recorded calls and meetings, encrypted messages and millions of documents and computer files. 

Griswold said the U.S. had planted a geolocation tracker on Abdel-Wadood’s phone. Abdel-Wadood, dressed in a sports jacket, black shirt and jeans, didn’t speak during the proceeding.

Abdel-Wadood’s surprise apprehension was reminiscent of the 2016 arrest of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who was taken into U.S custody while on a family trip to Disney World in Florida. 

After being held in jail for more than a year, Zarrab agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testified against a Turkish banker who was convicted last year of helping Iran evade U.S. financial sanctions.

Naqvi was charged in United Arab Emirates in a $217 million bounced-check case, which was settled after the court sentenced him to three years in prison. Naqvi was out of the country at the time.

The case is U.S. v. Naqvi, 19-cr-00233, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). - Bloomberg"

But it also shows the ride-hailing startup can’t avoid pains of the staid business world: Insurance and payments.

Uber has been contending with rising costs for insurance and to accept debit and credit cards, which pay for the vast majority of bookings. 

In 2017, insurance costs jumped by $1.3 billion, while card-processing fees increased 62 percent to $749 million, according to Thursday’s IPO filing.

Recent filings from Uber and Lyft Inc. underscore how much money the rival ventures need for coverage tied to drivers. 

Both use captive insurance units based in Hawaii to help bear some of those risks. 

Uber said it’s socked away about $2.9 billion in reserves, compared with Lyft’s $810 million. 

It also warned that loss estimates can vary, exacerbated by the lack of historical data. For now, Uber’s management said it believes the amount is adequate.

One way Uber may combat rising payment-processing fees carries risks of its own. 

Last year, the company debuted Uber Cash, a reloadable digital wallet that lets customers store funds and use them on future rides. 

Such systems are popular among merchants looking to pare card fees, which otherwise pile up from each individual transaction.

On Thursday, Uber noted that trying to play a bigger role in payments may present other challenges.

“Our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties,” Uber said in the filing.

 “We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws.” - Bloomberg"

By the end of this year, Luckin aims to become the largest coffee network in China in terms of number of stores.Starbucks, which entered China 20 years ago, has dominated the market with more than a 50% share in 2017. The company has more than 3,700 outlets in the country and is also expanding at break-neck speed, opening a new store roughly every 15 hours. It’s aiming to have 6,000 sites in China by 2023.China may become an increasingly important market for coffee retailers due to the country’s low per-capita consumption of the beverage and rising middle-class affluence, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in January. Coffee consumption is estimated to grow by roughly 3% a year through 2023, according to Euromonitor.Luckin, with a focus on convenience and affordability, is seeking to lure urban office workers who don’t need the big plush spaces offered by Starbucks. Many customers are initially attracted to the coffee chain by its free vouchers, and the company plans to keep investing heavily in discounts and deals.Luckin’s outlets are cashless and designed for fast pick-up as well as delivery, with an app that rushes out deliveries in about 18 minutes. The company has a partnership with Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Starbucks only launched delivery in August, under a partnership with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Chasing the entrenched rival has been costly. Xiamen-based Luckin said it’s burning through US$130mil a year and may continue to see losses in the future. The company reported a net loss of US$241.3mil for 2018, on total revenue of US$125.3mil. Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, CICC, and Haitong International are the underwriters for the IPO. Luckin plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may including store expansions. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/24/china-aims-for-more-deals/,China aims for more deals,Business News,"Wednesday, 24 Apr 2019",,"WALLINI (Indonesia): In a rural part of Indonesia’s Java island, two orange-clad workers confer in Mandarin over plans to lay tracks on a stretch of a US$6bil high-speed rail project between the capital Jakarta and the textile hub of Bandung.Both are employees of the state-owned China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC), and have previously worked on a rail project in Uganda, another part of Beijing’s sweeping multi-billion dollar “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI) to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond.Delayed for nearly three years over land ownership issues, construction on the 142km Indonesian line finally kicked into high gear in 2018.When China hosts its second summit of nations that are part of BRI this week, Beijing is likely to showcase the Indonesian project along with its recent success in getting Malaysia’s East Coast Railway Link (ECRL) back on track after months of negotiations.Analysts say the two projects will be held up as China’s answers to criticism about high debt and the lack of transparency in the BRI and its attempt to refocus the programme on sustainable financing, green growth, and high quality.China’s foreign ministry said last week Beijing would “work together with all parties to benefit people across the world by jointly promoting the high-quality development of BRI in line with the national conditions of each country”.The BRI is a key policy of Chinese President Xi Jinping but has been controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through non-transparent projects.According to a draft communique seen by Reuters, participants at this week’s summit will agree to project financing that respects global debt goals and promotes green growth.“This bucks the trend of recent negative headlines around the BRI and challenges facing projects in several countries,” said Peter Mumford at the Eurasia Group consultancy.But in Malaysia, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad agreed to put the 668km ECRL back on track only after cutting the cost of the project from US$16bil to US$10.7bil.“The risk for China is that other countries, having seen Mahathir’s success, now try to adopt similar tough re-negotiating tactics on BRI projects, which could slow progress elsewhere,” said Mumford.To be sure, there is no sign of any of the BRI countries attempting to re-negotiate deals signed with Beijing. Analysts say China is likely to use its willingness to work with partner nations and make projects feasible to seek more business.Gold-platedBankers familiar with the deal say the Indonesian project is being constructed under “gold-plated terms”.Of the total US$6bil cost, China’s Development Bank will provide a US$4.5bil loan at 2% interest, according a project prospectus seen by Reuters. The remaining 25% of the project cost will be funded by equity provided by the consortium.The loan will have no sovereign guarantees, which are among the most controversial parts of Belt and Road projects, as they shift risk onto the governments of partner countries.Beijing lobbied hard against Tokyo in 2015 to win the Indonesian project as a way to showcase its high-speed rail expertise to international customers.“China wanted to deliberately show that its fast train was better than Japan ... we asked for the lowest rate possible and they gave 2%,” Rini Soemarno, Indonesia’s minister for state-owned enterprises, told reporters earlier this year.The railway’s financial terms came under debate during April’s presidential election between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and challenger Prabowo Subianto, who pledged to review the project if he pulled off a victory. While the results are still to be officially confirmed, sample vote counts by independent pollsters show Widodo to be headed for a second term.At the project site, there seem to be no doubts that it will be completed. Deep in Indonesia’s tea country, workers are directing drilling machines into a hillside, displacing red earth to carve out two tunnels that will lead to the station of Wallini, a tea plantation near Bandung.Chinese workers there told Reuters they had been at the site for a year and expected to stay until the project’s completion in 2021. Four new satellite towns will be built by the train consortium along the route.Widodo’s government is currently offering up to US$91bil in infrastructure projects to Chinese companies, according to Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs, who said Chinese officials have toured regional governments in search of projects to fund.Two top officials told Reuters Widodo intends to lead a delegation to the Belt and Road forum, where some of those projects are expected to be signed.One of the officials, Indonesia’s investment board chief, Thomas Lembong, told Reuters he expected this week’s summit to be a turning point, a “Belt and Road 2.0” with China more willing to negotiate.“The Chinese leadership will do whatever it takes to make Belt and Road a success, even if that means making it more professionalised, transparent, and more cooperative,” he said.The Singapore linkThe revival of the Malaysian project is likely to give China hope of securing another train project: the high speed rail (HSR) between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, which was postponed by Dr Mahathir after he initially threatened to cancel it.“China will likely take heart from the ECRL outcome and focus their efforts on ensuring that the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore HSR remains on track,” Harrison Cheng, an analyst at Control Risks, told Reuters.Beijing had been intent on being awarded the project to prove that its rail expertise could win over rivals in a first-world country like Singapore, with its diplomats describing it as a “must win at all costs project”.Apart from CREC, consortiums from Japan, South Korea, Europe, Singapore and Malaysia are also in the race, if the project is revived.A source in the Singaporean government said Malaysia would have to pay significant penalties to cancel the project altogether.  Dr Mahathir as well as Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will take part in this week’s Belt and Road summit, which could see China make a renewed push for the project. — Reuters"

However, we have yet to identify a suitable partner and location for the centre – we are still in talks with several parties,” Nadiah added.TMC registered a 30.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net profit to RM6.2mil for the second quarter ended Feb 28, 2019, bringing its net profit for the first half to RM13.28mil.The improved net profit during the quarter was mainly driven by optimisation of resources.TMC also achieved a healthy earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin of 22% in the first-half of financial year 2019 (FY19), on the back of increased patient load and a higher intensity of case mix.Outpatient attendance in the first-half of FY19 grew 3% y-o-y to 72,543, while inpatient admission increased 5% y-o-y to 10,946."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/24/reversing-slumping-investments/,Reversing slumping investments,Business News,"Wednesday, 24 Apr 2019",,"KUALA LUMPUR: Private investments in Malaysia have been slowing down since 2012 and the government should have a comprehensive plan to strategise a reversal of this trend.
The revival of large-scale infrastructure projects such as the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and Bandar Malaysia will help to spur private investment, moving forward, but the gestation period for these projects would take a few years.
According to Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC) executive director Lee Heng Guie, Malaysia’s private investment growth has slowed sharply from 21.4% in 2012 to only 4.5% in 2018.
This year, Lee expects the growth figure to moderate further to 4.3%. However, a more optimistic Bank Negara has forecast a higher private investment growth of 4.9% for 2019.
“Private investment momentum has moderated from 13.6% per annum in 2011-2014 to 6.1% per annum in 2015-2018. Not only that, the share of machinery and equipment to gross fixed capital formation declined progressively from 43% in 2010 to 37.3% in 2018,” he told reporters during SERC’s briefing on its quarterly economy tracker for the first quarter of 2019 (1Q19) yesterday.
Lee added that a comprehensive and investor-friendly investment policy is needed and the government should act as a facilitator in the domestic business scene.

“However, this does not mean that the private sector should just stand still. I hope the private sector will do its part and step up its investments to further prop up the economy,” he said, adding that the recent revival of several mega-infrastructure projects such as the ECRL and Bandar Malaysia would help to spur private investment, moving forward.
Lee urged the government to introduce a national investment strategy plan to re-energise the country’s private investments over the long run.
“Post 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Malaysia’s private investment-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio rebounded from an average of 11.2% in 2001-2010 to an average share of 16.1% in 2011-2018. The ratio has barely moved in recent years.”
The renewed interest in Malaysia as a regional strategic investment hub is likely to boost the country’s private investment growth, which has consistently lost its momentum post-2012.
A mixture of catalysts, which include the revival of the RM44bil China-funded ECRL, the multi-billion-ringgit Bandar Malaysia project and more investments from the United States could be the new growth drivers for the Malaysian economy.
This could further cement Malaysia’s position as a stable regional manufacturing hub.


Uptrend seen: Lee expects Malaysia’s economic growth to pick up from July.


While Chinese money coming into Malaysia has been anticipated as a result of the ECRL and Bandar Malaysia, what has not been expected is more American money coming into Malaysia, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
On Monday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said he had met American businessmen who had put in billions of dollars after the Pakatan Harapan government took over on May 9.
“In the nine months, they have invested billions in Malaysia. I think there are other investments coming in. Maybe processing the investment proposal is a bit slow. We are doing quite a lot – we have a lot of investments coming in. The confidence in the country has returned,” he told The Star.
In 2018, approved manufacturing investment from the US grew 184.9% or RM2.1bil from RM1.1bil in 2017 to RM3.2bil.
The US also remains Malaysia’s top trading nation in North America and its third-largest trading partner in the world at RM155.68bil or an 8.3% share of Malaysia’s total trade.
Exports to the US reached RM90.73bil, while imports were at RM64.94bil, both driven by manufactured goods.
In terms of implemented projects, the US is the second-largest investor in Malaysia in sectors such as electrical and electronics, medical devices, renewable energy and aerospace valued at RM74.01bil.
Meanwhile, the foreign direct investment (FDI) planned by manufacturers from China rose 410.8% or RM15.8bil from RM3.9bil in 2017 to RM19.7bil in 2018.
Besides manufacturers from China and the US, Malaysia’s Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has also indicated that Indonesian investors are widening their footprint here.
“Indonesian investors intended to invest RM9bil in 2018 from a mere RM0.5mil in 2017, which makes Indonesia the second-largest source of foreign manufacturing investment after China,” said Lim last month when unveiling Malaysia’s 2018 FDI numbers.
Speaking on the economic outlook for 2019, Lee expects Malaysia’s economic growth to pick up from July onwards, after a projected slower performance in the first-half period.
The think tank has revised its GDP projection for 2019 to a range of 4.5% to 4.7% from 4.7% earlier.
“Businesses are generally feeling more upbeat for the second half on a relatively more stable policy environment,” said Lee.
SERC anticipates private consumption to grow by 6.8% this year, while public consumption is expected to expand by 1.8% in 2019.
However, public investment is expected to contract 4.8% this year.
For 1Q19, Lee said the Malaysian economy is likely to expand by 4.4%. For context, the country’s GDP grew by 5.4% in 1Q18 and 4.7% in 4Q18.
“Exports in the first three months of the year would be a drag. Consumer spending will continue to support the economic growth, although it would not be as strong as in the fourth quarter of last year,” he said.Mohamad said he had met American businessmen who had put in billions of dollars after the Pakatan Harapan government took over on May 9.

Wall Street soared on upbeat results from Coca-Cola, Twitter, United Technologies and Lockheed Martin, which eased fears of a profit recession in a busy week for U.S. corporate earnings.

European shares rebounded from early weakness, pushing the STOXX 600 index to eight-month highs at the close. The energy-heavy FTSE 100 in London led regional gains, up 0.85 percent at a more than six-month high.

European oil and gas shares jumped 2%, with BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc leading gains in London, while the FTSEurofirst 300 Index <.FTEU3) of leading European shares hit eight-month highs.

The S&P and Nasdaq indexes breached their record closing highs during the session. The benchmark S&P 500 has surged about 17% this year, helped by a largely upbeat earnings season, hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution and a dovish Federal Reserve.

The government shutdown earlier this year weakened the U.S. economy and corporate growth but since March companies have done extraordinarily well and growth continues strong, said George Boyan, president of Leumi Investment Services in New York.

""We remain overweight (in equities) and any type of pullback we would view as an opportunity to add equity exposure,"" Boyan said. ""We've enjoyed quite a run but there's nothing to cause me to want to take off exposure at this point.""

Twitter surged 15.7%, its biggest single-day jump since October 2017, after posting better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a surprising rise in monthly active users.

Lockheed Martin posted better-than-expected quarterly profit as U.S. President Donald Trump's looser policies on foreign arms sales boosted demand for missiles and fighter jets. Shares rose 5.8%.

News that the United States told buyers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions lifted Brent, the global benchmark, and made for a lively return from a four-day Easter break for European markets.

Rising crude prices are a bullish sign of a stable economy and consumer, Boyan said. If prices rise much further it could speed the pace of inflation and cause the Fed to engage in more tightening, ""but I don't think we're there yet,"" he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 136.92 points, or 0.52%, to 26,647.97. The S&P 500 gained 26.34 points, or 0.91%, to 2,934.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.99 points, or 1.35%, to 8,123.25.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.55%.

The dollar climbed across the board as traders favored the greenback ahead of Friday's release of U.S. gross domestic product for the first three months of 2019.

The dollar was supported by data that showed sales of new U.S. single-family homes jumped to a near 1-1/2-year high in March.

The data followed recent upbeat news on retail sales and exports, which have eased concerns of a sharply slowing U.S. economy, analysts said.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six currencies, rose 0.38% after hitting its highest since June 2017. The euro fell 0.4% against the dollar, slipping below $1.12 for the first time in nearly three weeks.

Oil prices hit their highest since November.

Brent crude futures rose as high as $74.73, a level not seen since Nov. 1, before paring gains. Brent futures settled up 47 cents to $74.51 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 75 cents to settle at $66.30 a barrel.

Treasury yields fell, a counter-trend in the broader rise in yields over the past month. As the economic outlook has improved, yields have risen back from late-March lows.

U.S. first quarter GDP data on Friday could strengthen the case that while the current period of global expansion is in its late stages, the United States is on a firmer footing compared with other leading economies.

The dollar was steady at 111.885 yen after suffering mild losses overnight, weighed by a decline in long-term Treasury yields.

The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.7097 following a loss of 0.5 percent the previous day ahead of the closely-watched domestic inflation report.

Operating profit jumped 6% from better supply chain management and effective marketing while effective tax rate grew close to the normal rate at 24.8% following a lapse of tax incentives.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, 1Q19 sales grew 8% and operating profit soared 69% due to the Chinese New Year festivities.

China's social security system is under increasing strain as a result of a rapidly ageing population and a shrinking workforce.

The China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a government think tank, said in a report this month that the country's pension funds could become insolvent by 2035, with a rapidly dwindling workforce unable to support the growing number of elderly people.

But Nie Mingjuan, head of the pension and insurance office at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, told a news conference on Tuesday that China was now preparing ""positive, comprehensive and scientific measures"" to handle the challenge.

""The central government is paying close attention.. and is fully able to guarantee over the long term that pension funds will be paid on time and in full,"" Nie said.

China's dwindling workforce is expected to become one of the country's biggest challenges in the next few decades, and the issue was a major preoccupation at the latest national session of parliament in March.

The country is also taking action to try to encourage couples to have more children, relaxing a strictly enforced ""one-child policy"" in place for 40 years. Birth rates fell for the second consecutive year in 2018.

Nie noted that changing demographics were a ""major concern"" and had already put the system under great strain, with those over 60 years of age now accounting for 17.9 percent of the total population.

""Overall, the result was below expectations,"" said the research house.

In its earnings announcement yesterday, CCB said 1Q19 revenue fell 25% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM293.2mil due to 27% lower vehicle sales although this was mitigated by 19% higher service revenue.

According to Affin Hwang, the group also recorded a larger negative Ebitda of RM4.6mil in the quarter from negative RM2.3mil in 1Q18 as it was dragged by a shift to a lower margin mix from E-Class to the C, GLC and A-Class models, as well as higher interest expenses and operating costs.

""We think the launch of the all-new Benz A-Class sedan will likely reinvigorate sales volume in the coming months, but the lower priced product mix could further erode margins for CCB.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/24/glut-forces-lng-producers-including-petronas-to-offer-flexible-deals/,Glut forces LNG producers including Petronas to offer flexible deals,Oil & Gas,"Wednesday, 24 Apr 2019",9:00 AM MYT,"SINGAPORE: The world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers including Shell, Total and Petronas are increasingly selling from global supply pools instead of dedicated projects as buyers leverage a fuel surplus to force ever more flexible deals.

This marks an accelerated turning from traditional long-term contracts that lock customers into taking regular volumes from specific projects under oil-linked pricing formulas.

Global oversupply that has pulled spot LNG prices <LNG-AS> down by more than 50 percent over the past half-year has producers succumbing to consumer demands for fuel on shorter notice and without sourcing or destination restrictions.

""A more dynamic and liquid LNG market, and the need for greater flexibility by traditional LNG buyers, is providing opportunities for shipping optimisation and trading, and enabling new entrants such as LNG traders,"" said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research for Australia at Credit Suisse.

EXPANDING PORTFOLIOS

Royal Dutch Shell, holder of the world's biggest LNG supply portfolio, signed deals last year with Hong Kong's CLP Power, South Korea's SK E&S and Panama's Sinolam LNG for deliveries that could come from any of its global projects, according to an annual report published this month by the Paris-based International Group of LNG Importers (GIIGNL).

The Anglo-Dutch major is also adding new Australian project Prelude and its LNG Canada plant to its supply pool, which already includes fuel from Australia, Egypt, Peru and Russia.

Shell's LNG sales volumes hit 71.21 million tonnes in 2018, up 8 percent from the previous year, driven by increased LNG purchases from third parties and higher LNG output, the company said in its 2018 annual report.

""It's important that the industry can supply LNG to customers on the basis that they want to buy,"" said Steve Hill, Shell's executive vice president for gas and energy marketing and trading, at a conference in Singapore in March.

France's Total, with the second-largest LNG portfolio, will more than double its overall supply to about 40 million tonnes a year by 2020 from 2017, and out of that volume about 65 percent will have flexible destination or be reloadable, according to a company presentation on its website.

This comes with the start-up of new projects in Russia and Australia and as Total increases offtake volumes from third-party United States export sites.

Malaysia's Petronas - which handles production for the world's third-biggest LNG-supplying nation - also signed several short-term deals last year from its portfolio including its first ever term deal with India.

""Portfolio selling enables higher margins through trading and optimisation, facilitates marketing to take new project final investment decisions, and allows sellers to provide greater supply flexibility to customers,"" Kavonic said.

Spot and short-term trades made up 32 percent of overall LNG volumes in 2018, up from 27 percent in 2017 and less than 20 percent in 2010, GIIGNL said in early April.

NEW BUYERS, NEW RISKS

LNG supply is expected to grow this year by a record 40 million tonnes, which could further increase spot volumes.

With new buyers entering the market, their needs are evolving quickly, said Nicholas Browne, gas and LNG director at consultancy Wood Mackenzie in Singapore.

""New markets usually want LNG quickly because of the rapid growth of floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), which has accelerated their market entry,"" Browne said.

""Portfolio players are well suited to meet this need,"" he said.

Bangladesh and Pakistan are two of the relatively new buyers, both expanding import capacities and looking for new supplies.

Besides Petronas, another long-time LNG supplier that is going the portfolio route is Woodside Petroleum. The Australian producer signed a heads of agreement with China's ENN Group in April on such a deal, as it markets gas from its proposed Scarborough project.

Also, Russia's Novatek is selling 50 percent of its volumes from its Arctic LNG 2 project on a spot basis, which it says is driven partly by the emergence of portfolio players.

Developers are also increasingly taking final investment decisions on new projects without having firm sales agreements already in place.

Shell decided to go ahead with its $30 billion LNG Canada project last October with few buyers, while Exxon Mobil Corp and Qatar Petroleum committed to their Golden Pass LNG project in the United States without binding buyers to the total volume.

But this potentially exposes projects to new pricing risks, and some portfolio players could be trying to mitigate these risks by increased trading in spot markets and by buying or selling cargoes using alternative pricing formulas.

""The shift from long-term take-or-pay contracts to portfolio supply is placing greater risks on project sponsors and exacerbating the risks of oversupply,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note in April. - Reuters"

This follows the signing of an agreement today to supply, test, repair and/or carry out overhaul activities on aircraft safety equipment for both airlines for a three-year period with an option to extend for another two years.

FGV and Lembaga Tabung Haji are working with an adviser to gauge potential buyer interest in Trurich Resources Sdn, which controls 42,000 hectares (103,800 acres) of oil palm estates in Kalimantan, according to the people. 
They may seek to value Trurich at as much as US$1bil including debt, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has been seeking to clean up the balance sheets of state-backed companies after a global scandal erupted over the previous government’s stewardship of the 1MDB investment fund. 
Since coming to power in a surprise election win last year, he has pledged to improve transparency at Malaysia’s government-linked firms and apply more scrutiny to their business dealings as part of an anti-corruption drive.

The deal would help Trurich’s owners offload assets that have been the subject of contention. Trurich said in December it filed a police report alleging that former senior management of the pilgrims fund misled the company into overpaying for Indonesia land purchases between 2008 and 2009.
The executives haven’t publicly responded to the allegations.
 FGV and the pilgrims fund haven’t made a final decision on whether to sell, and they may decide to keep the assets if they can’t fetch an attractive price, the people said. 
Representatives for FGV and Tabung Haji declined to comment, while Trurich didn’t answer calls to its office seeking comment.

The Malaysian finance ministry agreed in December to take over as much as RM19.9bil of underperforming assets from Lembaga Tabung Haji, which helps Muslims save for a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
The rescue will help revive the fund’s balance sheet by offloading equity investments with significant unrealized losses.

FGV swung to a net loss of RM208.8mil in the fourth quarter of last year, from a net income of RM50.4mil a year earlier. 
The company has been focused on implementing new controls to bring its plantations’ performance in line with other large players in industry, Group chief executive officer Datuk Haris Fadzilah Hassan said in February.

A number of plantations are coming up for sale amid forecasts that crude palm oil prices will recover later this year. 
Sime Darby Plantation Bhd. has been considering the sale of a stake in its Papua New Guinea unit, Bloomberg News reported last year, and is reviewing its Liberia operations. 
PT Triputra Agro Persada’s owners, including GIC Pte, are exploring a sale of the Indonesian palm oil producer, people familiar with the matter said in December."

The decline of advertising gradually turned the newspaper industry ""from monopoly to franchise to competitive,” the billionaire chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. 
And now most newspapers are ""toast.”

""The world has changed hugely,” Buffett said in the interview with Yahoo Finance, which will serve as the livestream host for the event in May.

The bleak outlook echoes Buffett’s remarks at last year’s annual meeting, when he lamented the state of the newspaper industry. Berkshire’s BH Media, which owns papers across the country, has been cutting jobs to cope with declining advertising revenue.

Berkshire struck a deal last year for Lee Enterprises Inc, which owns papers including the St Louis Post-Dispatch, to manage its newspapers and digital operations in 30 markets.

Buffett, 88, said last year that it wasn’t of much economic consequence to Berkshire because the company bought its papers at ""reasonable” prices.

Craigslist’s Impact

Readers sought out newspapers when they were packed with ads about bargains, jobs and apartments, Buffett said. But Craigslist and other sites have taken over that role.

By 2016, the newspaper industry’s ad revenue was nearly a third of what it was a decade before, falling to US$18bil from US$49bil, according to Pew Research Center.

""It upsets the people in the newsroom to talk that way, but the ads were the most important editorial content from the standpoint of the reader,” Buffett said.

Not all papers are doomed, though. The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal will survive, he said."

It doesn’t hurt that some of his own relatives have rallied to the cause.Kwek’s wife and son, Cecilia and Kingston, spent S$9.8mil (US$7.2mil) on an apartment in Boulevard 88, according to a City Developments Ltd exchange filing late Monday. His nephew and City Developments’ group chief strategy officer Kwek Eik Sheng snapped up another unit on one of the upscale project’s lower floors for a more modest S$4.3 million.Kwek senior, as chairman of City Developments, abstained from the board’s review and approval of the proposed sales, leaving it to the developer’s audit and risk committee to review the terms and conditions and greenlight the transactions.Lucky for his relatives, they also got a discount. Kingston and Cecilia got 22% off, comprising the 20% early-bird discount offered to all members of the public plus 2% because Kingston, as a director, is eligible for the preferential price cut offered to directors and their immediate family members. Nephew Eik Sheng got a 23% markdown, the 3% because he’s also a company employee.To be fair, sales at Boulevard 88, located just off Singapore’s prime Orchard Road shopping district, have been pretty strong regardless. According to data released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority earlier this month, 26 of the 35 apartments that were marketed in March were sold, including one penthouse that went for S$28mil, or S$4,927 per sq ft. This is the highest price per sq ft for a new unit since June 2013, property broker OrangeTee & Tie Pte said.Private-home sales soared in March as developers marketed more projects after a typically slower February that included the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. Developers sold 1,054 units last month, more than double the 455 in February — Bloomberg."

At the moment it is still at its infantry stage contributing about RM20mil to our topline,” she told reporters after Pharmaniaga’s AGM yesterday.Farshila expects  the group to post a better financial performance  this year on the back of its Indonesian operations, new product launches as well as improvement in its collection.Last year, Pharmaniaga incurred higher financing costs, which had impacted its profitability due to slower collection from government hospitals in Malaysia and Indonesia.Farshila was quick to point out that the issue of collection had been resolved.“Moving forward, we are working to pare down our gearing level and 2019 will be a better year for the company,” she said.For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, Pharmaniaga’s net profit dropped 80% to RM4.44mil from RM21.7mil a year earlier  due to lower revenue coupled with higher finance costs. Revenue for the quarter fell to RM596.64mil compared to RM613.16mil.For its Indonesia operations, Farshila said Pharmaniaga is targeting to introduce 20 products and to open up more branches this year.At the moment, Indonesia contributes about 20% to 28% to its revenue.Meanwhile, on Pharmaniaga’s concession to supply medicine to the government, which will expire this November, Farshila said the company was confident of getting the extension.On the recent news about Pharmaniaga having a monopolistic position in the public sector’s pharmaceutical sector, Fashila said there were other vendors supplying to the Health Ministry.She said about 33% of MoH’s pharmaceutical budget is from the concession with Pharmaniaga. “It is incorrect to describe Pharmaniaga as a monopoly as there are other vendors supplying to the government,” she said."

The group is adding new solutions such as cavity array package to support RF filter for wireless device applications,” said CGS-CIMB.Market research group Yole Developpement SA projected the average dollar content in a 5G smartphone to reach US$32, as compared with US$7.20 for an average 4G smartphone.In FY18, the RF segment contributed close to 40% of CSZ’s sales. However, the research house expected CSZ to deliver lower sales in FY19 due to a sluggish outlook for the global smartphone market.CSZ is an important revenue and earnings driver for MPI, given that it contributed 31% of MPI’s revenue and 32% of MPI’s net profit in FY18. “We cut MPI’s FY19 to FY21 earnings per share (EPS) by 1% to 5% to reflect softening industry demand across all applications. We expect the group’s sales to drop by 7% to 9% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in Q3FY19, but this is still better than the 14% q-o-q decline projected by leading semiconductor players and customers. “We are optimistic of stronger demand in Q4FY19, driven by inventory replenishment and improving US-China trade relations. We forecast a robust 13% FY18 to FY21 EPS compound annual growth rate for MPI, driven by growing automotive and industrial demand,” said CGS-CIMB.Going forward, MPI aimed to double its revenue from US$377mil in FY18 to over US$750mil in three to five years, driven by new customer and design wins in the automotive and industrial (A&I) and communication segments. Its long-term strategy to reduce its dependence on communications and expansion of A&I portfolio remained on track, given that the A&I segment’s contribution to group sales in FY18 increased to 53% from 43% in FY15."

This is the first step, since we need fresh capital injection so a white knight is important. We have spoken to the other creditors and they are willing to support us,” he said.“So we have two good backers: of the white knight and the larger creditors. The restructuring scheme has now been finalised, and we are looking at doing this within the next month or so. Once we are ready we will announce the scheme structure and we hope to resolve this matter in two to three months,” Abdul Rahim added.He said that the company needs the support of at least 75% of its creditors to support the restructuring scheme and that it was “fairly confident” they can get their support.The company and its subsidiaries reported total liabilities amounting to RM335.6mil in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018.Barakah will also soon be placing out some of its equity to raise funds.“We need to have fresh capital and part of it we are looking at doing a (share) placement.“The white knight will take up a big chunk of the shares but we are also open to other parties to take up (the stake) as well,” Abdul Rahim said.Commenting on the current selling by the major shareholder Nik Hamdan Daud, Abdul Rahim said the selling action is a forced selling action that is being done by Kenanga Investment Bank.Commenting on the future outlook for the company, Abdul Rahim said that for its current projects, the company is already positive in terms of gross profit and is cashflow positive at the project level. “While we are still reporting losses up to Q4 in Dec 2018, it is due to the legacy losses for previous projects. “But moving forward once we have resolved this in the restructuring scheme: we can have a fresh start.“ Once we complete this restructuring scheme which we hope to do by end of this year, we should show not just cashflow positive not just at the project level but also at the bottomline level,” he said.Meanwhile, Barakah said charter rates for the oil & gas industry have not risen in tandem with the rise in oil prices and this could be a troubling trend as most oil majors are still very cautious.The rates have remained stuck in the lows similar to when oil was trading at its depth in the 2015-2016 period when oil price plunged.“The contract opportunities has increased with the rise in oil price today but then the rates to provide services is still very low. “When there was a correction in oil prices, there was a major correction in service prices including vessel charter rates and also the services rates,” Abdul Rahim said at a press briefing yesterday.“Despite oil prices having already recovered to US$70 per barrel, the rates we are seeing today remains at the 2015/2016 level when oil prices were at US$30 – US$40 per barrel. The reason for that is that there are not enough number of jobs. When everybody is hungry, people are throwing prices and the prices for services remain at a very low level,” Abdul Rahim added.Barakah announced yesterday it entered into a memorandum of understanding with Singapore Exchange Catalist Board listed Vallianz Holdings Ltd to form a strategic alliance for both parties to explore business opportunities in Malaysia and the Middle East."

In a joint statement issued yesterday, they said the orderly conditions were underpinned by ample domestic liquidity, robust market infrastructure and firm macro-economic fundamentals.
“In particular, the Malaysian bond market continues to be vibrant with a deep secondary market having an average daily trading volume of RM5.4bil year-to-date compared to the past three-year average of RM3.6bil,” they said. This was a 50% increase on-year.
They said liquidity in the forex market recorded a sustainable average daily trading volume of US$12bil, of which the forex swap and forward market accounted for close to half of the average volume.
“The increase in dynamic hedging activities by global institutional investors has improved market access and further contributed to the liquidity in the forex forward market,” they said.
Bank Negara and the SC said they would continue to engage with key market participants and intermediaries to further develop the depth and breadth of the Malaysian financial markets in ensuring accessibility while preserving stability and transparency
They issued the statement following the 16th Bank Negara-SC bilateral meeting in Kuala Lumpur to advance discussions on areas of mutual interest between both authorities, including sustainability initiatives, digital asset regulations and resilience of the financial markets.
At the meeting, they discussed initiatives relating to the sustainability agenda, particularly on the SC’s Sustainable and Responsible Investment Framework (SRI) and Bank Negara’s Value-Based Intermediation Strategy.
Both regulators agreed to embark on a joint research study to develop a clear taxonomy on sustainable economic activities, starting with fund-raising and lending practices.
They also looked into the transmission of climate and environmental-related risks to the financial system and economy, and the feedback loop.
“This initiative is an expansion of ongoing collaboration between the authorities in the areas of national strategic interest, especially in Islamic finance,” they pointed out.
As for digital asset regulations, both authorities would work together to facilitate industry innovation, fund-raising activities for early-stage companies and the trading of digital assets.
“The arrangement will also support the oversight of digital asset activities and ensure that systemic risk and financial integrity measures remain effective,” the regulators said."

“Under the earlier agreement, the first two LMS will be built in China, while the remaining two will be built in Malaysia. But, for cost-saving purposes, all four vessels will be built and delivered in China,” said BHIC executive deputy chairman and managing director Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor.
“This will not have any material impact on the group,” he added. Ahmad Ramli was speaking to reporters after the firm’s AGM yesterday.Last month, the Defence Ministry revised the contract price to build four LMS for the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) lower to RM1.05bil from RM1.17bil originally negotiated for in 2017.
As part of the revision, BHIC’s associate company – Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd – will no longer build two of the vessels in the country.
Despite the lower contract pricing, Ahmad Ramli said the government vessels are more than 40 years old and there would be more maintenance and ship-building contracts in the pipeline.
“There are more LMS contracts that we can bid for and build in the future,” he said.
Notably, the LMS is part of the RMN’s “15-to-5 transformation plan” that calls for 18 such ships to replace the ageing warships.
On the outlook, Ahmad Ramli expects 2019 to be a challenging year for BHIC and the firm is exploring opportunities in the region.
“We have an order book of RM4.3bil, which would last until 2023, and we can’t just depend on government contracts, moving forward,” he said.
About 60% of its order book is shipbuilding contracts, mostly from remaining work on an earlier RM9bil contract to build six littoral combat ships (LCS) and LMS projects.
The remaining 40%, meanwhile, is for maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs for submarines, helicopters and ships.
“We will soon welcome our new chairman, Datuk Seri Amrin Awaluddin, and we are excited about the group’s next chapter of growth,” Ahmad Ramli said.
For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), BHIC slipped into the red, posting RM108.3mil in losses compared to a RM10.6mil net profit a year earlier, due to impairment and provisions.
Revenue for the period declined to RM169.11mil from RM277.65mil in FY17.
“While earnings last year were impacted by impairment and provisions, BHIC kicked off 2019 on a positive note with contracts from RMN for MRO jobs worth RM150mil.
“We also received a letter of intent for the integrated logistics support contract for the LCS project, which we hope to finalise in the next few months,” Ahmad Ramli said."

Vallianz is 57.67%-owned by Saudi’s Rawabi Holding Company Ltd and is listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange. The company owns and operates a young fleet of 76 offshore support vessels and covers markets in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America.

The development follows the resignation of Barakah’s chief executive office officer Nik Hamdan Daud last week to pave way for the restructuring of the loss-making company.  

In a press release issued on Tuesday, Barakah said that by joining forces, both parties are able to leverage on each other’s strengths to expand their scope of services, technical capabilities and geographical reach along the oil and gas (O&G) value chain.

Under the MOU, will offer its engineering and operational capabilities to support Vallianz’s existing and future projects.

‘This includes technical consultation, feasibility studies, front-end engineering design and project engineering services, among others. The project scope also covers future co-tender arrangements for offshore projects which are deemed suitable by both parties,” the company said. 

Barakah’s acting group chief executive officer Abdul Rahim Awang said the alliance is a springboard for the company to penetrate beyond Malaysia.

“Vallianz’s strong foothold in the Middle East opens up new opportunities for us to expand our reach into new markets while utilising our competencies and assets. The alliance also provides us access to various other assets that will 

enable us to bid more competitively,” Abdul Rahim said. 

Looking ahead, he said the company will continue to pursue similar strategic alliances in addition to tendering for more jobs. 

“We are in the midst of formulating a debt restructuring scheme to manage the group’s debt. The successful completion of the debt restructuring exercise will put us on a firmer financial footing while relieving our cash flow in the short to medium term,” he added.

Beijing is taking a range of steps to exert more control over the program, officials and participants said, including a more muted publicity drive, clearer rules for state-owned-enterprises, restricting use of the BRI brand, and building overseas auditing and anti-corruption mechanisms.

 It’s also stepping up efforts to get developed nations to join in to spread the risk of building projects in poorer nations and to counter allegations that BRI is just an attempt to build China’s political influence.

China’s Foreign Ministry referred questions for comment to the National Development and Reform Commission. The State Council Information Office and NDRC didn’t reply to faxes seeking for comment about the Belt and Road Initiative.

”The Chinese government had a great sense of frustration as the latest criticisms not only come from developed but also developing countries,” said Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Nanjing University, “The international pressure is working to compel China to move forward.”

Toned-down Rhetoric

As global leaders gather in Beijing this week for Xi’s second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, China is having to defend its image in the light of the trade war with the U.S. and growing concern about Beijing’s political and economic influence in Asia and Europe. 

Authorities have purged terms in state media and official statements that have driven anxiety of China as a menacing power, from its “Made in China 2025” campaign to the decade-old “Thousand Talents” program to encourage talented Chinese workers living overseas to come back home.

”Since the trade war erupted, China faced domestic and international resistance and encountered setbacks in several countries which made the party rethink the publicity, especially on an international image,” said Suisheng Zhao, director of the Center for China-U.S. Cooperation at the University of Denver’s Josef Korbel School of International Studies. 

“But I don’t think changes in the tone will make a difference. China’s international image has changed fundamentally from a moderate China to an assertive China.”

The evolution of BRI also reflects a need to ensure more robust standards expected by developed nations as China works to extend the initiative into Europe. 

Italy’s announcement this year that it will participate in BRI -- the first Group of 7 country to sign up -- was a big win for China. But negotiations with other major European Union nations face major hurdles over regulations and standards, said a person familiar with the discussions. 

Stumbling blocks include the request that financing meet the standards of the International Monetary Fund and EU, the person said, without providing more detail.

“Extending cooperation with developed countries means it has to keep up with Western standards,” said Zhu Feng. “China is increasingly emphasizing third-party cooperation so as to increase compliance and transparency.”

Third-party market cooperation -- signing up a developed nation to help build infrastructure in one of the Belt and Road countries -- is the focus of the next phase of BRI, according to a government official involved in China’s overseas development. 

This is a way to depoliticize the BRI and China will sign documents with Britain, Switzerland and Austria on this kind of cooperation during the forum, following similar agreements with France, Spain, and Australia, said the person. 

That official, like other government bureaucrats, did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Ethical Investing
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said last week he will take part in the forum in Beijing but won’t sign a formal accord to cooperate like Italy. 

The Swiss government said it will sign an agreement to help Swiss banks and insurers finance projects in some Central Asian countries, while U.K. Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Britain would only sign a pact with China that met its “ethical parameters.”

Some observers say the changes China is proposing may not go deep enough to fix major issues of concern. 

To really clean up the program, China should terminate projects that have generated significant problems, forgive debt to countries that are in a precarious financial position due to Chinese lending, and reduce China’s ownership of projects to below 50 percent by bringing in high-quality international partners, said Daniel Kliman, senior fellow in the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.


That’s unlikely to happen because it would undermine the Belt and Road’s ability to advance Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions, he said. “China recognizes the growing backlash, and is now trying to rebrand the Belt and Road,” said Kliman, who thinks that any changes China did announce would be just cosmetic.

Anti-corruption Push

One area that China has targeted is corruption. Xi’s six-year-old domestic anti-graft campaign has rebuilt the political atmosphere at home, with over one million officials punished. Now officials are trying to find a mechanism to grapple with corruption linked to BRI projects overseas.

That’s not going to be easy. Most BRI projects are in junk-rated countries, often with poor reputations for financial transparency. A report from the Washington-based Center for a New American Security said that “in countries that already have a high level of kleptocracy, Belt and Road projects have involved payoffs to politicians and bureaucrats.”

New Rules

Xi initiated a “Clean Belt and Road” drive in 2017 during the first BRI Forum and called for stronger international cooperation against corruption. That campaign is being led by Li Shulei, deputy party chief of the party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said a person familiar with the matter.

Li, 55, is a former academic who entered Peking University when he was only 14, and first worked under Xi back in 2008 when he was the head of the Central Party School. The CCDI has teamed up with World Bank to train representatives from state-owned-enterprises.

A big part of the effort to clean up the BRI are new rules being formulated for overseas investment and operations of SOEs, which are by far the biggest investors in BRI projects. 

Central SOEs have undertaken 3,116 BRI investment and infrastructure projects, according to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. SASAC and the CCDI separately issued two guidelines in 2017 and 2018 which required state enterprises to increase supervision of overseas units and personnel.

“China is trying to rethink a little bit of this,” said former World Bank President Robert Zoellick, referring to the governance of BRI projects. 

“Chinese technocrats are very capable people and they know that some of these debt problems will explode at some point, so it’s better to be transparent about the debt going forward.” he told Bloomberg News on the sidelines of an event in Washington on April 11.

China has stepped up auditing of overseas projects and investments by SOEs, according to an official familiar with the matter. Regulators now require companies to do better due-diligence early on to prevent them from jumping into projects without proper evaluation of risks that might “leave loose ends and bury landmines,” the person said.

Belt and Road projects overseas have exposed a lot of issues in the past few years and SOEs have been identifying and summarizing the shortfalls, a person who drafted the internal compliance rules for a major central SOE told Bloomberg. The focus in the future will be placed on overseas compliance.

One of the critics of the BRI projects in his country was Malaysian Prime Minister tUN dR Mahathir Mohamad, 93, who demanded a renegotiation of the China-backed East Coast Rail Link. 

That had been approved by the previous government and Mahathir eventually reduced its scope and cut costs by a third. In a speech on April 16, his Deputy Minister for International Trade and Industry, Ong Kian Ming, spoke of the “backlash and global scrutiny” caused by some BRI projects, and the accusations of “inflated prices” that created a financial burden on governments.

”There’s been an unrecognized freeze on SOE investment,” according to the American Enterprise Institute’s Derek Scissors, and part of that is due to the BRI’s political problems. 

“This is an undeclared rectification campaign, to last at least through the April summit. The corruption in BRI countries hasn’t changed, only now China finds it embarrassing,” according to Scissors, who’s an economist at the Washington-based policy research group. He recorded no large SOE investments in February. - Bloomberg"

A tweet posted on the travel booking website First Choice captured the trepidation among holidaymakers, while some airlines and travel agents said they would waive cancellation charges for people scheduled to travel imminently.

“What are you doing about the holidays you have booked to that country?” tourist Judith Ann Clayton asked on the social media site.

“Clearly it is unsafe for anyone to go there.” Others set to travel said they would not to be cowed into cancelling.

“Not giving in to terror. We want to support you in your time of need. Never gave any thought about cancelling our trip,” Facebook user John Karmouche said in a post.

Named by the Lonely Planet guide for independent travellers as the best country to visit in 2019, Sri Lanka had rebuilt its image as a tropical paradise after crushing a long-running separatist insurgency by ethnic minority Tamils a decade ago.

Arrivals of 2.3 million last year were up by more than 400 percent on 2009 levels, according Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority data.

But the suicide bombers who killed at least 290 people, including 32 foreigners, and wounded 500 have in all likelihood ended the boom in tourism for some time.

Denmark’s richest man, Anders Holch Povlsen, and his wife lost three of their four children in a blast at one of the hotels. A British mother and son were killed at a breakfast buffet and two Australians were also among the dead.
At Colombo airport, departing holidaymakers were relieved to be getting out.
“There have been a lot of messages from home,” said British teacher James Turner, who was leading a school cricket tour.

Tourists were also arriving but many said they would steer clear of the capital.

“We’re getting straight out of Colombo,” said Briton Ruth Adams, on holiday with her two children.

WARNINGS

Tourism was Sri Lanka’s third largest and fastest growing source of foreign currency, after private remittances and textile and garment exports, accounting for almost $4.4 billion or 4.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.

“The attacks will not only impact already weak economic activity (real GDP growth was at a 17-year low of 3.2 percent in 2018), but also the country’s relatively vulnerable external liquidity position,” Citi Asia Economics said in a note that warned the hardest blow would fall on tourism.

A U.S. State Department travel advisory warned of the danger of ”terrorist groups” plotting more attacks. Targets could include tourist locations, transport hubs, shopping malls, hotels, places of worship and airports.
Other governments, including Japan and Australia, have also cautioned citizens planning travel to Sri Lanka.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Australians ”reconsider your need to travel and avoid all affected areas”.

JTB, Japan’s largest travel agency, has waived cancellation charges, and modified its package tours leaving Japan before May 10 to avoid risky locations, like Colombo, and will decide later on tours leaving after May 11, a spokeswoman said.

Two major airlines in neighbouring India, state-owned Air India and the largest carrier Indigo, owned by Interglobe Aviation, said they would waive rescheduling and cancellation charges for travel scheduled before April 24.

India was the single largest source of visitors last year, with 425,000, while 266,000 came from China, Sri Lanka’s newfound friend, and more than 254,000 from old colonial power Britain.

The peak season for tourism in Sri Lanka is between December and March, while the rainy monsoon season lies between May and September.

MakeMyTrip.com, one of India’s largest travel booking portals, said in a statement that it was too early to quantify the impact of the attacks on tourist traffic to Sri Lanka, but anticipated that some would defer travel or go elsewhere.

There were no immediate cancellations on yatra.com, another Indian online booking portal, but new inquiries and bookings had slowed, said chief operating officer Sharat Dhall.

Visitors come for the glorious vistas across the forests in the national parks, the surf crashing on sandy beaches, verdant tea plantations, Buddhist temples and charming colonial towns.

The government’s latest tourism campaign celebrates the island’s charms with the simple slogan ‘So Sri Lanka’.

The resumption is a sign that the Chinese refiner sees fewer risks from importing U.S. oil as trade talks between the two world’s largest economies have progressed. Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec suspended imports in September in case Beijing imposed punitive tariffs on U.S. oil imports as part of the U.S.-China trade war.

The supertanker Maran Artemis, carrying about 2 million barrels of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland crude, is waiting off eastern China’s Qingdao port to discharge its oil, according to Refinitiv analyst Emma Li.

Noble, a second Very Large Crude Carrier also carrying 2 million barrels of WTI Midland crude, is scheduled to arrive in Zhanjiang in southern China in early May, Refinitiv data showed.

Unipec has purchased more cargoes to arrive in May and June as the company gradually resumes U.S. oil imports, the sources said.

Sinopec could not be immediately reached for comment.

“The suspension was a precautionary measure,” one of the sources said.

The company could have imported U.S. oil in recent months, but it decided not to take the risk of having cargoes at sea that could be caught out by the introduction of a Chinese tariff, he added.

Some of China’s smaller, independent refiners have previously tested the system by importing smaller cargoes in November and March which successfully cleared customs without invoking tariffs, trade sources said.

China imported 245,600 barrels per day of U.S. oil in 2018, equivalent to about 3-1/2 supertankers per month, data from China customs showed, equivalent to about 2.7 percent of China’s total imports. - Reuters"

The bank’s base case is that the U.S. and China will agree to end their protracted trade fight by end-June, paving the way for tariffs to be lifted, analysts including Ed Morse said in a report. A deal between the two economies is now “on course” for the end of the second quarter, the bank said.

Raw materials have advanced in 2019 aided by gains in energy and metals, with the latest leg up this week driven by the U.S. decision not to extend sanctions waivers for buyers of Iranian crude. At the same time, the U.S. and China have stepped up the pace of diplomacy to try to resolve their trade squabble, with speculation that an agreement may come next month. A resolution would benefit demand for commodities from soybeans to pork.

“Partly as agreed during the trade talks, China is expected to boost purchases of energy and agricultural products from the U.S. in the months and years ahead,” the bank said. The current period will be “be another strong quarter for commodities,” and raw materials are also “looking up” into the third quarter and potentially to year-end, it said.

Global growth is seen at 2.8 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2020, according to the bank, which described that outlook as “still reasonable.” It added: “While a constructive global economic outlook is good for commodities, China being a key engine for global growth would be a further positive.”

Iron Ore

In addition to the supportive macro and trade backdrop, Citigroup was positive on commodities that have been hit by supply crunches, especially iron ore. The steelmaking raw material has surged this year following mine suspensions in Brazil and disruptions to Australian output from a cyclone.

The bank also warned that the spread of African swine fever in China may end up contaminating as much as a quarter of the country’s vast herd, or up to 200 million pigs. That would tighten global protein supplies and the U.S. lean hog market as the mainland stepped up imports of pork, beef and poultry, it said. - Bloomberg"

The CSI 300 Index of equities traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen sank 2.3 percent on Monday, its biggest loss in a month. Property developers led the plunge, along with old economy shares such as banks and industrial companies. The gauge fell as much as 0.5 percent on Tuesday.

After the CSI 300 surged almost 40 percent this year, investors have grown increasingly sensitive to whether the authorities will maintain the massive scale of stimulus seen in the first quarter. 

A statement late Friday from a meeting of the Politburo was interpreted by traders as meaning the economy is on a stable enough footing that extended support isn’t needed. Instead there was a focus on deleveraging and avoiding speculation in the housing market.

”People have come to a clear consensus that there won’t be any aggressive stimulus that floods the economy with excessive liquidity, indicating limited room for valuation recovery,” said Dai Ming, a Shanghai-based fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co. “The market is entering a consolidation period that may last one to two months.”

The CSI 300 was little changed at the midday break. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.5 percent as the city’s equity market traded for the first time since Thursday.

China’s stock market has historically been driven by liquidity and momentum traders and any sense that these may dry up could act as a serious overhang.

Equities slumped earlier this month amid concern the authorities would act to slow the increase in leverage in the market. The CSI 300 sank 4 percent on March 8 after investors took a rare sell rating from the nation’s largest brokerage as a sign that the government was unhappy about the speed of the rally.

The central bank last week gave a signal that supply of cash would be less liberal, when it rolled over only half of the funds coming due through one of its longer-term policy tools, instead offering more seven-day money.

”The Politburo meeting showed that investors had gotten ahead of themselves,” said Wang Zhihong, managing director at Whiterock Asset Management Co. The phrasing of the statement, and the implication that real estate may be targeted, has weakened sentiment, he said.

A gauge of property developers in Shanghai tumbled 3.8 percent on Monday, its worst performance since March 8, with Gemdale Corp. and China Vanke Co. losing more than 6 percent. Sany Heavy Industry Co., which makes excavators and steam rollers, plunged the most in more than three years before gaining 0.6 percent on Tuesday.

To be sure, analysts don’t expect China to shift to a significantly tighter stance, especially with rising pork prices boosting inflation.

 With the bond market weakening, stocks may still be a preferred alternative. The yield on 10-year government rose to 3.42 percent on Tuesday, poised for its highest close in five months.

”There is a bit of an overreaction” in equities, said Gerry Alfonso, director of international business department at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. “Keeping leverage at reasonable levels will be good for the real economy and in the long term for the stock market.”

But with officials now showing concern about the risk of asset bubbles again, the days of making easy money on the stock market may be nearing an end. 

China’s equity market has added $2.5 trillion in market value since its low in October, and over 50 companies on the CSI 300 have risen more than 50 percent this year, meaning there’s a lot of profit for some investors to pocket.

”The market lacks strong momentum to rise further,” said Zhang Gang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co. “Investors are now expecting a shift from unconventional stimulus policies we saw last year to more targeted measures to support the economy.” - Bloomberg"

S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday it had assigned its preliminary 'BB-' long-term issuer credit rating to Serba Dinamik. 

It also assigned its preliminary 'BB-' issue rating to the proposed sukuk trust certificates that the company guarantees.

“The rating reflected the company's modest scale with commoditised service offerings, limited record of large-scale project execution outside of oil and gas, large investment needs for future business growth, and somewhat untested asset acquisition strategy,” it said. 

S&P said however, the company's record of timely project execution within budget, respectable client base, good cost control, short but prudent history of equity raising, and investments temper these constraints. 

Serba Dinamik's revenues were from the Middle East and Malaysia. Its main business segments are operations and maintenance (O&M), and engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) targeted at the oil and gas and the power sectors.

“Serba Dinamik's order book of about RM8.3bil as of Dec 31, 2018, which typically lasts three years, provides good cash flow visibility,” it said. 

Over the past three years, Serba Dinamik had shown strong revenue and cash flow growth – indicating the company's capability to renew expiring contracts and win new ones at a healthy rate. 

“We expect Serba Dinamik to extend its record of project wins and renewals, supporting its top line and cash flow. The company's long-term association with and repeat business from some key clients in O&G segment, such as Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc., provides it with good experience to expand its target client base.,” it said.

Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings accorded a long-term issuer default rating (IDR) of 'BB-' with a stable outlook to Serba Dinamik.

“Serba Dinamik's  rating reflects its strong market position in Malaysia, where it is the fourth-largest provider of operation and maintenance (O&M) services to the oil and gas industry by 2017 revenue. 

“The rating is also supported by Serba Dinamik's solid financial profile, short-to-medium term revenue visibility and relatively low earnings cyclicality. Nevertheless, we believe that the company's small operating scale constrains its rating,” it said.

Fitch said its rating was based on a bid book annual growth rate of 10% in 2019 and beyond; new order-book win rate of 30% across 2019-2021 and order-book renewal rate of 25% from 2019.

It also expected Serba Dinamik to deliver an earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin pf arpund 17% over 2019-2021."

Not only that, he won’t inherit his father’s stake in Centaline Group, estimated to be worth about us$400 million according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, because it was donated to charity more than a decade ago.

But Alex Shih isn’t perturbed, even though he’s missing out on the wealth that the offspring of some Hong Kong tycoons are taking control of along with the family business. 

Li Ka-shing,the city’s richest man, last year handed the reins to son Victor, while billionaire Lee Shau Kee last month said he was considering retiring from Henderson Land Development Co. and putting his two sons in charge.

“I personally accept it,’’ the 30-year-old Shih said of his father’s decision not to pass on the family fortune to his three children. 

“He told us when we were very young and we didn’t have a choice. He would say that it’s better not to lead a life that’s too comfortable in one go. You’ll treasure more if you
gain things step by step.”

Shih took over running Centaline, which handles two out of every five property transactions in Hong Kong, at the start of this year when he was named vice-chairman. He is set to become chairman when his 70-year-old father Wing-Ching Shih retires,which he expects to happen sometime soon.

He ascended to the top job after a difficult year for Centaline, which was founded in 1978. Commission revenue rose a bare 1 percent to about HK$19 billion ($2.4 billion) last year, and net income slumped 52 percent to HK$501 million, as a downturn in Hong Kong’s property market and growing competition in mainland China took its toll.

Hong Kong’s property market has since rebounded, and Shih is looking to modernize the agency. He oversaw the introduction of virtual-reality house viewing in 2017, and more recently a blockchain platform to streamline sales and rental agreements.

“The company is like a big ship,” Shih said. “I am trying to provide new technology tools to make it move faster.”

While the firm handles millions of dollars of transactions a day, the softly-spoken Shih says he earns only a regular salary. 

The foundation that his father donated the Centaline stake to aims to alleviate poverty in rural China, from building infrastructure to supporting under-privileged children’s education.

“My friends who are working in finance are making more money than I do,” he said.

A graduate of the London School of Economics and Political Science, Shih said he considers himself an average Hong Kong citizen. His office is small and sparsely decorated, and he enjoys hiking and playing badminton -- hardly the pursuits of the billionaire set.

His modest upbringing has also helped keep him humble -- his father eschewed the elite international schools favored by Hong Kong’s wealthy and enrolled his children in local government-subsidized schools, and instilled his philosophy that money should be used to help the less fortunate from an early age.

He even worked as a real estate agent when he first joined the family business. “It was quite tough -- staying outdoors to compete with other agents for limited customers, rain or shine.”

And, like many other millennials in a city ranked the world’s least-affordable for the past nine years, he’s still saving for his first house.

Shih’s advice to his peers? Be realistic.

He aims to buy a two-bedroom apartment in a middle-class neighborhood in West Kowloon -- or the slightly more upmarket Ho Man Tin area if his parents chip in, citing those areas good public transport links and potential for price growth as draw cards -- a far cry from the multi-million dollar mansions his agency sells.

“Despite oil prices having already recovered to US$70 per barrel, the rates we are seeing today remains at the 2015/2016 level when oil prices were at US$30 - US$40 per barrel.

The Saudis are closely monitoring oil-market developments after the U.S. announcement regarding export sanctions on Iran, Al-Falih said in a statement. 

“In the next few weeks, the Kingdom will be consulting closely with other producing countries and key oil consuming nations to ensure a well-balanced and stable oil market, for the benefits of producers and consumers as well as the stability of the world economy.”

Any nation continuing to buy Iranian oil will face U.S. sanctions, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Monday after announcing that temporary waivers granted to some nations late last year won’t be renewed when they expire next month. The current set of waivers -- issued to China, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey -- are to expire on May 2.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will ensure an “appropriate supply” of oil along with the U.S., Pompeo told reporters in Washington. “Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil,” President Donald Trump said on Twitter.

The Saudis and the U.A.E. can increase their combined production by about 1.5 million barrels a day within a short period, according to people with knowledge of the situation, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 

Iran shipped about 1.1 million barrels a day of crude and condensate in the first two weeks of April, tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

'Fill the Gap’
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers such as Russia “could easily come in and fill the gap caused by any reduction in Iran exports,” Ashley Petersen, senior oil market analyst at Houston-based Stratas Advisors LLC, said in an interview with Bloomberg television.

The elimination of waivers will probably remove about 700,000 to 800,000 barrels a day from the oil market in the near term, according to RBC Capital Markets. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimate that it could cause Iran’s production to decline by 900,000 barrels from current levels.

Saudi Arabia will assess the impact of the U.S. decision on the oil market before raising output, according to one of the people. The biggest producer in OPEC can pump an additional 1 million barrels a day within a short period, the person said. Saudi Arabia produced 9.82 million barrels a day in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The U.A.E. can increase output to 3.5 million barrels a day from a current level of 3.045 million, one of the people said.

OPEC and allied suppliers including Russia agreed to limit their production until the end of June to buttress crude prices and avert a glut. They are due to meet next month to assess the market and again in June to decide whether to extend the cuts.

Russia’s Economy Ministry sees its crude and condensate output increasing slightly in 2019 to 558 million tons, or 11.21 million barrels a day, according to its five-year outlook. Russia produced 556 million tons in 2018. - Bloomberg"

The price of CPO averaged at around RM2,020 a tonne in the first quarter, United Plantations said.
The lower price was due to the larger than expected Malaysian palm oil production, combined with slow export growth.
""The burdensome stocks are likely to keep palm oil prices under pressure in the near to medium term in order to garner additional demand from the domestic and the export market,"" it said.

Tit-for-tat tariffs from the China-United States trade war have been costly for many. Adding to the strain on Chinese manufacturers have been European Union duties on Chinese products ranging from electric bikes to solar panels.
March brought some encouraging news for manufacturers. Industrial output rose at its fastest rate since mid-2014 and exports rebounded more than expected, while first-quarter growth was better than expected.
Still, some manufacturers who depend on U.S. sales are struggling. At the Canton Fair in southern China this past week, they put on a brave face, but feared they will need to take more measures to survive if Beijing and Washington fail to seal a trade deal.
Botou Golden Integrity Roll Forming Machine Co lost some US customers when tariffs pushed up prices for its machines making light steel girders and bars for building frames, according to Hope Ha, a saleswoman.
It now offers an 8% discount as a sweetener.
“We have to give discounts because they pay high tariffs,” said Ha.
Ball bearing maker Cixi Fushi Machinery Co gave long-term customers a 3%-5% discount, according to representative Jane Wang.
But that was not enough, so the company suspended a product line generating US$30,000 monthly revenue, she said.
“We will wait for the agreement and then we will see again,” she said. Now, the focus is on its main market, the Middle East.
Some have been able to pass along increased costs.
California-based ACOPower has increased prices about 10-15% on some of its made-in-China, solar-powered refrigerators, said founder Jeffrey Tang. “We have no choice,” he said. “We must increase the price.”
Tang says his portable fridges cannot be made affordably in other countries. But if there’s no trade agreement, and tariffs rise, the equation could change.
“Maybe I’ll just ship all the components to Vietnam to do the assembly.”
Aufine Tyre rented and filled a warehouse last year in California in anticipation of anti-dumping duties, which were later imposed. In another move to circumvent tariffs, it will soon open a plant in Thailand to make tires.
Jane Liu, a sales manager, said Aufine plans to send 50 containers a month from Thailand, with 220-240 tires in each, and later expand.
Some companies at the fair cheered Beijing’s move to trim China’s value-added tax to 13% from 16% at the start of April, and its pledge of tax rebates for exports.
“Things like this give us some protection or else we would suffer losses,” said Wills Yuan, a salesman at Ningbo Yourlite Import & Export Co in Shenzhen, which produces LED lights.
Shenzhen Smarteye Digital Electronics Co, a maker of surveillance cameras, which are not on the US tariff list, was able to drop prices because of the tax break, according to sales manager Simple Yu.
“We save a lot on costs, so we can sell at a low price,” he said. — Reuters"

Investors were waiting for some of the biggest S&P 500 companies, including Boeing Co, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc to report first-quarter results later in the week. Additional reports could ease investor fears of an earnings recession.

Trading volume - which was the lowest so far in 2019 - was also muted by the fact that some investors were still on vacation after Friday's U.S. market holiday and because markets were closed in parts of Europe and Asia on Monday.

Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York said he has been encouraged by quarterly results even though it was early in the reporting season.

""To some degree it could be some concern because we know it's a big earnings week. What will the overall tenor of this week look like by Friday?"" said Orlando.

Orlando was impressed with the latest GDPNow forecast from the Atlanta Federal Reserve for a first-quarter expansion of 2.8% compared with a 0.2% forecast a month ago.

""That tells you the data has turned around and maybe earnings aren't going to be so bad,"" he said.

S&P 500 profits are expected to drop 1.7% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data, in what would be the first earnings contraction since 2016.

But more than three-quarters of 82 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have surpassed beaten-down expectations.

With the S&P trading at less than 1% below its record high reached in September, investors were also waiting for upcoming data such as first-quarter GDP before making bigger bets.

""It's important at this point to sit back and reflect on what the prospects are that will take us forward. It's appropriate to see what we're seeing today,"" Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 48.49 points, or 0.18%, to 26,511.05, the S&P 500 gained 2.94 points, or 0.10%, to 2,907.97 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.21 points, or 0.22%, to 8,015.27.

The S&P energy index jumped 2.1% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since January, as oil prices surged on the United States' move to further clampdown on Iranian oil exports, tightening global supplies.

But seven of the 11 major S&P sectors ended the day lower, led by a 1% drop in the real estate index.

Intuitive Surgical Inc fell 7% and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after the surgical robotics maker's quarterly profit missed analysts' estimates.

Kimberly-Clark Corp gained 5.4%, touching a near two-year high, after the consumer products maker reported better-than-expected earnings.

The PHLX Housing index fell 0.97% after data showed U.S. home sales fell more than expected in March, pointing to continued weakness in the housing market.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 70 new lows.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/23/us-to-end-all-waivers-on-imports-of-iranian-oil-crude-price-jumps/,"US to end all waivers on imports of Iranian oil, crude price jumps",Oil & Gas,"Tuesday, 23 Apr 2019",8:29 AM MYT,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehran's oil revenues which sent crude prices to six-month highs on fears of a potential supply crunch.

The Trump administration on Monday said it will not renew exemptions granted last year to buyers of Iranian oil, a more stringent than expected decision that caught several key importers who have been pleading with Washington to continue buying Iranian oil sanctions-free.

The United States reimposed sanctions in November on exports of Iranian oil after U.S. President Donald Trump last spring unilaterally pulled out of a 2015 accord between Iran and six world powers to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Eight economies, including China and India, were granted waivers for six months, and several had expected those exemptions to be renewed.

Tehran remained defiant, saying it was prepared for the end of waivers, while the Revolutionary Guards repeated a threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipment channel in the Gulf, Iranian media reported.

The White House said it was working with top oil exporters Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to ensure the market was ""adequately supplied."" Traders, already fretting about tight supplies, raised skepticism about whether this more stringent approach, along with ongoing sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry, could backfire in the form of a major spike in prices.

""It is a surprise that the requirement to cease importing Iranian oil should come at this next May deadline,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, director of the energy, economics and security program at Washington-based Center for a New American Security. ""Having only several weeks’ notice before the deadline means there are lots of cargoes booked for May delivery. This means that it will now be harder to get it out by the deadline.""

Iran's oil exports have dropped to about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from more than 2.5 million bpd prior to the re-imposition of sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a briefing Monday, said ""we're going to zero across the board,"" saying the United States had no plans for a grace period for compliance beyond May 1.

The White House intends to deprive Iran of its lifeline of $50 billion in annual oil revenues, Pompeo said, as it pressures Tehran to curtail its nuclear program, ballistic missile tests and support for conflicts in Syria and Yemen.

A senior administration official said President Donald Trump was confident Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will fulfill their pledges to compensate for the shortfall in the oil market. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Frank Fannon said Riyadh was taking ""active steps"" to ensure global oil markets were well supplied.

Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, in a statement on Monday, did not commit to raising production, saying it was ""monitoring the oil market developments"" after the U.S. statement, and that it would coordinate with other oil producers to ensure a balanced market. OPEC is next scheduled to meet in June.

While Saudi Arabia is expected to boost output again, analysts fear the U.S. move - along with sanctions on Venezuela - will leave the world with inadequate spare capacity.

The international Brent crude oil benchmark rose to more than $74 a barrel on Monday, the highest since November, due to the uncertainty surrounding increased supply from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations, while U.S. prices hit a peak of $65.92 a barrel, the highest since October 2018.

“Despite high and fast-rising oil prices and high geopolitical disruption risk, (Trump) is betting the farm that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will contain upward price pressure by more than offsetting Iranian oil,"" said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy.

In addition to China and India, the economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Italy and Greece had also been granted waivers.

QUESTIONS ABOUT WORLD SUPPLY

Trump has been clear to his national security team in recent weeks he wants the waivers to end and national security adviser John Bolton has been working on that within the administration.

""One thing that has clearly been going on inside the administration is a debate about when they should get to zero,"" said Rosenberg.

In recent months, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have cut supply dramatically. OPEC, along with ally Russia and others, agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million bpd, but they have exceeded those benchmarks, with Saudi Arabia alone reducing supply by 800,000 bpd.

While Italy, Greece and Taiwan already have halted purchases, doing so could prove much more challenging for China and India. Turkey, another buyer, already has slammed the U.S. decision. ""We had indicated privately that zero was coming and now we're here,"" a senior administration official said on Monday, referencing Turkey's concerns.

Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Monday that it opposed unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran and that China's bilateral cooperation with Iran was in accordance with the law.

South Korea’s Yonhap news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the South Korean government had been negotiating with the United States at all levels to extend the waivers and that it would continue to make every effort to reflect Seoul's position until the May deadline.

In India, refiners have started a search for alternative supplies but the government declined to comment officially.

A spokesman for the Japanese embassy in Washington said Tokyo was not planning to comment on the decision but Japanese officials say the Iran issue was discussed at a meeting between the Japanese foreign minister and Pompeo last Friday.

It is also expected to come up during a visit to Washington this Friday by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which is expected to focus on North Korea and the challenge posed by China’s rise. - Reuters"

The telco had attributed the slight dip in performance to seasonally weaker mobile service revenue and Ebitda, which was partially offset by lower taxation and cost efficiencies.

RHB added that there was a RM24mil delata on core earnings due to the implementation of MFRS 16 as higher Ebitda was more than offset by an increase in depreciation and financing cost.

Digi's postpaid segment saw mobile service revenue falling 3% y-o-y on seasonality and higher handset amortisation.

In the prepaid segment, revenue fell 13.7% y-o-y from lower interconnect rates and a change in iits distribution/channel strategy.

It added that this might spur Saudi Arabia into producing more oil in a reversal of its supply cuts.

""But Saudi is not expected to rush into a reversal of the cuts as they are expected to first examine the effect of the sanction waiver cancelation before it decides how to respond to it. They are unlikely to be alone in this,"" said Ambank.

He said the ringgit's performance should be evaluated on an annual basis, as it was normal for the value of currencies to fluctuate from day to day.

“The ringgit's fluctuations are normal. We will have to see its performance over a year. It won't be very accurate if we do a daily projection. Let's look at the performance at the end of the year,” he said in an interview with Bernama on Monday.

He said this when asked whether the government would adopt an intervention policy to curb the ringgit's fall following the recent weakening of the local currency.

 Last week, global index provider FTSE Russell said it would review Malaysia's market accessibility level in its World Government Bond Index (WGBI) due to concerns about market liquidity.  

This led to the ringgit's weakening, as investors were worried about the prospects of the government debt being removed from the index. 

 Malaysia, currently assigned a ""2"" (highest level of accessibility) and included in the WGBI since 2004, is being considered for a potential downgrade to ""1”, making it ineligible for inclusion in the index.  

Maybank Kim Eng said the ringgit had underperformed against the US dollar in April by two per cent in reaction to news that FTSE Russell might drop Malaysia from the WGBI by September. 

 The news came a week after Norway's Ministry of Finance proposed to omit emerging government and corporate bonds, including Malaysia's, from its fixed income benchmark for the Government Pension Fund Global.  

Maybank Kim Eng expects the pace of the recent up-move in the US dollar against the ringgit to moderate and possibly retrace below 4.12, as the FTSE review is still ongoing, and with the external environment of green shoots and support for Brent crude price, palm oil price may mitigate the temporary negativity surrounding the ringgit.  - Bernama"

The findings from CPA Australia's 10th annual Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey follow extensive surveying of over 3,600 small business operators in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.

CPA Australia Malaysia Country Head Priya Terumalay says the survey results show that there has been a positive shift in sentiment among Malaysia's small businesses that reflects the sector's continued focus on drivers of growth.

""Malaysia's small business sector has had a strong 12 months, with 65.5 per cent of respondents reporting that they grew over this period.

""Looking to 2019, the results are even more positive, with three quarters of small businesses expecting to grow this year,"" she said.

The positive shift in sentiment is also reflected in small business confidence in Malaysia's economy, with nearly 70 per cent (69.1 per cent) expecting Malaysia's economy to grow, much higher than expectations for 2018, when 53.7 per cent expected the economy to grow.

In a period of global economic uncertainty, this upturn in small business confidence in Malaysia is a vote of confidence in the nation's economic direction.

""It is not surprising to us that we are seeing an improvement in small business confidence in Malaysia. Throughout the 10 years this survey has run, Malaysia's small businesses have shown they typically have a focus on factors that are linked to long-term growth, including innovation, e-commerce and  technology. 

""They also show they have a strong focus on positive influences of growth such as improved customer satisfaction, attracting and retaining good staff and improved business strategy,"" said Priya.  

""Small businesses from Malaysia continue to be relatively strong users of digital technologies, particularly in comparison to their competitors from Australia, Singapore and New Zealand. Over 40 per cent of Malaysian businesses surveyed (43.4 per cent) earned more than 10 per cent of their income from online sales. 

An overwhelming majority use social media for business purposes, with 45.1 per cent stating that they use it to sell their products or services.  

""There is a relatively strong focus on innovation among Malaysia's small businesses, with 29.3 per cent stating that they will innovate in 2019, beating the survey average of 20.8 per cent. The Malaysian government has done much to encourage a culture of innovation and entrepreneurialism, with policy developments.

""The positive outlook of Malaysia's small business sector is translating into jobs, with more than a quarter (25.7 per cent) stating that they added staff in 2018 and are likely to be even stronger creators of jobs in 2019, with 45.1 per cent expecting to add staff.

""Global trade war concerns are impacting Malaysian small businesses, with over a third (33.6 per cent) expecting that this issue should have a negative impact on their business in 2019, close to the survey average of 34.7 per cent. 

However, for some of Malaysia's small businesses, a trade conflict could create opportunities, with 22 per cent stating that they expect a trade war to have a positive impact on their business.

""We expect that the positive business conditions experienced by Malaysia's small businesses in 2018 will continue into 2019, with small businesses remaining focused on innovation, e-commerce and technology,"" Priya said.

In a joint statement issued on Tuesday, Bank Negara Malaysia and the Securities Commission (SC) said liquidity in the foreign exchange (forex) market recorded a sustainable average daily trading volume of US$12bil.

“The forex swap and forward market accounts for close to half of the average volume. The increase in dynamic hedging activities by global institutional investors has improved market access and further contributed to the liquidity in the forex forward market,” they said.

Bank Negara and the SC said the authorities will continue to engage with key market participants and intermediaries to further develop the depth and breadth of the Malaysian financial markets in ensuring accessibility while preserving stability and transparency.

The statement was issued after their 16th bilateral meeting to advance discussions on areas of mutual interest between both authorities, including sustainability initiatives, digital asset regulations and resilience of the financial markets. 

The authorities also said the Malaysian financial markets have remained resilient. 

“Conditions in the capital, forex and money markets continued to be orderly, supported by ample domestic liquidity, robust market infrastructures and firm macroeconomic fundamentals,” they added.

During the meeting, the authorities discussed initiatives relating to the sustainability agenda, particularly on the SC’s Sustainable and Responsible Investment Framework (SRI) and Bank Negara's Value-Based Intermediation Strategy (VBI). 

Both regulators agreed to embark on a joint research study to develop a clear taxonomy on sustainable economic activities starting with fundraising and lending practices. 

Another area being looked at involves understanding the transmission of climate and environmental-related risks to the financial system and economy, and the feedback loop. 

“This initiative is an expansion of ongoing collaboration between the authorities in areas of national strategic interest especially in Islamic finance,” it said.
 
As for digital asset regulations, both authorities have entered into coordinating arrangements which would facilitate industry innovation, fundraising activities for early-stage companies and trading of digital assets. 

“The arrangement will also support the oversight of digital asset activities and ensure that systemic risk and financial integrity measures remain effective,” they said."

It doesn’t hurt that some of his own relatives have rallied to the cause.

Kwek’s son and daughter-in-law, Kingston and Cecilia Kwek, spent S$9.8 million ($7.2 million) on an apartment in Boulevard 88, according to a City Developments Ltd. exchange filing late Monday. 

His nephew and City Developments’ group chief strategy officer Kwek Eik Sheng snapped up another unit on one of the upscale project’s lower floors for a more modest S$4.3 million.

Kwek senior, as chairman of City Developments, abstained from the board’s review and approval of the proposed sales, leaving it to the developer’s audit and risk committee to review the terms and conditions and greenlight the transactions.

Lucky for his relatives, they also got a discount. Kingston and Cecilia got 22 percent off, comprising the 20 percent early-bird discount offered to all members of the public plus another 2 percent because Kingston, as a director, is eligible for the preferential price cut offered to directors and their immediate family members. 

Nephew Eik Sheng got a 23 percent markdown, the 3 percent because he’s also a company employee.

To be fair, sales at Boulevard 88, located just off Singapore’s prime Orchard Road shopping district, have been pretty strong regardless.

Assets that are being taken over include shareholdings of Singapore-based CWT Pte, with investment properties in the U.S. and golf courses in China, according to a statement.

 Lenders had threatened to take control of the assets unless CWT made payments by 9 a.m. on April 17 tied to a HK$1.4 billion ($179 million) loan taken out in September.

Operations of CWT Pte are continuing as usual and trading in CWT International shares will remain suspended, according to the statement. HNA Group’s $200 million bond due 2021 was indicated at a record low of 77 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, according to traders. 

That setback for HNA suggests that the Chinese conglomerate is still struggling to cope with its debt after embarking on more than $25 billion of asset sales since 2018, unwinding one of the biggest global acquisition binges in the nation’s history. 

CWT Pte said last week it had redeemed in full its S$100 million ($74 million) 3.9 percent notes due April 18.

Government Crackdown

Chinese companies including HNA, Anbang Insurance Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group Co. have been unloading assets in recent years after attracting government scrutiny because of the financial risks associated with their debt-fueled expansions. 

HNA’s asset sales alone have exceeded $20 billion since 2018, while the founder of Anbang -- a firm temporarily seized by the government last year -- is now serving jail time.

Besides the crackdown on the big conglomerates, China’s capital controls are limiting individuals’ spending on global real estate as the government tries to guard against any large and destabilizing exodus of cash from the economy.

Parties tied to HNA recently sold a site with two historical homes in Hong Kong’s prestigious Peak area at a loss for HK$550 million ($70 million), the Hong Kong Economic Times reported earlier this month, citing unidentified people.

US Sales

HNA has also been shedding assets in the U.S. In January, the conglomerate sold 850 Third Ave., a midtown Manhattan office building near Trump Tower, in a $422 million transaction that resulted in a loss for HNA. 

Separately, it has been searching for a buyer for its stake in neighboring 245 Park Ave., a skyscraper it bought in 2017 for a near-record $2.21 billion. SL Green Realty Corp. said late last year that it would take over operations of that property.

Last year, HNA agreed to sell office towers in Minneapolis and San Francisco and the global hotel chain Radisson. It also disposed of its stakes in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and two Hilton spinoffs.

Bloomberg reported in November that HNA was marketing more than $40 billion of domestic and international holdings, including more than 90 assets in China, the U.S. and U.K. 

Among the priciest assets on the list were 245 Park Ave., Hainan’s Pearl Island, valued at 21.1 billion yuan ($3 billion), and Shanghai’s HNA Plaza, valued at 4.92 billion yuan.- Bloomberg"

Crude oil prices rallied by about 3% yesterday to their highest since late 2018 as the United States looked set to announce that all imports of Iranian oil must end or be subject to sanctions.

Growth in the city’s gross domestic product is set to accelerate to 2.1% in 2019 and 3.8% the following year before slowing to 2.8% in 2021, according to projections released on Sunday by the emirate’s department of economic development. GDP expanded only 1.9% in 2018, substantially below forecasts made by the International Monetary Fund.
A turnaround for the economy is riding on a better performance for industries other than Dubai’s bellwether real estate sector, with improvements seen this year and next for finance, tourism as well as retail and wholesale. 
The emirate’s 2020 World Expo will contribute 22.7 billion dirhams (US$6.2bil) to the economy during the fair next year and another 62.2 billion dirhams after it’s over, according to auditing firm Ernst & Young LLP.
“Economic momentum has picked up at the beginning of this year with a surge in new business licenses and improved optimism on jobs and business performance,” the department said in its statement.
Growth in financial services is expected to speed up to 2.4% in 2019 from last year’s 0.6%.
Real estate, which has struggled with declines in prices, is one of the few sectors not projected to accelerate further after the expo. The industry’s expansion will slow this year to 3.7% from 7% in 2018.
The emirate’s economic slowdown to 1.9% for last year was revealed by Dubai’s statistics centre in March, in a long-awaited set of figures after months of no official word on the economy.

The poll’s gauge – calculated by subtracting the percentage of fund managers who responded they’re underweight in Japan from those who said they’re overweight – stood at minus 4 percentage points, down from 3 percentage points in March.
Global investors don’t intend to be overweight in  Japan over the next 12 months as they remain cautious about Japan’s profit outlook, according to the survey, which was conducted from April 5 to 11 with 239 investors participating.
Still, Yamada isn’t entirely pessimistic. Given the lack of investors holding Japanese equities, a lot of buying could kick in with the right trigger, he said. 
A bounce in US long-term yields, for example, will be interpreted as a sign the global economic outlook has brightened. This could boost appetite for Japanese financial stocks and cyclical sectors including steel and autos, he said.
There may also be help from China. The nation’s economy unexpectedly held up in the first three months of the year as policy makers boosted stimulus. Gross domestic product exceeded economist estimates, while factory output jumped more than expected. The politburo said the economy was better than expected in the first quarter, but tried to temper expectations for a quick rebound.
“It’s not as if the China numbers are starting to get extremely good but it’s better than what people had thought,” Yamada said. “There’s room for buying positions to be filled” in Japanese equities.
Adding to signs that Japanese stocks can sustain their rally, foreigners have turned net buyers, purchasing 744 billion yen of shares during the first two weeks of this month. That’s after offloading a net 2.5 trillion yen in equities during the first three months of the year. Both the Topix and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced last week to their highest since December.
But Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc, is skeptical that this month’s rebound can last. — Bloomberg"

The newswire noted that at that price, the exercise could raise about US$250mil (RM1.03bil), which would make Leong Hup’s IPO the largest since Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd’s listing in July 2017.
Leong Hup would be launching its prospectus this Thursday.
Agricultural goods processor and merchant Louis Dreyfus Company and billionaire Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan are reportedly cornerstone investors for the IPO, according to Bloomberg.
This is in addition to the Employees Provident Fund, the AIA Group, Maybank Asset Management, RHB Asset Management, as well as prominent investor Chua Ma Yu.
Leong Hup is also mulling to set aside an estimated 40% of its base offering for cornerstone investors.
The group is majority-owned by the founding Lau family and is backed by private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners.
Leong Hup, which is involved in livestock feed manufacturing, egg production and poultry farming, will be the most closely watched IPO this year, as the listing of QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd has been shelved.
Potential investors found QSR Brand’s forward earnings multiple of some 25 times steep, and sluggish markets impacted the offering.
QSR Brands is the operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut chain of restaurants in Malaysia. 
It was supposed to have raised as much as US$500mil (RM2.07bil)."

“We do not expect the 5G roll-out to lift the telcos’ capex significantly, judging from South Korea’s recent 5G rollout,” it said, while maintaining its neutral rating on the sector. It added that for telco investors, the factors to watch for include the timing of the spectrum allocation, fees and capex.
“The Malaysian government has yet to announce the spectrum band to be allocated for 5G - the 3.5GHz band is currently use for the satellite communications. 
“Separately, we expect the allocation of 700MHz spectrum to take place by end-2019,” it said in a research report yesterday. 
While MCMC chairman Al-Ishsal Ishak has said that the government has no plans to profit from the award of the 5G spectrum, Affin Hwang believes that competition among the telcos, global trend and federal government’s plan to reduce budget deficits may still weigh on the spectrum fees."

The shares of Guan Chong Bhd  have soared more than 150% in the past year in Kuala Lumpur as profits doubled, making the producer of chocolate ingredients a top performer on the Bursa Malaysia Consumer Product Index. The MSCI All Country World Index of stocks is broadly flat in the past year.
For chief executive officer Brandon Tay Hoe Lian, Asia’s biggest cocoa bean processor has been riding a wave of improved margins and higher sales. 
Net income doubled to RM189.3mil last year, and 2019 “is looking as good as last year” because of increased capacity and sustained margins, he said in an interview last week.
“We’ve been experiencing strong demand since last year,” Tay said, which has helped the company increase the amount of forward sales. People are munching more dark chocolate, seen as an healthier alternative to ordinary snacks, and that’s boosting demand for cocoa, and exacerbating market tightness because of limited supplies of beans in Asia.
Shares of Guan Chong jumped almost 4% yesterday to RM3.84t, and headed for the highest close on record.
Going forward, Tay wants to move his processing plants closer to the bean-growing regions as he seeks to double grinding capacity over the next decade. That could mean venturing thousands of miles away to Africa or South America as bean production declines in Malaysia and Indonesia, he said.
“I can have additional expansion either in the bean-supply area or the customer area,” Tay said. 
“For us, the tendency is to go where the beans are. It’s a bit adventurous and some are reluctant to go, but then you’ll miss the chance,” he said. — Bloomberg"

The board of directors declared a first interim dividend of 4.3 sen a share, which was lower than 4.9 sen declared in the first quarter of last year.
In a statement yesterday, the telco said there was an increase of 50,000 postpaid subscribers to 2.9 million while prepaid subscribers dropped by about 450,000 to 8.4 million. 
This was reflected in the segments’ respective revenues whereby postpaid grew 13.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM671mil while the prepaid segment registered a fall of 13.7% over the previous corresponding quarter.
“Despite market competition, we are positioning Digi for long-term growth by improving prepaid sustainability, driving further postpaid growth, investing in our network, and creating digital platforms to add value for customers while executing a disciplined strategy focused on growth, efficiency and digital transformation,” said CEO Albern Murty.
In 1Q19, average revenue per user (ARPU) remained steady in the postpaid segment at RM71 while prepaid ARPU slid RM1 to RM29.
Overall, mobile service usage lost ground in 1Q19 with revenue slipping 2.8% y-o-y to RM1.44bil while Internet revenue climbed 13.3% y-o-y to RM862mil, representing 61.9% of service revenue.
Internet subscribers grew to 80% of Digi’s 11.3 million subscriber base. ARPU slipped RM1 to RM39 due to seasonal effect and changes in subscriber mix.
Meanwhile, cost of goods sold dropped 19.1% y-o-y due to seasonally lower device volume in transition to the enhance PF365 programme and reduction in regulated interconnect rate, said Digi.
Opex declined 0.4% y-o-y to RM490mil due to improved efficiencies in sales and marketing and operations and maintenance.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation moderated 6.7% y-o-y to RM723mil due to shift in prepaid mix and the seasonally lower device volume, while EBITDA margin increased to 48%.
Moving forward, the telco said it is working closely with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission and industry partners to explore modes of 5G implementation.
“In the recent 5G Malaysia showcase, we have presented use cases on how 5G technology can enable faster and better responses especially in emergencies that require precision data in real-time, augmented reality applications for future learning purposes and virtual reality gaming or eSports.
“In the coming months, Digi will set up base stations in the test bed at Putrajaya and is open to partner interested organisations to carry out field trials,” it said."

The Shenzhen-based firm, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker, also said its net profit margin was around 8% for the quarter, which it added was slightly higher than the same period last year. Huawei did not disclose its actual net profit.
The limited results announcement comes at a time when Washington has intensified a campaign against unlisted Huawei, alleging its equipment could be used for espionage and urging US allies to ban it from building next-generation 5G mobile networks.
Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations and launched an unprecedented media blitz by opening up its campus to journalists and making its typically low-key founder, Ren Zhengfei, available for media interviews.
The Chinese firm, which is also the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker, said last week the number of contracts it has won to provide 5G telecoms gear increased further despite the US campaign.
By the end of March, Huawei said it had signed 40 commercial 5G contracts with carriers, shipped more than 70,000 5G base stations to markets around the world and expects to have shipped 100,000 by May.
Huawei’s network business saw its first drop in revenue in two years in 2018. But Ren Zhengfei said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month that network equipment sales rose 15% while sales of the consumer business increased by more than 70% in the first quarter.
“These figures show that we are still growing, not declining,” Ren said.
Guo Ping, rotating chairman of the company, has said he expects all three business groups – consumer, carrier and enterprise – to post double-digit growth this year.
Huawei also said yesterday it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter. It did not disclose year-ago comparable figures, but according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Huawei shipped 39.3 million smartphones in the first quarter of 2018. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/23/rush-to-raise-cash-in-china-burning-stock-investors/,Rush to raise cash in China burning stock investors,Markets,"Tuesday, 23 Apr 2019",,"BEIJING: China’s cash-strapped companies are going to new lengths to raise money from the booming stock market, even if it comes at a cost to existing shareholders.
Nine firms have said they plan to raise a combined 40.5 billion yuan (US$6bil) through rights issues since January, almost twice the amount announced all of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes Tianqi Lithium Corp and Xinjiang Tianrun Dairy Co, whose shares slumped 5.4% and 10%  immediately after their respective announcements.
Chinese companies face restrictions on how much, how often and at what price they can sell new shares through private placements, the hitherto most popular method to raise money via the equity market. That’s sent them on a hunt for alternative funding tools, making the most of this year’s surging risk appetite. A rights issue, while subject to some of the same regulatory hurdles, allows for more freedom on pricing.
“Rights issues are the most effective way of equity refinancing at the moment due to strict restrictions on private placements,” said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities Co. “For the stock market, it’s never good news whenever refinancing shows up.”
LONGi Green Energy Technology Co invited existing shareholders earlier this month to buy new shares at a discount of about 80%. That’s even though Chinese equities entered a bull market. While companies may also opt to raise funds through a public placement, it’s a tool that’s still rarely used because issuers aren’t permitted to offer big discounts.
The surge in rights issues has underscored the dilemma facing the nation’s leaders as they seek to improve financing conditions for the private sector without jeopardizing the sustained rally in the stock market. The curbs on private placement were put in place in 2017, when new listings were picking up pace, alarming regulators that they may drag down the stock market by adding supply.
The Shanghai Composite Index has risen more than 30% this year through last Friday, the best-performing stock market in the world. The gauge fell 1.7%  on Monday, as investors turned cautious after China’s latest politburo meeting hinted that future policies may be less stimulative.
Some analysts warn the issuance could be a temporary drag on the equity market. Existing investors with no plans to participate in the offering prefer to sell their holdings rather than have their stake diluted, according to Kaiyuan’s Yang.
The flood of issuance elsewhere – including 207 billion yuan of convertible bonds and more than 80 applications to list on Shanghai’s new tech board – have also raised concerns over whether there’s enough money in the equity market to go around.“Rights issuance will continue to increase,” said Kaiyuan’s Yang. “The market is still recovering moderately and the volume of refinancing is generally acceptable.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/23/will-the-benettons-use-alitalia-to-fly-in-from-the-cold/,Will the Benettons use Alitalia to fly in from the cold?,Airlines,"Tuesday, 23 Apr 2019",,"MILAN: Italian transport group Atlantia could join a rescue of loss-making flag carrier Alitalia to try to win favour with the government and secure the future of its own domestic business following a deadly bridge collapse last year, sources said.
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, faces the loss of its entire national motorway concession in a bitter dispute with the government, which erupted after last year’s disaster on its toll network killed 43 people.
The government blamed Atlantia for the tragedy, saying it had failed to adequately maintain the ageing bridge, and vowed to revoke the concession, worth 58% of group revenue.
However, sources familiar with the matter said Atlantia could mend relations with the government by joining a rescue of Alitalia, which Rome is desperate to save, and possibly be rewarded with a reprieve on its motorway concession.
Atlantia has publicly scoffed at the idea, but sources say it stands ready if Rome signals a quid pro quo is possible. 
The government has not given such a signal but a political source says it may do if it sees Atlantia as key to saving Alitalia.
Atlantia, which also runs Alitalia’s main airport hub in Rome, has denied it is in talks to join a rescue consortium, saying its hands are already full with complex business challenges, including the fate of its motorway concession.
However, a source familiar with the flag-carrier’s thinking said Alitalia expected Atlantia to sign up to a rescue as early as this month. The source did not elaborate.
Atlantia declined to comment for this article.
Another potential investor in the rescue bid, state-owned rail group Ferrovie dello Stato, which has had initial talks with Atlantia, also believes the Benetton-controlled group could yet be tempted to join, said a source familiar with those talks.
“Atlantia’s door is not closed ... it is now up to the government to take the lead in the talks,” said a second source familiar with Alitalia’s thinking.
Alitalia, put into special administration in 2017 after workers rejected a previous rescue plan, needs to find investors ready to inject fresh funds by the end of April, in advance of an end-June repayment deadline for a state bridging loan of €900mil. 
That loan, however, may be rolled over, daily Il Sole 24 Ore said.
The government, formed by the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, is keen to save the airline because it wants to avoid mass layoffs at Alitalia, which has around 11,600 employees. However, political sources said it was still unclear whether the ruling coalition, especially the 5-Star party, would be ready to make such a peace with Atlantia. 
The party was the most critical of Atlantia after the bridge collapse.
“For 5-Star even the hypothesis of freezing the procedure for revoking the concession is not politically sustainable,” said a senior 5-Star source.
The prime minister’s office did not reply to a request for comment.
Ferrovie and Delta Air Lines are looking to invest in Alitalia but they still need to find other investors to stump up another €400mil for a rescue worth a total of around €1bil euros, sources close to the talks said.
Ferrovie and its adviser, investment bank Mediobanca, have discreetly sounded out Atlantia after being turned down by a string of other companies.
Reuters was unable to immediately reach a Delta spokeswoman.
Atlantia has been burnt by Alitalia once before, having lost €190mil when it participated in a rescue in 2008.
“We have many open fronts, we can’t afford to open a further, particularly complex one,” Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci said on Thursday, speaking to shareholders.
In addition to the bridge disaster, Castellucci said he was also dealing with the government over its lengthy approvals process which was blocking €4.9bil in group projects.
Some financial analysts say a quid pro quo would make sense.
“We reckon a possible agreement over Alitalia would be positive for Atlantia, because it would lead to a rapprochement with the government,” broker Equita said in a note this week.
For now, Ferrovie is ready to take a 30% stake in Alitalia, Delta Air Lines would invest €100mil for a stake of 10-15% and another 15% would probably go to the Italian treasury, sources familiar with the matter say.
But there is still a question mark over who would take the remaining 40-45% of the carrier.
British budget airline easyJet walked away from talks with Ferrovie last month, state-controlled defence group Leonardo and postal operator Poste Italiane said they were not interested in the deal.
If Ferrovie and Delta cannot find co-investors, Rome would face its least favoured option: a takeover by German carrier Lufthansa which has said it would only rescue Alitalia if the government were first to carry out major job cuts. — Reuters"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/23/price-cap-on-ron95-petrol-may-be-removed/,Price cap on RON95 petrol may be removed,Business News,"Tuesday, 23 Apr 2019",,"PUTRAJAYA: The cap on the price of RON95 petrol may be removed once the government subsidy, which is expected to be limited to recipients of the Bantuan Sara Hidup (BSH), comes into effect.
Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail told a media briefing that the government would decide later whether the cap would be maintained or not.
In February, the government announced that the price of RON95 petrol would be capped at RM2.08 for all users regardless of any increase in global oil prices.
“We have two options.
“We could remove the cap once the targeted subsidies come into effect, or we could maintain it. 
“The Cabinet has not decided on this yet.
“We will also have to decide on whether the targeted subsidies will be based on the current capped price, or on a float pricing system,” he said.
It was reported that the government was looking at introducing a targeted petrol subsidy to benefit BSH recipients, and banking in money directly into the accounts of those eligible each month.
Saifuddin said the ministry planned to use the BSH to finalise the number of those eligible for the aid, and was currently awaiting the updated information from the BSH secretariat before it can proceed.
The issue with the “banking-in” method, he said, was that currently, about 10% of individuals in the database did not have bank accounts.
The ministry, he said, had engaged with several banks to help these individuals, who are mostly located in rural areas, set up bank accounts for this purpose.
“If the Cabinet agrees that this method is best, we can immediately start disbursing the funds to recipients at the end of each month.
“We are keen on using this method, among other methods that have been proposed,” he told reporters yesterday.
If the method proves to be successful, he said, it would be extended to other future subsidies, such as for cooking oil and flour.
“The savings we get from this more efficient form of disbursement can be used to enable more Malaysians to enjoy the petrol subsidy – particularly the M40 group (middle 40%).
“This is the long-term plan,” he said.
Asked when the subsidy would come into effect, he said the ministry was awaiting the updated BSH database, which should be ready “very soon”.
“They are currently cleaning up the data and are at the final stages
“We want to ensure the data is credible – the deserving must be included and those who do not deserve assistance must be removed,” he said."

Speaking to reporters after the banking group’s annual general meeting, Tengku Zafrul said he was optimistic that Malaysia would be retained under FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index (WGBI), given the country’s role in the global bond market.This is expected to boost investor confidence in the domestic capital market.
He believes that index provider FTSE Russell will be convinced about Malaysia’s participation in the WGBI, with the engagement between FTSE Russell and the government over the review period of the next six months.
Tengku Zafrul’s comments on the WGBI came a few days after RHB Banking Group managing director Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli said the potential exclusion from WGBI is unlikely to have a material impact on Malaysia.
“The recent selloff in our markets was a result of investors’ knee-jerk reaction, as they turned more cautious on the news of the potential exclusion from the index. However, our bond market performance year-to-date is still positive.
“Once FTSE Russell starts to talk to all the players during the review period, I am sure they will agree that we should remain on the index. There will be some outflow from the market until a decision is made, as investors will prefer to stay on the sidelines. But generally, we have seen the worst already,” said Tengku Zafrul.
On April 15, FTSE Russell announced that Malaysia had been placed on its fixed-income watch list for six months until September 2019, following the completion of its first fixed-income country classification review.
“Malaysia, currently assigned a ‘2’ and included in the WGBI since 2004, is being considered for a potential downgrade to ‘1’, which would render Malaysia ineligible for inclusion in the WGBI,” said FTSE Russell in a statement.
FTSE Russell’s move to review Malaysian government bonds’ participation in the WGBI came a week after Norway’s US$1 trillion sovereign wealth fund was told to cut emerging-market government and corporate bonds, which includes Malaysia.
Tengku Zafrul was also optimistic about Malaysia’s economic growth trajectory and the outlook of the ringgit for full-year 2019.
“We maintain our forecast for the economic growth to be around 4.5% to 4.7% and we are also looking at the ringgit to strengthen to RM4.10 per US dollar by year-end,” he said.
Meanwhile, Tengku Zafrul pointed out that CIMB Group was working on at least three initial public offerings (IPOs) this year. The three IPOs are within the infrastructure and consumer sectors.
“We have a few in the pipeline which we hope will happen this year. The size would depend on the valuations,” he said, adding that CIMB Group was not involved in any IPO exercise in 2017.
On the banking group’s expected capital expenditure for financial year 2019, Tengku Zafrul said about RM900mil has been allocated to enhance its information technology (IT) and operations.
“We are increasing our investments in terms of IT and operations and so, we are going to triple our investments in these areas for resiliency and also for future-proofing the business.
“Given this, we are expecting a flat return on equity for 2019 as we are going to invest this year,” he added."

CIMB Research estimated the potential construction works value at between RM5bil and RM6bil based on the earlier estimated RM50bil to RM60bil gross development value assumption.
“The construction of 10,000 affordable homes and prioritising local content in the construction phase will enhance job flows over a period of time.
“While the return of Bandar Malaysia is a positive surprise, in terms of potentially catalysing new construction work and as the number of affordable housing units in the project has doubled from 5,000 to 10,000, the potential beneficiaries are likely limited to smaller/medium-sized building contractors for which tenders could be competitive,” the research house said in a report yesterday.
On Bursa Malaysia, construction stocks were actively traded with some counters, including Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd  (IWC) and Ekovest Bhd , hitting limit-up yesterday.
Since last week, the construction sector has been showered with positive news following the government’s decision to resume the Bandar Malaysia and East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) projects. 
The Bandar Malaysia project spanning over 486 acres will be jointly developed by the Iskandar Waterfront Holdings (IWH, 60%) and China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC, 40%) consortium with the government. 
IWC’s share price hit limit-up, jumping to a high of RM1.32  from its previous close of RM1.02 a share. Meanwhile, Ekovest soared  44.7% to 97 sen a share from its previous close of 67 sen last Friday. The counter was on the top volume list of Bursa Malaysia with 282 million shares being traded.
IWH, IWC and Ekovest are companies controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo.
He holds a 63% stake in IWH, while Kumpulan Prasaran Rakyat Johor Sdn Bhd owns the remaining 37%.
Meanwhile, both IWC and Ekovest advised investors to exercise caution in trading their shares. Both companies said in their respective filings yesterday that they were not involved in the reinstatement of the Bandar Malaysia project.			
DWL Resources Bhd, which last week entered into a pre-bid consortium agreement with Gadang Holdings Bhd  to jointly tender for and undertake infrastructure projects, rose 28.24% or 37 sen to RM1.68. 
Building materials – including cement manufacturer Lafarge Malaysia Bhd  – and steel players like Ann Joo Resources Bhd  and Mycron Steel Bhd  also gained from the positive news flow.
Public Investment Bank Bhd has identified construction giants such as Gamuda Bhd , IJM Corp Bhd  and WCT Holdings Bhd  as likely beneficiaries of the Bandar Malaysia project.
“Specialist contractors such as Advancecon Holdings Bhd for earthworks, Econpile Holdings Bhd  and Pintaras Jaya Bhd  for piling, and Lafarge and Tasek Corp Bhd  could also be beneficiaries,” it said in a note to clients.
It has also identified Malaysian Resources Corp  Bhd as a beneficiary for the transportation portion and MMC Corp Bhd  for the potential revival of the Bandar Malaysia MRT 2 underground stations.
AllianceDBS Research is bullish on the construction sector and expects the revival of Bandar Malaysia to likely be a precursor to the continuation of the high-speed rail project next year.
“We are certainly more positive on the sector now. Over the past week, two projects have been revived – the ECRL and Bandar Malaysia – potentially adding some RM88bil worth of order book replenishment opportunities,” it said."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/23/project-needs-more-push/,Project needs more push,Business News,"Tuesday, 23 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: The revival of Bandar Malaysia needs other catalysts to give it traction and to set it apart from other ongoing urban developments, according to a property consultant.
VPC Alliance Sdn Bhd managing director James Wong said the revival of the project should include the High Speed Rail (HSR) to Singapore and a digital hub.
The twin catalysts would give the project the needed pull factor to attract investments into the country, he said.
They would also set the development  apart in view of the current oversupply situation of virtually every sub-sectors of the real estate market, namely high-rise residential units, office and mall space.
“A new master plan is needed so as not to aggravate the current real estate oversupply in the Klang Valley,” he said.
Located on the former site of the Royal Malaysian Air Force base in Sungai Besi, the 486-acre Bandar Malaysia is less than 5km from the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX). TRX has 70 acres.
Both are legacies from 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

TRX straddles both sides of Jalan Tun Razak, with 57 acres currently being developed. The other 13 acres are on the opposite side of Jalan Tun Razak. TRX is being promoted as a regional financial centre. 
Wong said the twin catalysts, together with the transport links – MRT2 also stops at Bandar Malaysia -- would create the multiplier effect to spearhead its development. 
Tax reforms would make it the next urban jewel development emulating the success of the KL City Centre, Wong pointed out.
“A new master plan for Bandar Malaysia should be incorporated with the following features,” he said.
They are:
>  Reviving the HSR with Bandar Malaysia as its terminal to maximise its potential as a transit-oriented development; 
> A digital economy by inviting tech giants such as Apple, Huawei and Alibaba to set up their information technology, robotic and artificial intelligence centres there;
>  Developing factory outlets instead of shopping malls as there are too many retail malls in the Klang Valley. A different sort of retail approach is needed in Bandar Malaysia;
> A medical tourism hub where medical tourists and their families can be with their loved ones, with the top grade public and private amenities at their disposal; 
>  Promoting it as world financial centre by inviting Fortune 500 companies and multinational companies to relocate their regional and Asian headquarters there, and
> Developing multi-level modern warehouses logistics centres as well as small and medium enterprise parks.
As for the 10,000 units of affordable housing, property consultancy PPC International managing director Datuk Siders Sittampalam said: “In this grand scheme of things – this is a momentous, ambitious and excellent idea – the government needs to do some studies as 10,000 is a sizeable figure.”
He hoped it would not fizzle out as was the case in the former Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM) land in Sungai Buloh.
Before the Employees Provident Fund finalised purchase of the 2,330 acres of RRIM land, subsequently renamed Kwasa Damansara, in 2011/2012 the market was abuzzed with affordable units being built there. 
The mass rail transit depot and line were being built then and there was talk that affordable units would enable the lower income group to buy transport-oriented housing. 
The market reached its peak in 2012 and there was concern about the lack of affordable properties then, he said.
It fizzled out and the land was carved out and sold to private developers at a high cost and whatever nuances of affordability vanished, he said.
Siders also asked if the sale of the houses would come with conditions, as with PR1MA (Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia) units. 
The current focus on the once-mothballed project has also threw focus on TRX and how it would be impacted.
A TRX City Sdn Bhd spokesperson said: “TRX is a long-term project of between 15 and 20 years. 
“It will contribute to the economic growth of the country in the long run.
“It is a phased development, and we will build only when there is a demand. 
“We do not do speculative development and have no intention of flooding the market,” the statement said.
“Prime grade A office towers in TRX, with specifications of the highest international standards, continue to be in demand in Kuala Lumpur,” the statement said, adding that TRX combines world-class connectivity, public realms and lifestyle offerings within one district."

Alliance Bank group chief executive officer Joel Kornreich said the partnership would strengthen the bank’s capability to provide a comprehensive suite of protection solutions targeting individuals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). 
“The offering of general insurance and takaful solutions will allow us to cater to our customers’ specific needs, greater accessibility, as well as when and where needed,” he told reporters after inking the 15-year bancassurance and bancatakaful agreements yesterday. 
In the last three years, Alliance Bank’s general insurance business has grown by 14% year-on-year.
Beginning May 1, Kornreich disclosed that fire insurance and takaful would be the first product offered for individuals and commercial property owners followed by other business and personal insurance plans in the next six months.  “Any products that Zurich offers for consumers and SMEs, Alliance Bank will take it and provide to its customers because we want to innovate as well,” he said. 
For the first year of partnership, Zurich General Insurance chief executive officer David Fike revealed that around six to 12 general insurance and takaful products would be rolled out. 
Zurich Malaysia offers a wide range of general conventional and takaful products to Malaysians. 
Currently, it is ranked 7th  largest general insurance and takaful company in Malaysia, holding a market share of 5% in the country. 
The bancassurance and takaful collaboration with Alliance Bank is Zurich’s first bank partnership in the country. 
According to industry reports, the general insurance industry posted a growth of 1.5% in 2018, while the general takaful industry recorded a 8.9% growth on the back of higher premiums and contributions from its two largest classes, motor and fire.
Given a low general insurance gap penetration of 1.23% of Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP), Fike said the company would address the issue of providing non-insured and under-insured customers. 
“We believe that there is a lot of room for growth opportunities in the market looking at the low rate of penetration. We have an obligation here to help consumers and businesses in the country,” he added."

“One of Public Bank’s key focus in the area of sustainability is responsible lending, particularly in providing financing for first time home buyers and supporting the financing needs of the SME segment,” he said in a statement.
“With a lending portfolio for residential properties and SMEs amounting to RM110.5bil and RM69.5bil respectively as at the end of 2018, Public Bank is the largest domestic financier for these two key segments today,” Teh added.
He said that the bank had continued to proactively participate in a broad range of government and Bank Negara initiated financing schemes for affordable homes and support of the SMEs.
Meanwhile, Public Bank’s MD and CEO Tan Sri Tay Ah Lek said that there will only be a minimal impact upon Public Bank Bhd should Bank Negara decide to lower the overnight policy rate (OPR).
“There will only be a small and only temporary impact on the net interest margins which is insignificant compared to the overall earnings of the bank,” he said to a question at the company’s AGM in the capital city yesterday.
“The temporary impact is due to the time lag for the repricing of the existing fixed deposits. This is a very insignificant impact to our earnings,” Tay added. 
Commenting on the bank’s digitalisation initiatives, Teh said that the bank had already invested about RM400mil on IT-related capital expenditure, which includes spending on digital infrastructure. 
“Of this amount, about RM90mil was spent specifically on fintech-related initiatives.
“Going forward, the Bank is planning to invest another RM600mil in the next three years to further enhance ICT infrastructure, digital capability and knowledge,” he said. 
Public Bank said it is currently working on several fintech initiatives such as Big Data Analytics, Open API, eKYC, and blockchain. Public Bank also said it has implemented several initiatives for digital payment services in line with latest industry trends, such as AliPay, Samsung Pay, WeChat Pay and DuitNow. 
For new customers, the bank has also implemented the eSignature at all branches, which has significantly reduced the time taken to sign up new customer.
“Accelerating digitalisation is one of the Public Bank’s key focus area. The bank takes a practical approach in its pursuit of digital initiatives, going along customers’ needs and their readiness to adopt digital-driven services, at the same time mindful of the associated risks such as cyber security threat, and the short life cycle of application as a result of rapid advancement in technology,” Teh said.
The bank said it will also continue to expand its market presence in Vietnam and is planning to open eight new branches this year in the country, subject to regulatory approval. “We have been actively growing its business in Vietnam through the expansion of branches. The bank opened five new branches in 2018, bringing the total branches to 18,” Teh said."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/23/ghosn-indicted-on-new-charges-in-japan/,Ghosn indicted on new charges in Japan,Business News,"Tuesday, 23 Apr 2019",,"TOKYO: Carlos Ghosn (pic) was indicted on new charges of misdirecting company money for his personal use, the most serious allegations yet against the former chairman who once led the alliance between Nissan Motor Co, Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
Using foreign corporate entities in 2017 and 2018, Nissan lost US$5mil that was funnelled into accounts controlled by Ghosn, Japanese prosecutors said in a one-page statement yesterday. 
While that was less than the amount they initially indicated when they arrested Ghosn again earlier this month, the allegations are the first to suggest that the former global auto executive directly transferred money from the company for personal gain.
After Ghosn’s first arrest, Nissan and Renault uncovered payments made through companies in Oman and Lebanon that allegedly were used for his personal gain, including corporate jets and a yacht.
Ghosn’s lawyers immediately applied for his release on bail. He briefly won his freedom in March, but was arrested and jailed again on new allegations that eventually led to the charges yesterday. 
The executive, widely credited with saving Nissan from failure and bringing it together with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, was first arrested in November, sending shock waves across Japan, France and the global auto industry.
The former chairman has denied the prior charges against him, blaming them on “a very dirty game” by Nissan executives determined to oust him from the alliance. Ghosn has vigorously denied the previously filed indictments against him for transferring personal trading losses to Nissan, under-reporting his income and falsifying documents.
Shin Kukimoto, deputy chief prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, declined to comment on Ghosn’s request for release on bail.
Earlier yesterday, Nissan filed a criminal complaint against Ghosn for his actions. 
The Yokohama-based automaker sent a statement to prosecutors saying that it determined that payments made by Nissan to an overseas vehicle sales company via a subsidiary “were in fact directed by Ghosn for his personal enrichment and were not necessary from a business standpoint,” Nissan said in a statement.
“Nissan is requesting appropriately strict penalties,” the automaker said in the statement. “Nissan takes this unfortunate situation very seriously and again expresses sincere regret for any concern caused to our valued stakeholders.”
Nissan, which swiftly removed Ghosn as chairman days after his first arrest, is seeking to turn over a tumultuous chapter in its ties with Renault. The detention of the former global auto titan threatened to derail their partnership, the world’s biggest auto alliance. 
Since then the three partners set up a new governance structure, led by Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, designed for smoother and more equitable decision-making.
Another lengthy stay in prison, with limited access to his lawyers, could make it harder for Ghosn to prepare for a trial that may start later this year or next year. Suspects in Japan routinely endure lengthy pre-trial detentions and repeated grillings by prosecutors without legal counsel.
Periodically rearresting a suspect on suspicion of new charges lets prosecutors keep the suspect in custody while attempting to build a case or secure a confession. Given that Monday’s charges don’t cover the full timeframe of earlier allegations by prosecutors, it’s possible that they will file additional indictments.
When he was first jailed, Ghosn lost 7kg and underwent hours of questioning daily. 
Two of Ghosn’s daughters told the New York Times in December that his cell wasn’t heated, that he had asked repeatedly for blankets and that he had been denied pen and paper. Another extended stay could refocus international attention on the workings of Japan’s criminal justice system.
In a video released after he was detained again, Ghosn said he was worried about getting a fair trial. The 65-year-old called his rearrest “outrageous and arbitrary,” accused people at Nissan, whom he didn’t identify, of trying to silence him, and declared: “I will not be broken.” — Bloomberg"

Both sides have sped up market access and strengthened regulatory cooperation since a memorandum of understanding was signed in October, Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in a statement yesterday. While he didn’t say when the so-called ETF Connect would start operating, Nikkei previously reported that this could be as early as May.
China is pressing ahead with plans to allow more foreign investors into its market, including those from historical rival Japan, before Xi Jinping makes his first visit to the country as president for the Group of 20 summit in June. 
The ETF link would allow some of the trillions of dollars stashed away by Japanese savers to flow into the world’s best-performing stock market.
The Shanghai Composite Index has risen almost 30% this year, the biggest gain among more than 90 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Inflows are expected to increase after MSCI Inc said it will more than quadruple the weighting of China-listed equities in a benchmark index.

The view from BofAML lends itself to a debate over Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) reserves, with one school of thought believing that the monetary authority holds surplus capital that can be handed over to the government and the other saying the RBI has insufficient reserves.
BofAML’s note comes as the panel led by former central bank governor Bimal Jalan prepares to submit its report in the coming weeks. While finance ministry officials have supported transfer of surplus reserves to help the government meet budget goals, a central bank-backed think tank found that the RBI’s capital buffer that’s below the global average capital to asset ratio.
“Our stress tests throw up a range of one trillion rupees plus only from contingency reserves,” Indranil Sen Gupta, chief India economist at BofAML, said in the note. According to him, India’s central bank maintains higher contingency reserves as a percentage of its total book compared to its peers in Brazil, Russia and South Africa and a lower cap will release more funds. — Bloomberg"

“Management attributed the lower sales to prolonged demand weakness in power management chip packages used in consumer applications and excess inventory for automotive customers.

Separate data showed retail sales picked up in March and labour demand remains the strongest in decades, but these positive figures are unlikely to ease policymakers' concerns about a slowdown in global trade flows.

Factory output fell 0.9 percent in March, data by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) showed, more than a median estimate for a 0.1 percent decline in a Reuters poll of economists. That followed a 0.7 percent increase in February.

The mounting pressure on Japan's economy from weak external demand has hurt exports and threatens corporate profits, which could weigh on capital expenditure and make it more difficult to keep growth on track, analysts say.

Industrial output fell in March due to a 3.4 percent decline in car output and a 6.7 percent decline in the production of machines used to make semiconductors and flat-panel displays, the data showed.

In another source of concern, inventories rose 1.6 percent in March, the fastest increase in a year, due to higher inventories of metals, plastics, and heavy equipment.

The rise in inventories suggests makers of these goods could curb output in the future.

Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect production to rise 2.7 percent in April and 3.6 percent in May, but METI changed its assessment of output to say it is weakening recently.

Retail sales - a key gauge of private consumption that makes up about 60 percent of the economy - rose 1.0 percent in March from a year earlier, more than a 0.8 percent annual gain expected by economists.

Friday's batch of data comes a day after the Bank of Japan said it would keep interest rates low for at least another year, in a move to dispel uncertainty over its commitment to support the economy and drive inflation.

Japan's policymakers are nervously monitoring developments overseas but have few policy options if weakness in the global economy continues to damage the country's outlook, some economists say.

The Sino-U.S. trade war has also had a negative effect on domestic growth, as a slowing Chinese economy curbed demand for mobile phone parts and chip-making equipment from Japan.

Uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union and jittery global financial markets have added to a growing list of worries for policymakers.

Additional data released on Friday showed Japan's jobless rate edged up to 2.5 percent in March from 2.3 percent previously, and job availability held steady at 1.63 per applicant, hovering at a 44-year high.

Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose an annual 1.3 percent in April from a year earlier, more than the median estimate for a 1.1 percent annual increase. - Reuters"

LDC, one of the world's biggest crop merchants, has said it wants to increase its presence in food processing and has cited regional partnerships as a way to expand.

Malaysia-based Leong Hup International on Thursday launched an initial public offering (IPO) that aims to raise as much as 1.2 billion ringgit ($290.31 million), saying it had secured 10 cornerstone investors, including LDC.

An LDC spokeswoman declined to comment on the potential size of its investment in the IPO. A source familiar with the deal said the cornerstone investors would each have less than 5 percent of the capital.

Leong Hup is one of the largest fully integrated producers of poultry, eggs and livestock feed in Southeast Asia, and also operates in Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines and Singapore.

""LDC's cornerstone investment in LHI's IPO is in line with LDC's strategy to diversify further downstream and strengthen our footprint in growth markets by partnering with key players in the feed, food and nutrition value chain,"" Louis Dreyfus Chief Executive Ian McIntosh said in a statement.

The move marks LDC's first investment in livestock production and would build on its activity as a supplier of bulk animal-feed ingredients, the spokeswoman added.

McIntosh said in March that LDC had formed a joint venture to produce fish feed at an oilseed processing factory in China that it took over last year.

LDC will also buy a stake in Luckin Coffee Inc as part of a U.S. IPO planned by the Chinese chain.

The investment via a private share placement is related to a joint venture to build and operate a coffee roasting plant in China.

LDC, often known as Dreyfus, is the 'D' of the so-called ""ABCD"" quartet of global crop merchants, which also include Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill.

The majors have all been expanding in food processing and ingredients in the face of declining margins for buying and selling crops.

LDC is among the trading houses which have suffered from a depressed sugar market, and this month announced a new chairman for its loss-making Brazilian sugar subsidiary Biosev. - Reuters"

The People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate, which restricts the onshore yuan’s moves by 2 percent on either side, at 6.7307 per dollar. The fixing was stronger than all forecasts that 17 traders and analysts offered to Bloomberg in the morning. The yuan rose 0.18 percent to 6.7325 a dollar as of 10:22 a.m. in Shanghai.

”It could be a signal from the authorities that they do not want the yuan to be too weak,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore.

China will not depreciate the yuan in a way that harms other countries, and the currency will be kept basically stable at reasonable levels, Xi said about an hour after the fixing at the Belt and Road forum in Beijing.

The surprising fixing comes as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to travel to Beijing for trade negotiations with China next week.

Xi's plan to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with huge spending on infrastructure, has become mired in controversy as some partner nations have bemoaned the high cost of projects.

China has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap anyone with debt and only has good intentions, and has been looking to use this week's summit in Beijing to recalibrate the policy and address those concerns.

Xi said in a keynote speech to the summit that environmental protection must underpin the scheme ""to protect the common home we live in"".

""We must adhere to the concept of openness, greenness, and cleanliness,"" he said.

""Operate in the sun and fight corruption together with zero tolerance,"" Xi added.

""Building high-quality, sustainable, risk-resistant, reasonably priced, and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to fully utilise their resource endowments.""

Western governments have tended to view it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad, saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt.

While most of the Belt and Road projects are continuing as planned, some have been caught up by changes in government in countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives.

Those that have been shelved for financial reasons include a power plant in Pakistan and an airport in Sierra Leone, and Beijing has in recent months had to rebuff critics by saying that not one country has been burdened with so-called 

""debt traps"".

Since 2017, the finance ministries of 28 countries have called on governments, financial institutions and companies from Belt and Road countries to work together to build a long-term, stable and sustainable financing system to manage risks, China's finance ministry said in a report released on Thursday.

Debt sustainability has to be taken into account when mobilising funds, the finance ministry said in the report, which outlined a framework for use in analysing debt sustainability of low-income Belt and Road nations and managing debt risks.

The framework is based on the IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries while pencilling in local conditions and development of partner nations, according to the report.

CHINESE PROMISES

The Belt and Road initiative will also open up development opportunities for China just as China itself is further opening up its markets to the world, Xi said.

""In accordance with the need for further opening up, (we'll) improve laws and regulations, regulate government behaviour at all levels in administrative licensing, market supervision and other areas, and clean up and abolish unreasonable regulations, subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market,"" he said.

Xi promised to significantly shorten the negative list for foreign investments, and allow foreign companies to take a majority stake or set up wholly-owned companies in more sectors.

Tariffs will be lower and non-tariff barriers will be eliminated, Xi added.

China also aims to import more services and goods, and is willing to import competitive agricultural products and services to achieve trade balance.

""China will strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination with major economies in the world and strive to create positive spillover effects to promote a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth for the world economy,"" said Xi.

VISITING LEADERS

Visiting leaders include Russia's Vladimir Putin, as well as Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, a close China ally and among the biggest recipients of Belt and Road investment, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, which recently became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative.

The United States, which has not joined the Belt and Road, is expected to send only lower-level officials, and nobody from Washington, citing concerns over opaque financing practices, poor governance, and disregard for internationally accepted norms.

""The United States is not sending high level officials from Washington to the Belt and Road Forum,"" a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said.

However, economists say any decline in Japanese GDP is likely to be temporary as Washington and Beijing edge toward an agreement to end punitive tariffs and China's economy shows signs of stabilisation due to government stimulus.

The sharp decline in Japan's output highlights the extent of the damage caused by the trade war, but economists are optimistic the world's third-largest economy can quickly bounce back as global growth remains on relatively firm footing.

""The first quarter looks like a contraction, because output, exports, and business investment are all likely to be weak,"" said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.

""Still, we already see a turnaround in China, and that will lift manufacturing globally. The worst is already over for Japan, so I would not get pessimistic.""

Industrial output in January-March tumbled 2.6 percent, the biggest decline since April-June 2014, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) showed on Friday. That followed a 1.4 percent expansion in the previous quarter.

On a monthly basis, output fell 0.9 percent in March, more than a median estimate for a 0.1 percent decline in a Reuters poll of economists, and versus a 0.7 percent rise in February.

The mounting pressure on Japan's economy from weak external demand has hurt exports and threatens corporate profits, which could weigh on capital expenditure in the first quarter, analysts say.

In another source of concern, inventories rose 1.6 percent in March, the fastest increase in a year, due to higher inventories of metals, plastics, and heavy equipment.

The rise in inventories suggests makers of these goods could curb output in the future.

Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect production to rise 2.7 percent in April and 3.6 percent in May, but a METI official said it downgraded its assessment of output to say it is weakening recently.

Japan's exports weakened at the start of the year as Washington and Beijing slapped tariffs on each other's goods in a dispute over the U.S. trade deficit. Japanese companies are exposed because they sell a lot electronic parts and manufacturing equipment to companies in China.

The trade war initially caused China's economy to wobble, but the world's second-largest economy defied expectations for a slowdown in the first quarter, raising hope for other countries that rely on Chinese demand. South Korea's export-reliant economy, however, unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter as companies slashed investment and trade slumped.

Separate data on Friday showed Japan's retail sales - a key gauge of private consumption that makes up about 60 percent of the economy - rose 1.0 percent in March from a year earlier, more than a 0.8 percent annual gain expected by economists.

The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies stood at 98.123 after advancing to 98.322 on Thursday, its highest since May 2017.

Data on Thursday showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased by the most in eight months in March. That follows other recent U.S. data that show strength in retail sales and exports which have eased fears of a sharp slowdown in the world's biggest economy.

According to a Reuters survey of economists, data to be released at 1230 GMT on Friday will probably show GDP increased 2.0 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, slightly slower that the 2.2 percent posted in the previous quarter.

""We expect the GDP data to underline steady economic recovery,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.

""Differences in economic fundamentals is a key driver for currencies now that the Fed - and more recently the Swedish and Japanese central banks - have adopted a dovish stance,"" Kadota added.

Sweden's central bank said on Thursday that recent weak inflationary pressures meant an interest rate hike would come slightly later than it had planned, sending the Swedish crown to a 17-year low.

In a move to dispel any doubt over its commitment to ultra-loose policies, the Bank of Japan on Thursday put a time frame on its forward guidance for the first time by telling investors that it would keep interest rates at super-low levels for at least one more year.

The dollar was nearly flat at 111.64 yen after shedding 0.5 percent overnight.

The greenback has poked above 112.00 yen several times this month without building a strong enough foothold above the threshold, which has become a key technical resistance level.

While the dollar has been caught in narrow range against the yen through most of April, Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief FX strategist at Daiwa Securities, sees the next significant move would see the dollar strengthen.

""The Chinese PMI and the U.S. non-farm jobs report are due over the next week and both are expected to be quite good. There is also the next round of U.S.-China trade talks, which could further lift risk sentiment,"" Imaizumi said.

""The market could thus see a significant increase in 'risk on' during the Japanese holidays, pushing dollar/yen towards 113.00 yen.""

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing for trade talks beginning on April 30.

Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said this week that the talks were making progress and that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the prospects for striking a deal.

Debt coming due: S$100 million bond due March 18, 2020

The logistics company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed CWT International Ltd., paid its bond due on April 18 but its parent’s problems have cast a shadow.

CWT International earlier this month defaulted on a loan and lenders have seized the company’s assets, including its stake in CWT Pte. An auditors’ report contained in CWT International’s 2018 annual results said there could be “material uncertainties” within the firm that “may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.”

Since it was bought in 2017 by CWT International, a unit of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co., there’s been less visibility on the issuer’s financials. CWT Pte had S$276 million of cash and a net cash position of S$135 million as of 

financial year 2018, according to a company overview on its website.

A spokesman for CWT Pte declined to comment.

But the group has suffered setbacks and in January, it said a special audit of Blackgold International, a Chinese coal-mining group it acquired in July 2017, has revealed lapses. A fact-finding investigation by EY Advisory showed 2.05 billion yuan ($305 million) in overstated sales, the firm also said in January.

Cash and equivalents stood at S$59.9 million as of Jan. 31, according to the company’s filing. Its total debt came to S$332.8 million, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The group said in a March filing it’s currently seeking permanent waivers for loan covenant breaches resulting from the “Blackgold event.”

In response to questions, Vibrant’s chief financial officer Francis Lee referred Bloomberg to the result of its extraordinary general meeting on April 18, where shareholders “passed a resolution approving the disposal of our property with gross sales proceeds of S$227.5 million.”

Oxley Holdings Ltd.

Debt coming due: S$300 million bonds due Nov. 5, 2019; S$150 million notes due May 18, 2020; S$150 million debt due Jan 31, 2022 

This Singapore developer has been cutting leverage but its debt load is still high. Oxley said in a filing last month that it accepted an “expression of interest” from a U.S.-based fund to buy a unit that owns Chevron House at Raffles 

Place for S$1.025 billion. However, the expression of interest isn’t legally binding and subject to due diligence.

Its efforts to sell assets have faced some difficulties. The firm terminated a letter of intent to sell its two hotels to Gracious Land for S$950 million in March, prompting a slump in its share price.

“We are confident to redeem the bonds come November 2019. Presently, the Company has commenced its deleveraging exercise and we expect to demonstrate the positive results in near term,” an external spokesman for Oxley said.

The firm had total debt of S$3.9 billion and cash and cash equivalents of S$248.5 million as of Dec. 31, 2018, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

Neptune Orient Lines

Debt coming due: S$280 million bonds due Sept. 9, 2020; S$300 million notes due June 22, 2021

Since Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. was bought by French shipping firm CMA CGM SA in 2016, there has been less visibility on the firm. NOL had a net loss after tax of $134 million for its financial year 2018, while its total debt stood at 

$2.6 billion and total cash at $134 million as of Dec. 31, according to unaudited figures included in a presentation on its website.

CMA CGM’s leverage is likely to climb as it raised its ownership in Ceva Logistics AG, according to an OCBC Credit Research in a report dated March 6.

The bank also sees “further downside risks” stemming from the rise in protectionism and trade tensions. Global container volume plunged 7.7 percent in February, the steepest decline on record, as volumes were undermined by a slowing global economy, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

A spokeswoman for APL, a unit of NOL, didn’t immediately respond to emails and a call.

Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust

Debt coming due: S$75 million notes due June 22, 2020; S$120 million 6.6 percent perpetual bonds; S$140 million 7 percent perpetual securities

Investor sentiment toward Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust has improved thanks to its sponsor PT Lippo Karawaci’s plans to raise $1 billion to cut debt. But the trust’s exposure to Lippo Karawaci remains a concern for investors, who are waiting for a $730 million rights offer to be completed.

Lippo Karawaci’s shareholders this month approved the right issue, which is underwritten by the billionaire Riady family in Southeast Asia. The rights issue is expected to be completed by the first half of 2019, according to a spokesperson for Lippo Malls.

Income derived from Lippo Karawaci master leases only accounted for 8.2 percent of Lippo Malls’ first quarter 2019 gross revenue and the rest of related party tenants made up 15.6 percent, according to the spokesperson.

As of March 31, Lippo Malls’ gearing ratio stood at 33.9 percent, well below the mandated 45 percent and the trust “will continue to be pro-active in capital management so as to fulfill all refinancing requirements,” the spokesperson said. - Bloomberg"

In its preliminary operating statistics released Friday, the budget airline said its capacity rose 17% to 14.26 million from 12.2 million in the same period a year ago. 

“AirAsia’s consolidated AOCs posted strong first quarter growth to kick start the year, driven by a substantial increase in capacity of 17% year-on-year. 

“Load held strong at 88% with passengers carried up 18% to 12 million pax. Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) grew by 11% year-on-year as the company added new routes and frequencies for both domestic and international routes to further grow its market share,” it said in a statement. 


Malaysia added substantial capacity of 11% with most of the seats sold as passengers carried was up by 10% to 8.7 million pax year-on-year. Load held strong at 87%.

Indonesia reported an overall improved operating statistics, primarily attributed to eight aircraft that were transferred from PT. Indonesia AirAsia Extra to AirAsia Indonesia in 4Q2018. 

For the quarter under review, total passengers carried saw an increase of 66%, exceeding the 52% capacity added and recorded a load factor of 87%, which grew 7 percentage points (ppts) year-on year.

Philippines added 17% in capacity on new international routes. AirAsia said the aggressive increase in capacity did not result in any dilution to the load, on the contrary load factor further grew by 4 ppts to 91%. This was backed by solid passenger growth of 23% year-on year.

AirAsia said Thailand saw an improvement and witnessed the return of tourist arrivals in the first quarter resulting from the extension of the Visa on Arrival fee waiver scheme for visitors from 20 countries and one territory. 

It added that ASK was up by 10% year-on-year on the back of capacity that was added for China and Indochina routes. Whilst, number of passengers carried was in line with the capacity added, recording a strong load factor of 90%.

""Despite the oil price stability, project sanctions and materialisation of work orders are slower than expected especially in the offshore fabrication segment, affecting the replenishment of orderbook,"" the group said in a stock exchange filing.

According to the group, 1QFY19 net loss grew 16.2% to RM29.37mil from RM25.27mil in the comparative quarter although revenue rose to RM203.11mil, 7.9% over RM188.26mil in the same quarter last year.

The bulk of the revenue was contributed by the heavy engineering segment, which rose 13% to RM125.4mil due to the higher progress of ongoing projects in the current quarter.

However, operating loss in the segment nearly doubled to RM23.9mil from RM12.8mil over a year earlier due to higher unabsorbed overheads as expected contract awards had yet to materialise.

In the marine segment, revenue was marginally higher at RM77.7mil while operating loss similarly rose slightly to RM7.5mil.

MMHE said its marine segment is making a recovery as it expects more dry docking activities at its yard owing to the growth in global sea trade.

""During the period under review, the Group has received more orders for LNG repairs compared to last year and is positive of maintaining current level of marine repair activities for this year,"" it said.

It announced on Friday net profit rose 54% to RM409mil from RM266mil despite a 9% decline in revenue at RM2.23bil from RM2.44bil.

When compared with Q1 FY18, net profit for the quarter just ended fell by 21.8% from RM523mil. Its revenue dipped to RM2.232bil from RM2.237bil a year ago. 

Earnings per share were 5.2 sen compared with 6.7 sen. It rewarded shareholders with a dividend of five sen a share.

Q1 FY19 vs Q4 FY18 (in parenthesis)

Maxis said in Q1 FY19, service revenue decreased by 4.9% to RM1.947bil (RM2.048bil).

This decrease was largely driven by two factors namely –  reduced average revenue per user (Arpu) in both postpaid and prepaid. 

The reduced Arpu in both postpaid and prepaid was due to the new lower mobile termination rates (MTR) reducing MTR based revenue and termination of a network sharing agreement.

Service revenue, excluding wholesale revenue, was RM1.876bil (RM1.930bil).

Postpaid service revenue fell by 5% to RM1bil (RM1.053bil) due to higher RGS base being offset by a lower ARPU; and termination of a network sharing agreement ending in December with limited roll over in to 2019. 

The postpaid RGS grew by 126,000 -- a 4% increase to 3.261 million (3.135 million) contributed mainly by growth in the MaxisONE Plan subscriber base. 

“Our Hotlink Postpaid Flex and MaxisONE Share offering continued to attract entry level Postpaid subscribers, as well as those migrating from Prepaid to Postpaid. 

“Postpaid Arpu decreased to RM88 (RM94) for the quarter as a result of decreasing MTR and seasonality of roaming. Postpaid smartphone penetration stood at 88% (87%) and data usage remained consistent at 12.2GB (12.2GB).

Prepaid service revenue declined by 5.7% to RM797mil (RM845mil). Prepaid RGS dipped by 143,000, a 2.2% reduction to 6.467 million subscribers. 

“We continue to see SIM consolidation and migration from prepaid to postpaid,” it said. 

Prepaid Arpu fell by 4.8% from RM42 to RM40 per month. Similar to postpaid, the decline in Arpu was a result of reduced MTR and seasonality in IDD call patterns. 

Prepaid smartphone penetration stood at 84% against 83% in the previous quarter and data usage increased to 11.5GB (10.4GB).

Normalised earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) increased by 24.1% to RM953mil with a normalised Ebita margin on service revenue of 48.9% (RM768mil, normalised Ebitda margin on service revenue of 37.5%)  as Q4 FY18 was impacted by one-offs of about RM250mil.

Normalised profit rose 56% to RM404mil from RM259mil while capex was lower at RM127mil from RM524mil.

Q1 FY19 vs Q1 FY18 

Maxis said its service revenue for Q1FY19 of RM1.947bil was 1.7% lower than RM1.98bil a year ago.

“This was largely contributed by the decline in prepaid RGS, overall reduction in Arpu, and termination of a network sharing agreement, offset by the growth in Postpaid RGS and Home Fibre RGS,” it said.

However, postpaid service revenue grew by 1.5% to RM1bil compared to RM985mil a year ago. 

The growth was supported by the solid increase in subscriber base of 349,000 to 3.261mil (Q1FY18: 2.912mil).

Maxis said prepaid service revenue declined by 6.1% to RM797mil from RM849mil on the back of a lower subscription base which was impacted by the continued SIM consolidation, migration from Prepaid to Postpaid and reduced MTR.

The number of subscribers fell by 319,000 from 6.786 million in Q1FY18 to 6.467 million.

It pointed out mobile internet revenue contributed to the stable underlying Arpu of RM40 per month. 

Normalised Ebitda fell by 6.6% to RM953mil from RM1.02bil. The Ebitda margin on service revenue was 48.9% compared with 51.5%.

“The rebasing of the Ebitda is due to factors including the termination of a network sharing agreement, continued investment in FibeNation and mobilsation of trhe enterprise business growth opportunities,”Maxis said."

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Buffett had said in his February annual letter to shareholders that over time Berkshire would likely be a ""significant"" buyer of its own stock, when it traded below the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's estimate of its intrinsic value.

Berkshire repurchased $1.3 billion of its stock last year, after Buffett loosened the company's buyback criteria.

The buybacks began in part because of Buffett's inability to make a major acquisition, a significant reason Berkshire ended 2018 with $111.9 billion of cash and equivalents.

In the interview, Buffett ""waved off"" the idea of paying a shareholder dividend.

He also lamented the prospect of a time when Berkshire's stock traded at a fair price, and other companies and stocks also looked expensive. ""That's my nightmare,"" he said.

Berkshire's market value is more than $520 billion, based on reported shares outstanding.

Buffett, 88, has run Berkshire since 1965, and has not publicly signalled any intention to stop.

""I have more fun here than I think any 88-year-old is having, virtually, in the world,"" he said in the interview from Berkshire's headquarters. - Reuters"

UPS fell 8.1% and the industrial sector slid 2%, while Facebook gained 5.8% and Microsoft Corp rose 3.3%.

The Dow industrials fell 1% at one point, dragged down by a 13% plunge in 3M shares after the company reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, cut its 2019 earnings forecast and said it would lay off 2,000 workers globally.

Asian markets slid earlier in the day, losing 0.5% as South Korea's economy unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter, a reminder of economic fragility outside the United States.

Shanghai's bourse also fell late in the day, losing more than 2% on the latest central bank efforts to temper expectations for further monetary policy easing.

Chinese officials also warned of protracted pressure on economic growth, casting a shadow over hopes for a sustained recovery in the world's second-biggest economy.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback versus a basket of six major peers, held near its highest level since May 2017. The index was up 0.1%.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.48% versus the greenback at 111.63 per dollar.

The Turkish lira weakened 0.95% against the dollar after Turkey's central bank left interest rates unchanged at 24% but in a dovish shift dropped a previous reference to possible further tightening if needed to address inflation.

U.S. Treasury yields rose as investors piled into the safe-haven government bonds following a dovish report from Canada's central bank and solid demand at auction for $41 billion of new five-year notes.

Rating: Buy
Target price: RM1.49
AllianceDBS Research is keeping a “buy” call on MMC Corp on the back of actively pursing the listing of its port business, MMC Ports as well as better earnings delivery. 
“The current valuations of price-to-earnings ratio of 11 times for financial year 2020 forecast (FY20F) and price-to-book value of 0.3 times are attractive.
“We understand that the company is still actively pursuing the listing for MMC Ports but the timeline is less pressing given its efforts to restructure debt,” the research house noted. 
However, its target price of RM1.49 is higher than consensus despite assigning a 40% discount to our sum-of-the-parts (SOP) value. 
“We think this has priced in a holding company discount adequately and potential concerns over corporate governance issues,” AllianceDBS Research said. 
Meanwhile, it believes that MMC Corp should get better recognition as an infrastructure proxy, while the listing of its port business is something to look forward to. 
The market acknowledges the company’s position as a deep value conglomerate, while the pricing of its future assets through an initial public offering and better earnings delivery will be crucial to narrow the steep discount to SOP.
However, AllianceDBS Research noted the corporate governance and related party transactions pose the biggest risk for MMC given that Senai Airport Terminal Services Sdn Bhd purchase saw the share price tumbling in 2008. 
MALAYSIA AIRPORTS HOLDINGS BHDBy CIMB Research 
Rating: Add
Target price: RM9.47
CIMB Research is maintaining an “Add” recommendation on Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd  (MAHB) because investors are likely to accumulate for medium-term upside once the new operating agreement (OA) and upcoming regulatory changes are finalised from financial year 2020 onwards. 
Earlier this month, MAHB announced that the Malaysiaan cabinet approved the extension of MAHB’s concession to operate 39 airports in the country from 2034 to 2069. 
MAHB is expected to sign the new OA with the government by June. 
“We expect the user fee payments to the government to initially decline, and then no longer increase at a rate faster than revenue, as is the case currently. 
“Also, while four new geographical airport clusters have been established to facilitate the entry of new, third-party private investors and financiers of airport development capex, we believe MAHB will continue to have the ‘right of first refusal’ on any airport capital expenditure,” CIMB Research said. 
Moreover, MSCI would be increasing the weighting of China A shares into its indices progressively in May, Aug and November 2019 respectively, resulting in a potential reduction of Malaysia’s weighting. 
Given that MAHB is a member of certain MSCI indices, CIMB Research said its share price may see some periodic sell-offs from May until November 2019. 
“In our view, any sell-off is a good chance for investors to accumulate, as we expect MAHB to deliver strong earnings growth in FY20F due to upcoming regulatory changes, such as the regulatory asset base (RAB) framework,” it added. 
Meanwhile, the research house also noted that Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) would likely announce decisions on the inputs to the RAB model for aero tariff determination by June, begin a shadow period from July, finalise the inputs by October, and begin official implementation by Jan 1, 2020. 
However, MAHB is trying to convince Mavcom to give it more time to raise gearing levels, and to consider applying a higher WACC in the first cycle. 
In its October 2018 paper, Mavcom considered using a real WACC of 7% (nominal WACC of 10%), resulting in a 16% rise in aero tariffs based on RM4bil of airport capex over the first three-year RAB cycle. 
Moreover, Mavcom had proposed a price cap resulting in MAHB asking for an aero revenue floor to be in place, to protect it from black-swan events. 
“Eventual introduction of dual-till RAB to drive earnings further. The introduction of dual-till RAB is at the earliest from Jan 1, 2023 (the start of the second RAB cycle), or from the third RAB cycle beginning Jan 1, 2026 as we assume. 
“As the non-aero business wriggles free from regulatory constraints on ROIC, required aero tariffs should rise further, helping make MAHB’s Malaysia business even more profitable,” CIMB Research said.

JF Apex Securities is keeping a ‘Buy’ call with an unchanged target price of 0.63 based on financial year 2020 (FY20) earnings per share forecast and price-to-earnings ratio of 9 times.

Pantech’s FY19 net profit increased 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM47.6mil on the back of a 1% revenue decline to RM609.2mil.
JF Apex Securities said the FY19 earnings achieved 90% of its full-year forecast of RM52.6mil while revenue accounted for 94% of its expectation. 
The research house is maintaining its revenue and earnings per share forecasts for FY20 and FY21. 
Pantech’s financial results in the fourth quarter of 2019 (4Q19) net profit rose 1% to RM11.5mil amid lower revenue as quarterly revenue decreased 5% to RM142.6mil. 
In the quarter, its trading segment revenue rose 10% y-o-y to RM93.9mil while sales from the manufacturing division declined 25% to RM47.7mil. 
This was due to suspension of export of carbon steel butt welded fittings to the US following a 183% anti-dumping tax imposed on Pantech.
“The management is using legal means to contest the US Department of Commerce’s
decision to impose the anti-dumping tax. Pantech could enjoy a favourable outcome if the decision is reversed,” JF Apex said. 
BANKING SECTORBy AmBank Research
Rating: Overweight
AMBANK Research is maintaining an “overweight” recommendation on the banking sector with the top picks of Maybank, RHB Bank and BIMB Holdings . 
“External factors and the recent concerns on Malaysia dropping out of the global bond index have pushed valuations of large-cap banking stocks to new lows which are below those during the 2007 and 2008 financial crisis. 
“We see values emerging for the larger capitalised banking stocks of Maybank, CIMB and Public Bank,” the research house said. 
With the recent revival of the East Coast Rail Link and Bandar Malaysia projects, AmBank Research said the market risk premium would decline and improve investors’ sentiment. 
“On the wider market concerns of Malaysia dropping out of the global bond index, we believe that there is still room for further consolidation on the bond market as well as improvement in market accessibility and macro fundamentals before the next reviewby the FTSE Russell in September 2019,” it added. For the local banking sector, return-on-equity ratio is at 10.6%, which is near the average of Singapore and Thai banks. 
Moreover, AmBank Research said dividend yields of local banks are turning attractive compared with the regional countries aside from valuations.
“Dividend yields for banks in Malaysia on average are higher than that of Singapore, Indonesia and Thai banks at 4.5% and 4.8% for financial year 2019 (FY19) and FY20 respectively,” it added. 
Given the market expectations of a 25 basis points cut of the overnight policy rate (OPR) in the second half of this year, AmBank Research noted that the impact would be minimal on banks’ earnings of 1% to 3%, while net interest margins could be impacted by 2 to 4 basis points."

PetDag currently has 1,057 petrol stations nationwide.Managing director and CEO Datuk Seri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir said the group had substantial land bank and was now looking at how to operationalise it.“We’re looking at about 10 new stations. Last year, we did 12. The expansion would be at strategic locations where there are high-volume and high-density populations,” he told a press conference after PetDag’s annual general meeting here yesterday.Asked about the impact of the possible removal of the petrol price caps when the petrol subsidies for the low-income group is implemented, group chairman Datuk Arif Mahmood said it would be dependent on the disposable income and the lifestyle of the consumers.“We have to see what the crude oil price would be. Clearly, if you remove the cap and when the price is high, the pump price would go up. We’ll see what the new policies are, then only can we access the impact.“The ceiling price actually helps dealers, consumers and oil companies in terms of price stability. The feedback from our dealers is that it has helped manage their cash flows,” he said.Syed Zainal Abidin concurred, saying that it was still too early to determine the impact of the subsidy. “If it’s meant for the B40, and predominantly Petronas customers are in the B40 group, then I think we are in a good position because we are, by far, the biggest network in the country, but let’s not speculate and wait for the announcement,” he said, adding that Petronas’ net margin for the automatic pricing mechanism or APM has not been revised for the past eight to nine years, so the only way it can make profits is via its efficiency in managing inventory, such as buying low and selling high.On whether there are plans to axe non-performing stations, Arif said while rationalisation is part of the company’s strategy, it also looks into its entire network as a whole, how to optimise its logistics and also how to look after the interest of the people.“It’s not just about profits in Petronas. It’s profits and also the well-being of the people.“Shareholders’ requirement, company requirement, leaders and consumers are things that we look at to strike a balance to continue to give good returns to our shareholders,” he said.Moving forward for 2019, Md Ariff said PetDag would continue leveraging on digital and its network of partners to further enhance the seamless and frictionless customer experience for its customers.Setel, which is the first e-payment app of its kind that is integrated directly to the fuel pump, has done more than 100,000 transactions since it was launched at the end of November last year.The app has about 100,000 users now. The usage is available at around 100 Petronas stations in the Klang Valley. It will be rolled out to the entire Klang Valley by May.Md Ariff said there would be more partners coming on board and more features in the app, which would also be tied to the company’s non-fuel business.“The societal behaviour has changed. What convenience is to customers now is different from what it was back then. We’re trying to leverage not only on the physical but also the virtual space.“We’ve done an ethnography on the consumer pinpoints and we’ll be developing new products with new partners to increase our non-fuel income, and at the same time, complement the fuel income,” Md Ariff said, adding that they have set a high target for non-fuel contribution at 30%. The current rate is about 12%."

The additional palm oil purchase by China was part of the re-negotiation between Malaysia-China at at the conclusion of the revised East Coast Rail Link project.
According to industry observers, local palm oil exports to China are expected to jump by about 2.26 million tonnes in 2019 compared with 1.86 million tonnes recorded in 2018.
Under the signed MoU, an additional supply of a minimum of 1.9 million tonnes of palm oil to China over a five-year period, starting from 2019 with the volume estimated at RM4.56bil based on an average price of US$600 per tonne.
“This is a very interesting development as China imports of local palm oil has been on the downtrend in recent years.
“The average purchase price of US$600 per tonne CPO can be considered as a reasonably fair price considering the volatility in the current CPO prices,” said an industry source.
In 2018, China is Malaysia’s third largest palm oil export market at 1.86 million tonnes, after the EU at 1.91 million tonnes and India, the largest export market for Malaysia at 2.51 million tonnes.
Together with Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey and the US, the top seven markets accounted for 9.31 million tonnes or 56.5% of Malaysia’s total palm oil exports in 2018.
Malaysia’s annual palm oil export volume to China shrank to below three million tonnes after 2015.
The volume was at 3.76 million tonnes in 2011, which was more than Indonesia’s 2.04 million to China.
But since 2015, Indonesia has overtaken Malaysia in terms of export volume of palm oil to China, with the former’s exceeding three million tonnes, while Malaysia’s dropped to 2.44 million tonnes.
On whether China’s additional purchase of local palm oil will to ease the current high inventory situation, an analyst with a local bank-backed brokerage said “I don’t foresee this will help to reduce the bloating global palm oil stocks situation (Malaysia and Indonesia) nor will it help to boost CPO prices higher to trade above RM2,400 per tonne level.”
News of China increasing its palm oil purchases from Malaysia is also not reflected in the trading of CPO futures for June, which ended RM13 lower at RM2,157 per tonne yesterday.
According to the analyst, the current palm oil stocks is currently still too high.
Malaysia’s palm oil inventory alone stood at 2.92 million tonnes as at end-March, while Indonesia is estimated at about 5 million tonnes.
“While the China (purchasing) factor is positive for CPO prices, there will not be a dramatic jump in prices simply because the global palm oil stockpile situation,” he added.
Another potential market-moving factor is on the news that China will invest about RM2bil to set up a biofuel plant in Malaysia.
“This move will likely help to reduce Malaysia palm oil stock in the near future given the ample supply of raw material for the biofuel plant here.”"

It had seen a surge in share price by some 30% to 27 sen after opening at 20.5 sen with very strong volumes on Wednesday.
In its report yesterday, CGSCIMB said with the successful debt refinancing exercise, an equity issuance would no longer be necessary, but it noted that BAB still has “a long to-do” list.
The oil and gas company announced earlier this week that it had successfully restructured US$660mil of borrowings that are due almost immediately. They are made up of US$380mil of unsecured term loans and US$280mil of revolving credit facilities with a tranche (US$260mil) to be repaid over two years and another tranche (US$400mil) that will be repaid over five years. 
“We congratulate the BAB team for being tough negotiators, as we believe that all of the  banks involved would have wanted their money back. Ultimately they were forced to extend the repayment deadlines as BAB’s major shareholders resisted a rights issue,” said CGSCIMB, which upgraded the stock to “hold” from  “reduce” or “sell” and a target price of 29 sen.It said that the sum-of-parts valuation of 36 sen remained unchanged but it had factored in a discount of 20% to derive a new target price of 29 sen. 
“This discount is applied as interest costs will be much higher post refinancing and BAB continues to face heightened execution risks in terms of the asset monetisation exercise and uncertainty over whether the Armada Kraken can resolve its uptime issues permanently,” it said.
To repay the rest of the principal sum owed, BAB is looking to deploy “surplus funds from operations” and hoped to secure “new project financing” to repay the loans, CGSCIMB said.
“However, we are worried about the potential for continued uptime issues on the Armada Kraken to reduce contractual cashflows, and we remain sceptical as to the banks’ willingness to extend new project financing to BAB.” it said.
UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH), in another report, said that as the loans are to be refinanced to very long tenures, BAB has guided for an incremental interest expense of RM40mil in the financial year 2019 (FY19). 
“This also implies a full-year incremental interest expense of RM60mil from FY20 onwards. While we have adjusted our forecasts in tandem, we still require key guidance on detailed action on timeline and earnings plans to fulfill the conditions of the refinanced loans,” UOB Kay Hian said. 
“We are still concerned about the group’s long-term ability to repay the loans until it secures material contracts to replenish its subsea vessels,” it added.
UOB Kay Hian retained its “sell” call on BAB but raised its target price to 16 sen from nine sen."

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $65.21 a barrel, falling 68 cents, or 1.03 percent, after hitting a session high of $66.28.

NEW YORK: Brent crude hit US$75 per barrel on Thursday for the first time in nearly six months after quality concerns suspended some Russian crude exports to Europe while the United States prepared to tighten sanctions on Iran.

Poland and Germany suspended imports of Russian crude via the Druzhba pipeline, citing contamination. The pipeline can ship up to 1 million barrels per day, or 1 percent of global crude demand, and about 700,000 bpd of flow was suspended, according to trading sources and Reuters calculations.

Those hopes nose-dived Thursday when both banks said deal discussions failed, citing the costs and complexity of pulling off a merger.Deutsche Bank said a merger “would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the additional execution risks, restructuring costs and capital requirements.”The decision resolved one looming question around the merger but now raises others, especially what’s next for Deutsche Bank. Bank officials and investors have flagged that substantial changes to the bank’s structure, including a new round of cuts to its investment bank, raising more capital and shuttering of businesses, may be required.

The deal related to the Tartaruga Verde field and Module 3 of the Espadarte field.

The deal is part of Petrobras' divestment program, which seeks to reduce indebtedness. In its statement, the company also announced it had nearly completed the full sale of its TAG pipeline unit to France's Engie for $8.6 billion.

""Continuous portfolio management contributes to improving the allocation of capital, thereby increasing the generation of value for our shareholders, in addition to enabling the reduction of indebtedness and cost of the company's capital,"" the company's chief executive, Roberto Castello Branco, said in a statement.

Petrobras said that the total amount of asset divestments so far this year already amounts to $11.3 billion.

Petrobras said the value of the transaction with Petronas will be paid in two installments: $258.7 million on Thursday and $1.03 billion at the close of the transaction.

Petrobras will maintain a 50 percent stake and the operation of the fields, while Petronas will get a bigger toehold in oil production in Brazil, where it already operates in the lubricants segment.

The Tartaruga Verde field began operations on June 22 and currently produces about 103,000 barrels per day of oil and 1.2 million cubic meters per day of gas.

Module 3 is an area of the Espadarte field to be developed in an integrated way with the Tartaruga Verde and is expected to begin producing oil in 2021.

Petrobras also announced the assignment of its total participation in 34 onshore production fields to the company Potiguar E & P S.A., a subsidiary of Petrorecôncavo.

The total value of the transaction is $384.2 million to be paid in three installments.

Petrorecôncavo, which presented the second best offer of the tender process, was selected after the disqualification of the company 3R Petroleum. - Reuters"

The euro was off 1 percent for the week at $1.1133 as euro zone economic figures continued to disappoint.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.8 percent firmer for the week so far at 98.128 having touched its highest since May 2017.

The yen proved an outlier by gaining as speculators cut short positions ahead of holidays which will see most Japanese markets shut for six whole trading days.

The exceptionally long break has investors concerned there could be another ""flash crash"" like the one in early January that drove the yen massively higher in a matter of minutes.

The dollar was down at 111.51 yen, after shedding 0.5 percent overnight, but was buoyed elsewhere by solid data on U.S. capital goods orders.

The rise in the yen and some mixed Japanese economic data nudged the Nikkei down 0.7 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent.

The mood might lighten later on Thursday should data on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) prove as upbeat as some now expect.

A string of solid numbers has led analysts to revise up their forecasts for growth and the latest median polled by Reuters is for an annualised 2.0 percent.

The closely-watched estimate of GDP from the Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting an outcome of 2.7 percent, a huge turnaround from a few weeks ago when it was down at 0.5 percent.

Yet the rebound has not been mirrored in inflation which remains subdued across much of the developed world, prompting a host of central banks to turn dovish.

Just this week central banks in Sweden and Canada have backed off plans to tighten, while the Bank of Japan tried to dispel doubts about its accommodative stance by pledging to keep rates at super-low levels for at least one more year.

European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos on Thursday opened the door to more money-printing if needed to boost inflation in the euro zone.

Rate cuts look much likelier in Australia and New Zealand after recent disappointingly weak inflation reports.

The Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting next week and is expected to reaffirm its patient stance. A Reuters poll of analysts out Thursday found most believed the Fed was done with tightening altogether.

MIXED EARNINGS

Wall Street had ended Thursday mixed after a raft of earnings reports. The Dow fell 0.51 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.04 percent and the Nasdaq added 0.21 percent.

Amazon.com Inc shares firmed after the market closed as the company reported a first-quarter profit that topped estimates.

Shares of Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp both jumped after they reported better-than-expected results. Intel Corp fell sharply after the chip maker forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates.

In commodity markets, spot gold was idling at $1,278.26 per ounce.

Brent crude ran into profit-taking after hitting $75 per barrel on Thursday for the first time in nearly six months following the suspension of some Russian crude exports to Europe.

Brent crude futures lost 20 cents to $74.15 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 24 cents at $64.97 a barrel. - Reuters"

The research house said in a morning note that CIMB Niaga has seen relatively subdued income in 2019 given the recent conclusion of Indonesia's presidential elections which curtailed activity, coupled with competitive funding pressures caused a spike in interest expenses, which weighed on net interest income growth.

1QFY19 net profit benefited from lower provisions, which fell 16.2% year-on-year (y-o-y)

Operating income rose 1.1% y-o-y, driven mainly by non-interest income growth, which gained 4% y-o-y.

""Higher arranger and syndication fees (+241.9% YoY, +488.9% QoQ) is a major contributor, but a pace which is not expected to be sustainable however, though likely encouraging going forward,"" said PublicInvest.

According to the research house, Other financial highlights include:

Net interest margin (NIM) saw a 16bps uptick to 5.28% during the quarter, benefitting from a re-pricing of its asset base following last year’s cumulative 175bps rate hike.

Interest income is 4.8% higher y-o-y. Industry-wide deposit competition is causing a noticeable strain to funding costs however, reflected by the sharp 11.9% YoY jump in interest expense. 

Current account andsavings account (CASA) optimisation and digital-based propositions will be major lines of defense against margin erosions.

CASA ratio is a healthy 53.74% (4QFY18: 52.61%). Long-term NIMs is targeted to average about 5%.

Loans outstanding slipped 0.3% q-o-q,with activity curtailed by the recently-concluded Presidential and Legislative elections as mentioned earlier.

Y-o-y growth is an encouraging 5%, with the mortgage (+13.1% YoY) and corporate (+6.6% YoY) segments key drivers. 

With incumbent President Joko WIdodo likely to return as leader, and armed with fresh growth initiatives in tow, infrastructure-related lending may feature more prominently going forward.

Continued focus will also be on its Consumer and SME franchises, while the Group’s auto book is likely to start seeing expansions 3QFY19 onward following the successful rebalancing of its portfolio.

Asset quality risks are benign, with indicators continuing to show improvements. 

Gross impaired loan and gross non-performing loan ratios are 3.91% (4QFY18: 4.05%) and 3.04% (4QFY18: 3.11%). 

An uptick in special mention loans to 4.40% in 1QFY19 (4QFY18:3.98%) is mostly timing-related."

“The potential downside risks are deterioration in loan growth and asset quality. Our FY19-21F EPS forecasts and dividend discount model based target price of RM6.50 are intact,” it said.

“We are slightly more positive on RHB Bank following the briefing due to the positive results from its DB initiatives. 

“Holistic approach yielding various applications RHB Bank’s DB strategies are holistic, covering various areas like housing loans, SME loans, treasury, etc,” it said.

CIMB Research said these have helped the bank to develop various applications, such as (1) RHB MyHome App, (2) RHB ISmart sales tool, (3) SME Online Financing, and (4) RHB Insurance App. 

RHB Bank said its DB initiatives have yielded positive results. For instance, its RHB MyHome App has contributed a meaningful 17% of its total mortgage business of more than RM2bil year-to-date.

Furthermore, SME loans applied through its SME Online Financing have totalled more than RM80mil within less than one year of its launch in June 2018.

“By 2022, it aims for DB to account for (1) 80% of its banking transactions, and (2) 50% of its retail/SME businesses.  By then, it also expects 25% of its new business to be generated from analytics. 

“In our view, the development of DB will help RHB Bank (and most banks) to improve operating efficiency and customer experience. However, the impact on earnings would be depleted by the lowering (or even the waiver) of fee for certain online transaction,” said the research house."

The bleak results underscore the challenges of Nomura, which recently announced a restructuring plan that includes cutting $1 billion in costs from its wholesale business and shutting about 20 percent of its domestic retail branches.

Nomura posted a net loss of 100.4 billion yen ($897 million) for the year ended March, wider than an average estimate of 81.4 billion yen from seven analysts polled by Refinitiv.

In the fourth quarter, profits were almost wiped out for Japan's biggest investment bank and brokerage, sinking about 96 percent from a year earlier to 800 million yen.

""The result was very much disappointing,"" Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura told reporters at an earnings briefing.

""We are making an effort to get our business back at the cruising speed as soon as possible,"" Kitamura said.

As part of its cost-cutting plans, Nomura has already said it will shut more than 30 of its 156 retail branches at home. It also plans to axe about 100 jobs in London, the centre for its European investment banking business, Reuters has reported.

On Thursday, Nomura said it would not pay the performance-linked portion of compensation to dozens of executives for the year ended March given the lacklustre financial performance.

Pretax profit at Nomura's key retail unit plunged 85 percent year in the fourth quarter.

""Stock prices have recovered in some degree since January but our customers remain wait-and-see,"" Kitamura said.

But it is the wholesale business, which serves corporations and institutional investors, that has been the biggest drag for Nomura. The segment swung to a pretax loss of 13 billion yen in the fourth quarter, from a 44.2 billion yen profit a year ago.

The segment has been squeezed by lower trading revenue in fixed income. The sizeable loss speaks to the scale of the challenge ahead for Nomura and its CEO Koji Nagai.

But Nagai has no plan to follow the lead of Wall Street rivals and seek a tie-up with a commercial lender, he recently told Reuters, eschewing a model that has redefined investment banking since the global financial crisis.

While it lacks the lending firepower of a commercial bank, Nomura's independence means it is not confined by the banking relationships of other lenders and can do deals with anyone in Japan, Nagai has said. - Reuters"

Nestle Malaysia CEO Juan Aranols said an estimated RM100mil will be for the expansion of the Chembong factory in Negri Sembilan to establish the world’s largest MILO Manufacturing Centre of Excellence.
The expansion works is expected to be completed this September.
The remaining capex will be utilised for product innovation, improvement of facilities as well as sustainability efforts.
“Our increased capex plans will further support our focus on leveraging new opportunities for our products, delivering a steady stream of innovations and constantly driving efficiencies that will help us sustain our competitive edge and accelerate growth,” said Aranols at a press briefing held in conjunction with Nestle Malaysia’s annual general meeting yesterday.
Despite the volatile consumer climate, Aranols is confident that demand for Nestle brands would remain.
Innovation is a key growth engine for the group, contributing 10% to sales last year.
Over the next two to four years, innovation is expected to contribute some 15% to total group sales.
Year-to-date, Nestle Malaysia has launched Maggi Pedas Giler 2X and Just Milk strawberry flavoured milk, with more product launches to come over the next few months.
Going forward, the group is likely to face headwinds from the increasing cost of raw materials.
However, there will be minimal impact to Nestle Malaysia’s margins, as the group has implemented internal savings measures and hedging policies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material prices.
“Product price increase is a sensitive issue and we will only consider this after we have exhausted all other possibilities.
“In the event that a price increase is unavoidable, we will ensure that it does not affect the main products consumed by the Bottom 40 (B40) segment.
“The sugar tax is also immaterial to Nestle Malaysia, given that very few of our products are taxable,” Aranols elaborated.
Currently, e-commerce contributes less than 5% to Nestle Malaysia’s sales, though this figure is growing fast.
The group intends to continue engaging with its customers on digital platforms, which has provided relevant insights for product improvements and innovations.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/26/ecrl-boost-for-westports/,ECRL boost for Westports,Corporate News,"Friday, 26 Apr 2019",,"PETALING JAYA: Westports Holdings Bhd  is poised to be one of the beneficiaries of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) once it is built and ready.
Westports group managing director Datuk Ruben Emir Gnanalingam said that the increased connectivity would help support demand for cargo at its port.
“The added rail connectivity would see more industries being set up along the route, especially along the key stations or stops on the route,” Ruben told StarBiz. 
“I don’t think we will benefit much from the construction of the ECRL, but we will benefit from the flourishing of industries and factories along the rail route that will help add to port cargo,” he added.
The ECRL route will connect Port Klang on the Straits of Malacca to Kota Baru in the north-east of Peninsular Malaysia.
The revised alignment will cover Kota Baru-Mentakab-Jelebu-Kuala Kelawang-Bangi/Putrajaya-Port Klang.
Meanwhile, commenting on its capacity, Ruben said that it is expecting capacity to grow by about 3%-8% this year from 9.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) last year.
“We have the capacity for up to 14 million TEUs in the port. We are anticipating that cargo traffic would continue to be driven by transshipment demand in the South-East Asian region,” he said.
Commenting on its capital expenditure (capex), Ruben said that capex requirements this year were quite small and the company had more than enough container capacity at the moment. 
“Usually, we would spend about RM50mil-RM100mil on maintenance capex,” he said. 
The company in a statement yesterday said its total container throughput improved to 9.5 million TEUs in financial year 2018 ended Dec 31 (FY18). 
“Gateway containers increased by 18% to 3.3 million TEUs, as our container terminal supported and reflected favourable domestic economic activities, while transshipment volume registered a slight increase to 6.2 million TEUs,” it said.
Westports also said that it had invested RM2.5bil in recent years to purchase state-of-the-art terminal operating equipment.
It had also invested to construct a contiguous linear berth with a deep draft that would enable its terminal to support clients’ plans of deploying even larger vessels.
“In FY18, Westports accommodated 6,966 container vessels, and the company is berthing more and new ultra-large container vessels. The OOCL United Kingdom, which is the world’s largest container vessel, made its maiden call at Westports in FY18,” it said.
Westports said its intra-Asia container volume grew by 14% to 5.9 million TEUs and this underpinned Westports’ overall throughput growth for FY18.
Moving forward, Ruben said in the statement that the company last year saw favourable volume recovery after having transitioned successfully towards servicing container liners under their current global alliances. 
He said that the company would achieve higher overall container throughput in 2019, with growth coming from both gateway and transshipment containers. 
“Westports is also finalising the planning details for the multi-billion proposed container terminal expansion, which would strengthen the company and Port Klang’s role as the pre-eminent port for the nation’s gateway trade,” Ruben said. 
“The expansion would also reinforce the terminal as one of the key transshipment hubs in the South-East Asian region for international container shipping alliances,” he added.
In FY18, Westports recorded a total revenue of RM1.61bil compared to RM2.09bil in FY17.
Container operations remained the main revenue contributor, as it attained a turnover of RM1.3bil, the company said.
Explaining this drop, Ruben said that there was a change in accounting standards as to how revenue was recognised, which explains the drop in revenue from FY18 from FY17.
Its statement said that despite the higher depreciation charges due to the recently completed container terminal facilities and higher manpower costs for additional staffing requirements, the company attained a record-level pre-tax profit of RM701mil, while it posted a net profit of RM533mil in FY18.
“Actually, we did make more money in FY18. There was also a drop in net profit for us last year (from RM651.51mil in FY17) because the effective tax rate in FY17 was lower after an investment tax allowance from the government,” he said."

The results make it harder for Nokia to meet its 2019 earnings targets and the Finnish vendor said it was now under “significant pressure on execution in the second half.”
The loss contrasts with a strengthening performance by Swedish rival Ericsson AB, which last week published stronger than expected results while warning that it is taking contracts on less lucrative terms to secure longer-term work. 
Nokia’s shares have gained 2.6% this year, underperforming Ericsson which is up 22%.
Both Nordic vendors are trying to capitalise on the woes of their Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co, which faces headwinds in several countries over concerns that its equipment could be used for state-sponsored espionage. 
Britain is expected to become the latest Western country to announce measures that could make it tougher for Huawei to do business.
The benefits for its two main rivals could take years to emerge, however, as all three jostle for vital early contracts on 5G that will help them to lock in longer-term revenue.
“The first quarter was really weak, but still it’s the same story that at the end of the year it will take off at a steeper slope, driven by 5G deliveries,” said Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at Inderes. “This is testing for nerves.”
Nokia had already said spending on 5G networks would be skewed toward the second half of this year. 
Chief executive officer Rajeev Suri said yesterday that competitors were being more “commercially aggressive” in the early stages of the rollout.
This was happening, he said, as “some customers reassess their vendors in light of security concerns, creating near-term pressure but longer-term opportunity.
Nokia reported an adjusted operating loss of of 59 million euros (US$66mil), compared with an average profit estimate of 282.7 million euros in a Bloomberg survey. It repeated its forecast for earnings per share of between 25 and 29 euro cents this year and slightly positive recurring free cash slow.
It said that it was unable to recognise approximately 200 million euros of net sales related to 5G deliveries in the first quarter, mainly in North America, “which we expect to recognise in full before the end of 2019.” — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/26/traders-puzzled--over-bojs-etflending-plan/,Traders puzzled  over BoJ’s ETF-lending plan,Business News,"Friday, 26 Apr 2019",,"TOKYO: The Bank of Japan (BoJ) says it may introduce a lending facility for its exchange-traded fund (ETF) buying programme, which would allow it to temporarily lend ETFs to market participants.
The nebulous one-sentence line on the last page of its latest statement on monetary policy left some traders puzzled, while others speculated on whether this could be a way to allay concerns surrounding liquidity.
“The BoJ’s share in the ETF market has been considerably increasing, so the BoJ would want to show the central bank is dealing with it somehow with this ETF lending facility,” said, Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management Japan Ltd in Tokyo. 
“With this step, the BoJ would be appealing that it would provide liquidity to the market.”
Assuming Shigemi’s analysis holds – and governor Haruhiko Kuroda may shed more light at a press briefing later that the move would mark another attempt to make the BoJ’s stimulus programmes more sustainable.
The central bank has previously scaled back its government-bond purchases, and widened its tolerance band for 10-year yields, in an effort to address declining trading volumes.
Not everyone is as positive on the BoJ’s move.
“Sounds like a ‘grand old Duke of York’ move to me: buying ETFs to lift the market then lend ETFs to short sellers to march it down again,” said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA Ltd. 
“Unfortunately, there is pretty clear evidence that their ETF buying is merely serving to damage the price discovery machinery of the market, driving away investors, particularly foreign ones. I’m sure they have the best of intentions, but they’re hemlock to the market, as they were to the bond market.”
With the BoJ’s ETF holdings totaling 29 trillion yen (US$259bil) as of September at market value, the central bank owns 77% of the nation’s ETF market. 
Analysts have called on the BoJ to adjust its ETF purchase programme by increasing assets linked to the broader Topix index, and shifting away from those linked to the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, to help ease distortions in Nikkei 225 stocks such as Fast Retailing Co that are heavily weighted in the blue-chip gauge.
The BoJ has changed the allocation of its ETF buying twice since it began the programme in 2010. 
In July, its purchases of Topix-linked funds increased, while the weighting for the Nikkei 225 fell. 
Last year, the central bank bought a record 6.5 trillion yen of ETFs tracking the nation’s shares, topping its annual target of about six trillion yen.
“Maybe they are doing it to help improve liquidity of Nikkei 225 stocks,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Pte in Singapore. 
“That’s the only thing I can think of. But lending ETFs out would suggest that there are borrowers who want to short the index, maybe. I really don’t know.” — Bloomberg"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/26/uk-regulator-blocks-sainsburys-us94bil-asda-takeover/,UK regulator blocks Sainsbury’s US$9.4bil Asda takeover,Business News,"Friday, 26 Apr 2019",,"LONDON: Britain’s competition regulator yesterday blocked Sainsbury’s proposed £7.3bil (US$9.4bil) takeover of Walmart owned Asda - a huge blow to the supermarket groups who wanted to combine to overtake market leader Tesco.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruling is also a major setback for Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe, the architect of the deal and the group’s boss since 2014.
Coupe made unwanted headlines when he was caught on camera singing: “We’re in the money” shortly after the deal was announced last April. Analysts said questions will be raised over his future after it failed to win approval.
The deal would have resulted in a substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level, with prices rising in stores, online and at petrol stations, the CMA said.
Coupe took issue with the CMA’s analysis.
“The specific reason for wanting to merge was to lower prices for customers,” he said in a statement.
“The CMA’s conclusion that we would increase prices post-merger ignores the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market. The CMA is today effectively taking £1bil out of customers’ pockets.”
Sainsbury’s, Walmart and Asda said they had mutually agreed to terminate the transaction, opting not to challenge the CMA’s ruling through the courts.
As well as leapfrogging Tesco, the deal would have given Walmart a way to exit Britain, one of the weakest performers in its global portfolio.
Shares in Sainsbury’s were down 5.1% at 0820 GMT, extending their losses over the last three months to 23%.
After delivering a damning provisional report in February, the CMA’s final report was equally stern, finding that UK shoppers and motorists would be worse off if Sainsbury’s and Asda combined.
“We have concluded that there is no effective way of addressing our concerns, other than to block the merger,” said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA inquiry group.
Sainsbury’s share of the UK grocery market has dropped from 15.8% to 15.3% in the last year, while Asda’s has fallen from 15.6% to 15.3%, according to data from market researcher Kantar.
All of the big four grocers have lost share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which now have a combined 13.6% share. Tesco has 27.4%.
Sainsbury’s and Asda have argued that their share of the total market for food was smaller than the data indicated because of the emergence of new players like delivery services, but the regulator was not persuaded.
Coupe said he was confident in Sainsbury’s strategy, which focuses on own-brand products, and on the quality, provenance and ethical credentials of its food.
Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, said she was disappointed by the CMA’s ruling.
“Our focus now is continuing to position Asda as a strong UK retailer delivering for customers. Walmart will ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that,” she said.
The implications of the deal failing are likely to be significant. Some analysts believe Sainsbury’s will have to undergo a major shake-up that could see new chairman Martin Scicluna part company with Coupe.
Analysts at Jefferies believe the risk of a reinvigorated market leader Tesco continuing to recover customers historically lost to Sainsbury’s needs addressing with urgency.
Earlier this month Sainsbury’s lost its status as Britain’s No. 2 supermarket group by market share to Asda, according to Kantar data. Tesco in contrast is gaining momentum, reporting a 34 percent jump in full-year operating profit on April 10. — Reuters"

A surprise drop in German business morale has highlighted the divergence between economic data in the United States and the eurozone.
The European Central Bank in March pushed out the timing of its first post-crisis rate hike until 2020 and its policymakers are still expressing worries about economic growth.
That is impacting the euro which yesterday suffered its worst day in over six weeks, falling 0.6% to a 22-month low of US$1.1141.
It traded flat yesterday at US$1.1154.
“Political uncertainties combined with economic concerns are a rather bad cocktail for the euro. In particular if the economy on the other side of the Atlantic is humming,” Antje Praefcke, an analyst at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients.
Praefcke said a polarised election in Spain on Sunday could further dampen the euro’s prospects.
The vote is being fought on emotive issues including gender equality and national unity following Catalonia’s failed 2017 independence bid.
Sweden’s Riksbank is likely to keep its benchmark rate unchanged and may be forced to delay plans to tighten policy later in 2019, a Reuters poll of analysts published on Tuesday showed.
The Swedish crown was down 0.2% at 9.4190 crowns, a six-week low, ahead of the decision today.
“The Riksbank may push further out the timing of the next rate hike, and also the market may speculate it’s too early for a rate cut by the Turkish central bank,” said Mizuho’s Yamamoto. “That could be a negative for these currencies and positive for the dollar.”
The greenback rallied to a 23-month high of 98.189 against a basket of key rivals overnight while gaining more than half a per cent, largely propelled by the euro’s weakness. The index last traded 0.15% lower at 98.027.

“It looks like we will reach volume production at the end of this year with at least more than 1,000 cars a week, maybe 2,000,” Musk said on an earnings conference call on Wednesday. “If it’s not then, it will be shortly thereafter.”
Musk was responding to an analyst’s question about whether he was still confident in reaching a 3,000-car-a-week target. In January, Tesla’s chief executive officer said he was initially aiming for output of 3,000 Model 3 cars a week in Shanghai, though he didn’t specify when that target would be reached. Tesla’s first Chinese factory, which is under construction, will help the company to avoid the current 15% tariff on imported cars from the US, making its pricing more competitive against local brands.
The need for Tesla to expand beyond its home market of the United States was highlighted by the earnings it reported Wednesday, with first-quarter results missing analysts’ projections. The halving of a federal tax incentive for Tesla purchases starting in January dragged on US demand in the quarter, and Tesla struggled to offset that drop by starting deliveries of the Model 3 in Europe and China.
China has been supporting the construction of Tesla’s Shanghai factory, with the company securing up to US$521mil in China bank loans to finance the plant. A Shanghai government official said in March that he expected the factory’s assembly shop to complete construction in May.
“We have 99% of things in good shape,” Musk said. “But if 1% is missing you still can’t make a car.”
Musk also said Tesla is working to have multiple battery-cell suppliers for the Shanghai factory. Tesla, which has thus far relied on Panasonic Corp. batteries, is in talks with top Chinese battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd about supplying cells for the Model 3 cars it will assemble in Shanghai, people familiar with the matter have said.

Now its top executives are sharing the pain.
In a first for Japan’s largest securities firm, all senior managers will forgo bonuses, Nomura said when reporting quarterly earnings yesterday. The hit to the executives’ paychecks came as fourth-quarter profit plummeted 96% from a year earlier.
Even as competitors UBS Group AG, Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG managed to deliver some positive earnings surprises, most of Nomura’s businesses slumped in the quarter, including the domestic retail brokerage. 
The string of bad news over the past few months has been enough to raise questions about whether the 94-year-old firm might be acquired, a notion chief executive officer Koji Nagai has sought to debunk.
Nomura’s global markets revenue plunged 37% in the quarter from a year earlier, a steeper trading drop than at all its main US and European rivals that have reported so far.
Nagai this month announced a three-year cost cutting plan aimed at returning Nomura’s overseas operations to profit and revamping its mainstay domestic consumer business. Analysts are now looking for more clues on how the firm will boost revenue after cutting more than 100 trading jobs overseas.
“It may take time but we think they can recover a certain level of profitability in the years down the road,’’ Hideyasu Ban, senior research analyst at CLSA Ltd in Tokyo, said on Bloomberg Television before the earnings announcement.
Nomura’s retail segment posted an 85% drop in pre-tax income last quarter from a year earlier as individual investor sentiment remained weak despite a modest stock market rebound in Japan. That division had until now been a bulwark that in part shielded the firm from persistent losses overseas.
The wholesale division – which includes global markets and investment banking – posted a pre-tax loss partly because of a one-time charge related to a revision of a business portfolio. Fixed income and equities revenue fell from a year earlier. Overseas operations lost money for a fifth straight quarter.
The Japanese firm’s revival strategy centres on cutting US$1bil of annual expenses from its wholesale business by March 2022. Nagai also intends to trim retail business costs by around 30 billion yen over the same period partly by reducing branches in Japan.

Gross domestic product (GDP) data released in early Asian trading hours showed that South Korea’s economy suffered its worst quarter since the global financial crisis, as investments and exports slumped in response to Sino-US trade tensions and cooling Chinese demand. 
The won lost as much as 0.9%, weakening to 1.161.4 per dollar, making it the worst performer in the region on the day. 
“The break in the dollar index above the 98 level which is closely watched by the market on a technical basis and with the South Korean GDP being much weaker than expected, it has created an environment where markets are selling down Asian currencies,” Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Banking Group (Singapore) said. 
The dollar index which measures the greenback versus a basket of six major peers, rose to as high as 98.189 overnight, its highest level since May 2017, largely propelled by upbeat US economic data and the euro’s weakness. 
Among other Asian currencies, the Indonesian rupiah weakened for a second session, declining 0.4% to 14,150 per dollar. 
Bank Indonesia is due to release its monthly monetary policy decision later in the day, with a Reuters poll expecting them to stand pat. 
China’s yuan weakened as much as 0.2% against the dollar on the day, hitting its lowest level since March 29.

That’s because rising inventories and a smaller-than-expected trade gap were among the main forces pushing up gross domestic product estimates for the first three months of 2019.
Thanks partly to those two volatile components, a Commerce Department report Friday is expected to show GDP expanded at a 2.2% annualised pace in the period – matching the fourth quarter and about in line with the 10-year average – rather than the 1.5% seen in early March, according to Bloomberg’s surveys of economists.
“It’s a good news, bad news story,” said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. 
“If inventories are a big driver of growth in one quarter, then that sets you up for slower growth in subsequent quarters.”
Growth also likely got a lift from consumer spending -- the largest part of the economy -- after retail sales surged last month by the most since 2017. That eased some concern but expectations remain that consumers will pull back this year despite sustained wage gains and a tight labor market.
The more positive outlook is a shift in expectations from as recently as a week ago, when analysts saw several factors denting GDP, including the government shutdown that spanned most of January, extreme weather, and a trade war with China.
The more upbeat news has coincided with US stocks rising to a record this week and the Treasury yield curve moving away from an inversion that had signaled greater recession risk. 
While a brighter outlook would reduce arguments for a rate cut, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will keep borrowing costs unchanged this year amid subdued inflation -- plus, an unwinding of the inventories buildup is likely to drag down growth later in 2019.
“While first-quarter GDP is likely to show a significant deceleration from last year’s pace, a second-quarter rebound will be stifled by a significant inventory reduction, thereby extending an impression of lukewarm economic growth through midyear. 
“Bloomberg Economics projects first-quarter GDP growth below 2%, with inventory accumulation essentially mirroring the fourth quarter,” said economists Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva.
Fed officials at their policy meeting next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterisation of the economy to reflect the firmer data. 
The central bank won’t release quarterly projections until the next gathering in June.
Other headwinds remain, including residential and corporate spending that’s weakened after an initial tax cut-fuelled boost in 2018. That helps explain why analysts are still skeptical that the US expansion – though on the verge of becoming the nation’s longest on record in July – will still come short of President Donald Trump’s goal of a sustained 3% pace.
On the downside, factory production fell in the first quarter and business-equipment orders showed signs of cooling amid a dimming global growth outlook and trade-war uncertainty.
In addition, the Fed’s preferred price gauge, excluding food and energy, probably rose at a slower pace in the first quarter than the prior period, keeping inflation below its 2% objective.
“Though growth now looks a fair bit better than it did a month or two ago, it doesn’t necessarily mean the Fed is going to pivot back because they still want to see inflation,” said Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
“The Fed will welcome the better growth, but I don’t think it’s going to really change much for them in the near future.”

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/sk-hynix-forecasts-recovery-after-sharp-fall-in-profit/,SK Hynix forecasts recovery after sharp fall in profit,Corporate News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",11:27 AM MYT,"SEOUL: SK Hynix Inc., a supplier to Apple Inc., posted a steep decline in operating profit but forecast a recovery in demand this quarter for memory chips used in smartphones and data centres.

Operating income in the first quarter fell 69 percent to 1.37 trillion won ($1.2 billion), compared with the 1.5 trillion won expected by analysts. Still, the Icheon, South Korea-based company said DRAM demand is rebounding in the current quarter and the improvements should continue in the second half of the year. Shares rose as much as 3.8 percent.

Hynix’s forecast is a sign that data-centres customers are working through high inventories of memory chips, while lower prices have sparked demand from smartphone makers and other customers. The company said investments in servers should recover later this year.

“Server demand growth will increase significantly in the third quarter after rising slightly in the second quarter,” Sean Kim, vice president and head of DRAM marketing, said in a conference call. “We’re seeing clear signs.” 

Hynix’s comments add evidence that the memory industry has reached a low point and that prices are likely to improve in the second half of 2019. 

Apple cut its sales forecast earlier this year and Texas Instruments Inc. cautioned this week that a rebound in customer demand for its chips may take time to materialize. In early April, Samsung Electronics Co. reported preliminary earnings that dropped the most in more than four years. 

Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell 38 percent in the March quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc, while prices for 128 gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips dropped 23 percent.

“The slowdown in the expansion of data centers is temporary.” Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at Ebest Investment and Securities Co., said in an April 15 report. “The decline in memory prices will propel growth in demand.”

Apple is Hynix’s largest customer, providing about 13 percent of its sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Intel Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. also receive supplies from Hynix.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/activist-hedge-fund-urges-singapore-reit-merger-to-boost-value/,Activist hedge fund urges Singapore REIT merger to boost value,Corporate News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",11:32 AM MYT,"INGAPORE: Two Singapore REITs are being urged to join the wave of consolidation starting to sweep the industry.

Ascendas Hospitality Trust and Ascott Residence Trust should join forces to boost shareholder value and avoid potential conflicts following a separate deal in January that will see CapitaLand Ltd. gain ownership of the managers of both REITs, according to Quarz Capital Management Ltd.

As part that transaction, CapitaLand will hold 45 percent of Ascott units and about 28 percent of Ascendas Hospitality. The firms’ overlapping investment mandates could lead to corporate governance concerns, particularly when it comes to acquisitions, Quarz said in a letter to the board of Ascendas Hospitality and obtained by Bloomberg News.

“Despite its prime asset base, Ascendas Hospitality trades at about a 10 percent discount to its net asset value,” Quarz said in the letter. “We believe the continued undervaluation is due to its sub-optimal size.”

Spokespeople for Ascendas Hospitality, Ascott Residence and CapitaLand didn’t immediately respond to queries seeking comment on the letter.

The push for a deal comes as other Singapore REITs join forces. Earlier this month, OUE Commercial REIT agreed to buy OUE Hospitality Trust to create one of Singapore’s 10 biggest REITs, giving the combined entity greater firepower to make acquisitions. 

Last year, ESR-REIT and Viva Industrial Trust merged to create a larger logistics trust, and in January, developer CapitaLand struck a S$6 billion ($4.4 billion) deal to buy Temasek Holdings Pte units Ascendas Pte and Singbridge Pte.

A merger between Ascendas Hospitality and Ascott would create a firm with a market value of more than S$3.6 billion, and total assets of S$7.2 billion, making it the eighth-largest REIT in the city-state, Quarz said. 

That would qualify for inclusion in global benchmark indexes, potentially boosting trading volumes and the share price, the fund said.

The recommendations would result in Ascendas Hospitality generating a potential return of more than 40 percent in capital appreciation and dividends in the mid to long-term, Quarz said.

Ascendas Hospitality shares were steady 90.5 Singapore cents in early trade, having gained 18 percent this year, beating the benchmark Straits Times Index’s 9.3 percent rally. Ascott is up 10 percent this year.

The enlarged trust would also have increased financial flexibility to make larger acquisitions and “establish itself as market leader in new and lucrative hospitality formats,” Quarz said. Ascendas Hospitality owns hotels in Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul and Sydney, while Ascott has a portfolio of hotels targeting business travelers.

Quarz first started buying into Ascendas about a year ago and has discussed the merger proposal with some of its other institutional investors, Chief Investment Officer Jan Moermann said. He declined to disclose Quarz’s stake, but said the fund had support from about 10 percent of the shareholder base.

CapitaLand has said it’s reviewing all options for the two trusts after gaining control of their management arms in the Temasek deal. At a shareholder meeting earlier this month to seek approval for the acquisition, a shareholder flagged the potential overlap from the enlarged portfolio.

“There are various possibilities to resolve the conflict,” CapitaLand Chief Executive Officer Lee Chee Koon told the meeting, according to the Business Times newspaper. 

“One is we go to shareholders to ask for a narrower mandate for each REIT. The second possibility is to sell one of them. The third is to merge the two. All this, we need to review,” he said.- Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/how-chinas-us$13-trillion-bond-market-may-be-trade-war-winner/,How China's US$13 trillion bond market may be trade war winner,Forex,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",11:56 AM MYT,"HONG KONG: One of the less obvious beneficiaries of a resolution from the U.S.-China trade war is shaping up to be the US$13 trillion Chinese bond market.

China has already been welcoming record inflows into its local-currency debt after making it easier for foreign investors to access domestic securities and winning inclusion in a key global bond index. 

Now another hurdle is set to fall, should bilateral trade negotiations in coming weeks cement the deal that officials say is taking shape.

An agreement could help solidify expectations for a stable yuan exchange rate, removing any incentive China might ever have had to use it as a retaliatory tool; such concerns hurt the currency last year. 

It would also clear away the concerns of some investors about diversifying into Chinese debt amid a charged geopolitical environment.

“Evidence from conversations with clients suggests that any trade deal can only be positive for Chinese bond inflows,” said Teresa Kong, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager at Matthews Asia. 

“Several major pension funds have been reluctant to pull the trigger, as their boards consist of union representatives and CIOs are reluctant to make the case for investment in China bonds as they view it a politically risky proposition.”

Investor Angst

CIOs -- chief investment officers -- as a rule tend not to speak on the record about political concerns with regard to China, but those worries have been apparent nonetheless. 

Monthly inflows to Chinese bonds topped out late last year, China’s sovereign dollar-bond offering in October saw diminished American demand and the the biggest Chinese bank surprised market participants by canceling a dollar-security sale in November.

Another dynamic has been the yuan -- when it was appreciating or largely stable, as in 2017 and early 2018, inflows climbed. 

The exchange rate itself has become part of the trade talks, amid U.S. concerns over China’s potential depreciation, and that’s raised expectations for a clause to be included in the final agreement. 

While Chinese officials have been wary of any currency commitment, expectations of yuan stability have grown as negotiations progressed.

Yuan Factor
“The immediate reaction to a favorable trade deal will likely mean renminbi appreciation, and that might mean investors will be willing to add the weighting to China earlier,” said Stephen Chang, executive vice president and portfolio manager for Asia at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Hong Kong. Renminbi is the yuan’s official name. “It’s just a huge market you cannot ignore.”

Chang was referring to the weighting of Chinese bonds in global indexes. Bloomberg Barclays started including some domestic Chinese debt in its Global Aggregate index in April. Other index providers are reviewing a similar move. (Bloomberg LP owns Bloomberg Barclays and Bloomberg News.)

For many, there are still other hurdles to entering a bond market that’s on track to overtake Japan as the world’s second biggest this year, beyond U.S.-China ties. 

Trading liquidity is low relative to other markets, and hedging tools are scarcer. And while China’s interest in steady inflows is clear -- they would help offset pressure on the yuan as the nation’s current account surplus shrinks or even tips to deficit -- its commitment to the kind of transparency standards seen elsewhere remains a question.

Keeping Control

“If the authorities wanted to align the bond market more with the global system via serious and market-oriented reform, it could, but it would lose much in the way of control and capacity to influence,” said George Magnus, an economist at Oxford University’s China Center and author of “Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy.” 

Magnus said “the risk of things going wrong will keep the government very cautious.”

Even so, index inclusion alone will likely drive foreign inflows of up to $135 billion into China’s bond market over the next 20 months, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Onshore debt is also looking more appealing to foreigners due to its higher yields -- the premium of China’s 10-year rates over U.S. Treasuries hit the widest in a year this week.

Foreigners have been buying bonds in smaller scales compared with last year -- a trade deal could help overcome such hesitation.

“A successful conclusion of the negotiations would remove an important downside risk to the currency, which would make it easier for foreign investors to take local currency exposure,” said Michael Spencer, Asia Pacific chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Hong Kong.- Bloomberg"

HBA vice president Datuk Goh Seng Toh said measures need to be put in place to prevent developers from hiking up property prices. 

“Some developers have a 'teh-tarik' syndrome, where if steel prices increase 10%, house prices go up 10%,” he said at a panel discussion at the launch of Khazanah Research Institute’s (KRI) “Rethinking Housing: Between State, Market and Society” report today. 

“However, a house comprises of various materials. But in the housing arena, we have allowed the developers to call the shots!”

Goh said that there were price control mechanisms in place for essential items such as sugar and oil. 

“You can cut down your consumption on oil and sugar, but you can’t reduce shelter over your head,” he said. 

“A price control mechanism is not totally impossible if you’re serious enough.”

KRI chairman Dr Nungsari Ahmad Radhi however feels that a house pricing mechanism would not be feasible. 

“If you impose this on the developer, they will set a floor price and will not sell anything below this price. This will distort supply,” he said. 

Rehda President Datuk Soam Heng Choon meanwhile said everyone needs to play a role when it comes to solving the country’s housing affordability issues. 

“Everyone must play a role - the government, developers, contractors and even the discipline of the house buyers. 

“Everyone feels that it is the developers who are always at fault and only trying to maximise profits.”

According to KRI’s report, housing affordability in the country has not improved significantly between 2002 and 2016, partly stemming from the unresponsiveness of housing supply to effective demand. 

“A comprehensive housing agenda needs to move towards guiding and managing the housing sector as a whole, recognising housing as a basic need and a base for asset accumulation,” it said."

The rating agency said on Thursday the index measures the percentage of high-yield companies in EMs with the weakest speculative grade liquidity score of SGL-4, as a proportion of EM high-yield corporate family ratings.

Laura Acres, a Moody’s managing director, said the inaugural global EM LSI score was weak at 20.3% and above the long-term average of 18.9%, with the long-term average based on LSI scores between January 2017 and March 2019.

“Nevertheless, the score has fallen for three consecutive months; representing a slight improvement in liquidity across EMs globally.

“The score of 20.3% balances the weak liquidity seen in the EM Asia Pacific LSI of 39.1%, with the stronger liquidity in the EM Emerging Europe LSI of 2.9% and EM Latin America LSI at 8.5%,” Acres added.

A Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer Annalisa Di Chiara pointed out the EM Asia Pacific LSI had consistently been the weakest sub-indicator “and as the largest component of the EM LSI, it dictates trends for the indicator”.

“Despite the slight improvement in the EM Asia Pacific LSI to 39.1% in March 2019 from 40.6% at December 2018, the global EM LSI remains elevated at 20.3%,” Di Chiara said.

Moody’s points out that the improvement in 2019 reflects a high level of debt issuance in China.

Proceeds from Q1 issuance were largely used to refinance existing debt, improving liquidity scores in Asia Pacific.

The global EM LSI included 311 companies from 39 countries at March 31, 2019. 

The indicator for Asia Pacific is the largest with 133 companies, followed by Latin America with 94 companies, Emerging Europe with 69, and Africa and the Middle East with 15.

The EM LSI is part of Moody’s comprehensive and focused research on EM which kicked off last year with the publication of the EM Chartbook. 

EMs are increasingly forming a larger part of the investment space and Moody's has endeavored to provide investors with comparative ratings data across key EM regions and groupings such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), and Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS), as well as across key industries."

Chief executive officer Juan Aranols said RM100 million is allocated to upgrade the Milo capacity at its Chembong factory in Negeri Sembilan.

Meanwhile, the remaining RM120 million is for other factories' capacity upgrading.

Last year, it allocated RM147 million for capex. The highest allocation in the last five years was RM362 million in 2014.

Aranols said Nestle has seven factories in Malaysia, with the Chembong plant currently producing Milo, Kitkat and ice cream products.  

The upgraded Milo production will be fully operational in September, and is set to further reinforce Nestle's position in the segment.

Speaking to reporters after its 35th annual general meeting today, he expressed confidence that demand for Nestle products will remain healthy despite the current volatility in consumer markets by championing innovations, the nutrient segment, emerging channels and in-store execution.

Aranols said product innovations contributed 10 per cent to its sales in 2018, and are expected to increase to 15 per cent over the next two to four years.  He said Nestle, with an overall 15.7 per cent market share, is the number one player in Malaysia's food and beverages space.

In 2018, the group recorded revenue of RM5.5 billion, up 4.9 per cent from 2017, driven by the domestic and export business.

Its net profit for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) jumped to RM658.88 million from RM642.55 million the preceding year.

""Our proactive cost management and improved internal efficiencies, in the context of favourable commodity prices, further contributed to our profitability in 2018 and will offset tensions in commodity markets in 2019,” he said.

Group managing director Datuk Ruben Emir Gnanalingam said on Thursday Westports was also finalising the planning details for the multi-billion proposed container terminal expansion.

In a statement issued on Thursday after its AGM, he said the expansion would strengthen the company and Port Klang’s role as the pre-eminent port for the nation’s gateway trade. 

“The expansion would also reinforce the terminal as one of the key transhipment hubs in the South East Asia region for international container shipping alliances,” he said.

Ruben said Westports recorded favourable volume recovery after it had transitioned successfully towards servicing container liners under their current global alliances. 

Westports' total container throughput improved in FY2018 to 9.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). 

Gateway containers increased by 18% to 3.3 million TEUs as its container terminal supported and reflected favourable domestic economic activities while transhipment volume registered a slight increase to 6.2 million TEUs.

In FY2018, Westports accommodated 6,966 container vessels and the company is berthing more and new ultra-large container vessels. 

Westports cited the OOCL United Kingdom, which is the world’s largest container vessel, made its maiden call at Westports in FY2018. 

In recent years, Westports had invested RM2.5bil in the latest state-of-the-art terminal operating equipment, and constructed contiguous linear berth with a deep draft, that would enable its terminal to support our clients’ plans of deploying ever larger vessels.  

Wesports said 62% of its containers in FY2018 were destined for countries and regions within Intra-Asia. 

These containers were loaded at a port in Asia and were subsequently shipped to a destination port within Asia as well. 

Its intra-Asia container volume grew by 14% to 5.9 million TEUs and it underpinned Westports overall throughput growth."
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/uk-regulator-blocks-sainsburys-us$9pt4b-asda-takeover/,UK regulator blocks Sainsbury's US$9.4b Asda takeover,Corporate News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",5:11 PM MYT,"LONDON: Britain's competition regulator on Thursday blocked Sainsbury's proposed 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Walmart owned Asda - a huge blow to the supermarket groups who wanted to combine to overtake market leader Tesco.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruling is also a major setback for Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe, the architect of the deal and the group's boss since 2014.

Coupe made unwanted headlines when he was caught on camera singing: ""We're in the money"" shortly after the deal was announced last April. Analysts said questions will be raised over his future after it failed to win approval.

The deal would have resulted in a substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level, with prices rising in stores, online and at petrol stations, the CMA said.

Coupe took issue with the CMA's analysis.

""The specific reason for wanting to merge was to lower prices for customers,"" he said in a statement.

""The CMA's conclusion that we would increase prices post-merger ignores the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market. The CMA is today effectively taking 1 billion pounds out of customers' pockets.""

Sainsbury's, Walmart and Asda said they had mutually agreed to terminate the transaction, opting not to challenge the CMA's ruling through the courts.

As well as leapfrogging Tesco, the deal would have given Walmart a way to exit Britain, one of the weakest performers in its global portfolio.

Shares in Sainsbury's were down 5.1 percent at 0820 GMT, extending their losses over the last three months to 23 percent.

WORSE OFF SHOPPERS

After delivering a damning provisional report in February, the CMA's final report was equally stern, finding that UK shoppers and motorists would be worse off if Sainsbury's and Asda combined.

""We have concluded that there is no effective way of addressing our concerns, other than to block the merger,"" said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA inquiry group.

Sainsbury's share of the UK grocery market has dropped from 15.8 percent to 15.3 percent in the last year, while Asda's has fallen from 15.6 percent to 15.3 percent, according to data from market researcher Kantar.

All of the big four grocers have lost share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which now have a combined 13.6 percent share. Tesco has 27.4 percent.

Sainsbury's and Asda have argued that their share of the total market for food was smaller than the data indicated because of the emergence of new players like delivery services, but the regulator was not persuaded.

Coupe said he was confident in Sainsbury's strategy, which focuses on own-brand products, and on the quality, provenance and ethical credentials of its food.

Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, said she was disappointed by the CMA's ruling.

""Our focus now is continuing to position Asda as a strong UK retailer delivering for customers. Walmart will ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that,"" she said.

IMPLICATIONS

The implications of the deal failing are likely to be significant. Some analysts believe Sainsbury's will have to undergo a major shake-up that could see new chairman Martin Scicluna part company with Coupe.

Analysts at Jefferies believe the risk of a reinvigorated market leader Tesco continuing to recover customers historically lost to Sainsbury's needs addressing with urgency.

Earlier this month Sainsbury's lost its status as Britain's No. 2 supermarket group by market share to Asda, according to Kantar data. Tesco in contrast is gaining momentum, reporting a 34 percent jump in full-year operating profit on April 10.

With one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart blocked, analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity.

The Sunday Times reported in February that private equity group KKR was mulling an offer for Asda.

But both of these avenues are problematic.

""The problem with the idea of private equity is that the only way PE makes money is to have its own exit and there isn’t one because you can’t break-up Asda now,"" one senior UK supermarket director told Reuters.

""The problem with an IPO is – what growth prospects are you selling? The story to investors is not a very good one,"" he said, adding that Walmart may decide to run Asda as a profit centre and simply instruct CEO Roger Burnley to make them more money. - Reuters"

Energy stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 as oil prices fell. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq had help from eBay Inc's upbeat earnings and a chipmaker rally, investors were digesting a mixed bag of reports.

The S&P 500, closing roughly 0.5% below its intraday record high hit in late September, has rallied about 17% year-to-date. It has been supported by a dovish Federal Reserve, hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and largely upbeat earnings.

But, with big companies such as Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc, reporting after the close on Wednesday and Amazon.com and Intel Corp reports on tap for Thursday afternoon, many investors kept to the sidelines.

""While the expectations are for good reports from all four of them, recent strength and relative valuations are keeping people on the edge of their seat,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

""There was no needle moving news today for people to be making bigger bets on anything after the big move we had yesterday.""

In aftermarket trading, Microsoft shares rose about 3% and Facebook shares gained nearly 5%.

At the market close on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.34 points, or 0.22%, to 26,597.05, the S&P 500 lost 6.43 points, or 0.22%, to 2,927.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.81 points, or 0.23%, to 8,102.02.

Profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline 1.1% for the first quarter, still a large improvement from the 2.3% drop estimated at the start of April. And nearly 78% of the 129 companies that have reported so far have surpassed earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

""The overall picture confirms the economy is on a steady footing. It's skewing to the positive side,"" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management.

""The market is taking a pause,"" she said. ""We've a lot of earnings coming this week and next. There's nothing today that would change the overall economic outlook.""

Only three of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors ended the day in positive territory, and real estate led the gainers with a 0.8% rise. Energy was the biggest decliner with a 1.9% drop.

The technology sector lost its gains late in the session to close down 0.01 percent and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed up 0.95% after hitting an all-time high during the session. Texas Instruments Inc rose 1.8% after its quarterly report.

Caterpillar Inc fell 3% as rising costs hit margins in its construction equipment business and the company reported tepid sales in the Asia-Pacific region.

AT&T Inc was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, declining 4% after the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier reported quarterly revenue below Wall Street estimates.

EBay jumped 5% after the company raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts.

Anadarko Petroleum Corp jumped 11.6%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, after Occidental Petroleum Corp sought to scuttle Chevron Corp's takeover of the company with a $57 billion bid.

Boeing Co closed up 0.38% even after scrapping its 2019 outlook and reporting quarterly revenue below estimates due to grounding of its 737 MAX jets. Its shares have lost about 11% since the deadly Ethiopian crash in early March.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 96 new highs and 37 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 6.57 billion shares changed hands compared with the 6.65 billion-share average for the last 20 sessions.The euro fell against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday after data showed a surprise deterioration in German business morale, raising fears of slowing global growth and weighing on a gauge of world equity markets, including Wall Street.

The decline in the Munich-based Ifo economic institute's business climate index bucked expectations for a small improvement and sent U.S. Treasury yields lower as investors piled into safe-haven bonds.

Reports of a sharp slowdown in Australian inflation also lifted bond prices. Premier Li Keqiang in China fed concerns about global growth, saying authorities should not underestimate the difficulties in the Chinese economy.

Signals that China has put broader stimulus on hold curbed demand for European equities and overshadowed strong earnings from Credit Suisse and SAP, which led Germany's DAX index to close up 0.63% at a six month high.

The 12.6% surge in the German software firm's shares helped technology post its best days since August 2015, but all other major country indexes in Europe closed lower.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.09%, while MSCI's gauge of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.42%.

Wall Street shrugged off some earnings misses but drifted lower at the end of the session. Boeing Co rose 0.39% after the planemaker reported first-quarter free cash flow that was ahead of many analysts' estimates, helped by improved performance from its 787 Dreamliner program.

U.S. corporate earnings have been much better than expected and are driving the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes to new highs, though the pace of gains should slow, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.

""You're seeing a transition, at least for today,"" Arone said. ""There are some concerns that outside the U.S. global growth continues to be disappointing and that's weighing on shares.""

Defensive sectors of the market, REITs, utilities and staples, rose. Cyclical-oriented shares struggled with the renewed growth concerns.

The Nasdaq fell after setting all-time intra-day high. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 set new closing record highs on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.34 points, or 0.22%, to 26,597.05. The S&P 500 lost 6.43 points, or 0.22%, to 2,927.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.81 points, or 0.23%, to 8,102.02.

The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.43% at 98.059, its highest since June 2017.

The euro was down 0.61% at $1.1157, while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.3% versus the greenback at 112.19 per dollar.

In a sign of bullish sentiment, the Treasury yield curve steepened further, hitting its widest level since November 2018. Benchmark 10-year notes rose 14/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.5199%.

Oil prices steadied near six-month highs after data showed U.S. stockpiles rose to their highest levels since October 2017, countering fears of tight supply from OPEC output cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran.

U.S. crude inventories rose 5.5 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, far more than the 1.3 million barrel increase analysts had forecast.

The build in crude stockpiles was ""bearish, especially developing in spite of a larger-than-expected jump in U.S. refinery runs of almost 2.5 percent of capacity,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

Crude futures and prices for spot delivery rallied after the United States said on Monday it would end all exemptions for sanctions against Iran, demanding countries halt oil imports from Tehran from May or face punitive action. The move raised worries about tighter global oil supplies.

The United States must be prepared for consequences if it tries to stop Iran from selling oil and using the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, warned on Wednesday.

China, Iran's biggest oil customer, has formally complained about the move.

The spot price surge put the Brent forward curve into steep backwardation, in which prices for later delivery are cheaper than for prompt dispatch.

Signaling no immediate action to counteract missing Iranian barrels, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday that his country's production in May would not vary greatly from previous months.

He added that Saudi Arabia aimed to stick to its output quota fixed in a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others, known as OPEC+, but that June numbers would be determined depending on customers' needs.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/us-justice-staff-seek-goldman-guilty-plea-in-1mdb-settlement/,US Justice staff seek Goldman guilty plea in 1MDB settlement ,Corporate News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",6:59 AM MYT,"U.S. Department of Justice staff have made an internal recommendation that Goldman Sachs Group Inc plead guilty as part of any potential settlement over its role in a corruption scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.

The Justice Department has not charged Goldman in relation to the state-owned fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, known as 1MDB. Goldman, which is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the Justice Department for its role in bond sales for the fund, has said it has not had settlement talks.

A criminal guilty plea, considered one of the harshest penalties the Justice Department can impose on a company, could potentially expose Goldman to litigation from private parties and result in restrictions on its business, depending on the final terms of any settlement.

The Justice Department announced criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the scandal involving 1MDB, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, last year. Goldman has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying the criminal activities of Leissner and Ng were hidden from the bank's management.

Goldman Sachs spokesman Jake Siewert said in statement on Wednesday the bank does not believe ""a charge would be warranted by the facts of the case or the law, particularly because senior management was unaware of the criminal activity by Mr. Leissner and his associate who took extraordinary efforts to hide their part in the illegal scheme from management, compliance, and legal functions at the firm."" Without a charge, no settlement would be necessary.

The staff recommendation by prosecutors is now being considered by senior officials at the Justice Department, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Goldman's shares closed down 1.8 percent on Wednesday.

The Justice Department does not typically pursue criminal guilty pleas from corporations. In recent years it has tended to negotiate non-prosecution or deferred prosecution agreements that are generally considered to be less damaging to companies.

Banks with criminal convictions can lose access to certain government perks, including a streamlined process to raise funds through securities offerings and the ability to manage American pension funds. They could also have a range of other critical licenses revoked by other regulatory agencies.

In the past, however, the DOJ has ensured that the relevant government regulators would grant waivers that would allow a bank to continue doing such business out of concern that a dramatic upheaval of a major firm could have a negatively affect markets.

In 2015, four large banks – Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays PLC and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC – pleaded guilty to felony charges of trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates. UBS AG pleaded guilty to manipulating benchmark interest rates at the same time. Barclays, Citi, JPM and UBS all received certain waivers.

But such a policy has been under political pressure from Democrats – including Representative Maxine Waters, who now chairs the House of Representative’s banking committee, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president who argue that banks that plead guilty should suffer consequences.

Analysts focused on Goldman had expected the bank to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement, possibly including an admission of wrongdoing. They downplayed the risks to the bank’s business, pointing to the limited overall impact such pleas had had on foreign banks.

""A guilty plea would not be 'game over,' in our view,"" Mike Mayo, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note on Wednesday. ""There's little chance that [Goldman Sachs] would agree to a guilty plea without waivers from government agencies that would allow them to continue to conduct regular business, albeit with better controls.""

According to prosecutors, Goldman generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.

Prosecutors described the bank's system of internal accounting controls as ""easily circumvented"" and said its culture in Southeast Asia was ""highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritising this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions.""

The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009. The U.S. Justice Department estimated that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. - Reuters"

The initiative will use Alibaba Cloud’s artificial intelligence programme as well as big data analytics to produce real-time traffic predictions using video and image recognition technologies to combat traffic congestion in the city. 
The initiative is a localised replication of Alibaba Cloud’s ET City Brain, which was implemented in Hangzhou in 2016.
Kuala Lumpur is the first city to adopt the technology outside of China on a trial basis. 
Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, has implemented this technology in about 10 cities in China to alleviate  traffic congestion. 
Alibaba Cloud Malaysia general manager Kenny Tan told StarBiz that the pilot study carried out in Kuala Lumpur, which took nine months to be completed, showed that 12% of travel time would be reduced in traffic by Malaysians. 
“Malaysians would be saving more than 10 minutes in the traffic congestion. It is a fantastic number for me.  
“The technology will impact Malaysians as it has been in Hangzhou.  
“The impact will be seen by the Malaysians in the near future. ” he said on the sidelines of Securities Industry Development Corp  future business ideas 2019 conference here yesterday. 
Should the  Kuala Lumpur City Council give its final approval for the implementation, Tan said real time traffic prediction solutions would be done in stages as there are around 600 traffic junctions in Kuala Lumpur. 
“We are also open to start in other cities in the country as the pilot study is completed. Now, we are waiting for the authorities. As soon as they agree, we will start rolling out the technology which will improve mobility for Malaysians,” he added. 
Tan disclosed that announcements are most likely to be made next month to shed more light on the approval of the authorities as well as the implementation of the smart city initiative project by the group. 
Alibaba Cloud is the platform provider, whereas Malaysian Digital Economy Corp is leading the data analytics and project management while the Kuala Lumpur City Council provides access to camera live feeds, traffic light and events information. 
Moving forward, Tan expected the group to continue its investments in Malaysia to boost the growth potential of the locals in the technology world.  
In the next three to five years,  he believed that companies would leverage and bank on technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics. 
“It is all about how to use technology to solve problems and not just about digital transformation. Alibaba Cloud will insist in investments in Malaysia,” he added."

Formal talks on the project - a rail line expected to stretch 873 km (542 miles) - began in 2014 but have been beset by delays, including disagreements over design, financing AND technical assistance.

The Thai project is part of China's plan for a network of links across Southeast Asia that would eventually connect Kunming in southwest China with Singapore.

It is also part of a broader Chinese initiative to build infrastructure to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond.

Thailand decided in 2016 against Chinese financing for the project because of high interest rates - a complaint of similar projects in several countries - and decided to fund the 170 billion baht ($5.32 billion) Thai portion of project itself.

So far only the first 3.5 km of the line have been constructed in Thailand, but a Transport Ministry official told Reuters on Tuesday the first section leading to Bangkok should be completed in two to three years.

The project will be re-energised when Thailand, Laos and China sign a three-way memorandum of cooperation on Thursday at a Beijing conference to build a railway bridge connecting the Thai province of Nong Khai and the Lao capital Vientianne, said the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

""The connecting bridge will make the project an example of seamless connectivity in the region,"" Lada Phumas, director of the ministry's East Asia division, told reporters at a news briefing.

""The project is going at its own pace. We must stress that the project is making progress according to our goals,"" she added.

The Belt and Road summit, which takes place from Thursday to Saturday in Beijing, will be attended by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his foreign and transport ministers.

The comments from Thailand come after Malaysia and China agreed on April 12 to resume construction of a 688-km (430 mile) rail project.

""REALLY HAPPENING""

The Thai-Chinese railway is divided into two sections: the first is a 250-km (155 mile) line linking the Thai capital Bangkok and the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima.

That section is expected to be operational in two to three years, Chaiwat Thongkamkoon, permanent-secretary of the Ministry of Transport, told Reuters this week. He could not provide a timeline for the completion of the full project.

The other part links Nakhon Ratchasima and the Thai border at Nongkhai province, where the bridge - the subject of Thursday's agreement - will connect the Thai rail with the Laos network.

The construction of parts of the high-speed rail is done separately in each country. Thailand says it is not accepting financing from China, but using Chinese expertise and buys equipments and rail technology from China.

""That is why this connection area (the bridge between Laos and Thailand) is important. It symbolises that the Belt and Road initiative through this southern corridor is really happening,"" Chaiwat said.

He said back-and-forth discussions between China and Thailand have caused delays, but negotiations on the highly technical train system - consisting of signalling, power, and track-work - are now near completion.

""The Chinese developed the rail initially for their domestic use, and they have come far to export such technology but it is still relatively new for them in transferring their technology to others,"" Chaiwat said, adding that most of the documents, training courses and design were initially in Chinese.

""The negotiation is 90 percent completed and I think a deal can be tabled and signed by both sides in a month's time,"" Chaiwat said.

""After that it's all about construction."" - Reuters"

It said on Thursday it was retaining its Add for MAHB and target price of RM9.47, which was 28% above the last traded price of RM7.40.

CIMB Research said MSCI will be increasing the weighting of China A shares into its indices progressively in May, August and November 2019, resulting in a potential reduction of Malaysia’s weighting. 

As MAHB is a member of certain MSCI indices, its share price may see some periodic selloffs from May until November 2019. 

“In our view, any sell-off is a good chance for investors to accumulate,” it said. 

The research house also pointed out that on April 12, MAHB announced the Cabinet had approved the extension of MAHB’s concession to operate 39 airports in Malaysia from 2034 to 2069. 

While this merely confirms an earlier decision by the previous government, it was a major relief as the present government had considered dismantling MAHB’s airport monopoly. 

MAHB expects to sign the new Operating Agreement (OA) with the government by June 2019, upon which we expect the user fee payments to the government to initially decline, and then no longer increase at a rate faster than revenue, as is the case currently.

“ Also, while four new geographical airport clusters have been established to facilitate the entry of new, third-party private investors and financiers of airport development capex, we believe MAHB will continue to have the ‘right of first refusal’ on any airport capex,” it said. 

CIMB Research also noted that the Malaysian Aviation Commission (MAVCOM) will likely announce decisions on the inputs to the RAB model for aero tariff determination by June, begin a shadow period from July, finalise the inputs by October, and begin official implementation by Jan 1, 2020. 

In its Oct 2018 paper, MAVCOM considered using a real WACC of 7% (nominal WACC of 10%), resulting in a 16% rise in aero tariffs based on RM4bil of airport capex over the first 3-year RAB cycle. 
MAHB is trying to convince MAVCOM to give it more time to raise gearing levels, and to consider applying a higher WACC in the first cycle. 

Also, while MAVCOM had proposed a price cap, MAHB is asking for an aero revenue floor to be in place, to protect it from black-swan events. 

“Eventual introduction of dual-till RAB to drive earnings further  The introduction of dual-till RAB is at the earliest from Jan 1, 2023 (the start of the second RAB cycle), or from the third RAB cycle beginning Jan 1, 2026 as we assume. As the non-aero business wriggles free from regulatory constraints on ROIC, required aero tariffs should rise further, helping make MAHB’s Malaysia business even more profitable,” CIMB Research said."

""This still does not mitigate the company’s high level of borrowings, amounting to RM10.4b as at end-FY18 - implying an alarming net-gearing level of 2.7x,"" said Kenanga research in a note.

It added that it suspects the refinanced tenure may be shorter than what the management was hoping for, while the interest cost could be significantly higher following the refinancing as compared to average interest rates of 4.83% for the revolving credits and 4.94% for the terms loans in FY18.

However, Kenanga added that the debt refinancing, while widely expected, is a positive that allows the company to circumvent its borrowings default risk in the immediate term.

Kenanga maintained its underperform rating on Bumi Armada and raised its target price to 25 sen from the previously distressed valuation of nine sen. 

Moving forward, the research house said the group wll have to continue efforts in managing its cash flow and operation to meet upcoming debt repayments. 

""Operations in one of its biggest asset – the Armada Kraken FPSO, had suffered numerous hiccups over the past year, leading to massive impairments of >RM1.6b on the asset in
FY18. 

""As such, we believe smoothening out all of its FPSO operations is paramount for the company to regain its financial footing,"" it said.

Options for Bumi Armada to raise cash could arise from a favourable outcome from its legal dispute with Woodside Petroleum, possible assset sale or partial stake sale in one of its smoothly operating FPSOs, or cash call from the equity market as a last resort.

Kenanga is not overly positive on reports that the group is close to securing a FPSO contract from ONGC given that it is the only bidder, which could indicate less favourable contract terms in addition to issues relating to its capex funding."

Chotaro Morita, chief rates strategist at SMBC Nikko, noted

hopes that the Chinese economy is bottoming out have contributed to recent rallies in global equities.

""Corporate earnings that have been released so far suggests the worst period for the Chinese economy was over. While that is supportive of share prices, that alone is not enough to keep the rally going for more than a month,"" he said.

The euro sat at $1.1150, having suffered its biggest one-day loss against the dollar since early March.

The deteriorating reading on German business morale, in a survey by the IFO economic institute, bucked expectations for a small improvement.

The new brand identity is in line with AICB’s vision to professionalise the banking industry in Malaysia and beyond, focusing on membership, professional education, assessments and awards as well as thought leadership. The rebranding reflects both the evolution of the Institute as well as its path for the future.

The new logo for AICB stands for Accountability, Integrity, Competence and Being professional — the values championed by AICB. It also reflects the Institute’s focus on being innovative and modern, and its commitment to build a culture of professionalism in the banking industry.

AICB Chief Executive Prasad Padmanaban said: “This rebrand marks a significant step in the Institute’s evolution. Our brand ethos is built on trust, transparency, integrity, ethics and professionalism — values that have kept our Institute successful since 1977 and through our recent transformation to a professional body in 2014.

“We pride ourselves on being the sole professional body for banking in Malaysia, advocating an exemplary level of ethics and professionalism within the banking workforce. 

""With this corporate rebranding, we remain committed to elevating the professional education standards for banking through several innovative initiatives in the key areas of membership, education and thought leadership. 

""With that, I am confident that we will continue to move the needle on professionalism and competency standards for bankers.”

Additionally, the new branding represents change. AICB is evolving because the world is rapidly changing – the Institute is determined to remain relevant and future-proof to meet the needs of the new Banking 4.0 environment.

AICB is the sole professional body for the banking industry in Malaysia governed by a council comprising representatives from Bank Negara Malaysia, The Association of Banks in Malaysia and the Malaysian Investment Banking Association.

It aims to elevate the professional and ethical standards of banking practitioners and create a banking workforce which subscribes to high standards of professional conduct, knowledge and competence.

AICB, previously known as The Institute of Bankers Malaysia (IBBM), has provided banking education since 1977 and was transformed to a professional body in 2014.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/privatisation-promotes-collusion-and-corruption/,Privatisation promotes collusion and corruption,Economy,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",10:59 AM MYT,"KUALA LUMPUR: At the risk of reiterating what should be obvious, the question of private or public ownership is distinct from the issue of competition or market forces. Despite the misleading claim that privatization promotes competition, it is competition policy, not privatization, that promotes competition.

Privatization the problem, not the solution

Instead, privatization has typically been accompanied by collusion, which undermines competitive pricing. Formal and, more commonly, informal collusion is rife. Informal collusion is more likely among those involved in public or transparent bidding to provide privatized or contracted-out services. 

Transparent institutions and arrangements, such as public auctions and open, competitive bidding for contracts, have often been compromised by secret, informal collusion. Typically, those with political connections and insider information are better able to secure lucrative contracts and such other business opportunities.

Greater public transparency and accountability were expected to promote greater efficiency in achieving the public interest while limiting waste and borrowing. But contrary to such claims, privatization itself does not ensure transparency and accountability, or address corruption. As it is rarely implemented on an arm's length basis, it may also contribute to other problems, including new types of corruption.

Hence, privatization does not enhance efficiency except to augment profits. The public sector can be more efficiently run, as in some economies. Hence, the challenge is to ensure that the public sector is better run. Greater public accountability and a more transparent public sector can help ensure greater efficiency in achieving the public and national interest while limiting public sector waste and borrowing.

Ascertain problems to determine solutions

Correlation does not imply causation. An enterprise may be better run after privatization due to managerial reforms, behavioural changes or organizational improvements. But if such improvements could have been achieved without privatization, then one cannot conclude that privatization is needed to bring about desired reforms. 

It is important to consider the organizational and managerial reforms, including incentive changes, which might be desirable to achieve superior outcomes. One should not assume that privatization is the answer regardless of the question or the problem at hand.

After all, many SOEs were set up precisely because the private sector was believed to be unable or unwilling to provide certain services or goods. In many instances, the problems of an SOE are not due to ownership per se, but rather to the absence of explicit, feasible or achievable objectives, or the existence of too many, often contradictory goals. 

In other cases, poor managerial and organizational systems, blocking flexibility, autonomy and needed reforms, as well as cultures supportive of them, may be the key problem. Such reforms may well achieve desired objectives and goals, or even do better, at lower cost, thus proving to be the superior option.

Many SOEs have undoubtedly proven to be problematic and inefficient. However, privatization has not proved to be the universal panacea for the myriad problems of the public sector it has been touted as. As such, the superior option cannot be presumed a priori, but should instead be the outcome of careful consideration of the nature and roots of an organization's malaise. 

SOE reform or government procurement often superior

SOE reform is often a superior option for a variety of reasons although there are no ‘one size fits all' solutions regardless of circumstances. Problems need to be analysed in context and solutions cannot be assumed a priori. 

It would be erroneous to presume that public ownership is always a problem. There may be other problems which are not going to go away without properly identifying and resolving them. 

Desirable changes, resulting in improved performance and outcomes, may take place following the privatization of a particular SOE. But even this does not mean that privatization per se is responsible for these improvements unless state ownership itself has blocked needed changes, in which case there may well be compelling cases for privatization in such situations. 

Another alternative, of course, is government or public procurement. Generally, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are much costlier than government procurement. With a competent government, government procurement is generally more efficient and much cheaper. 

Yet, international trade and investment agreements are eroding the rights of governments to pursue government procurement. With a competent government and an incorruptible civil service, and competent accountable consultants doing good work, efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost-effective than PPP alternatives."

The Chinese group is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc as it explores the potential deal, which could raise about US$500mil, according to the people. 
It aims to sell shares in Lycra as soon as this year and is considering the US as a listing venue, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Ruyi completed the purchase of Lycra from Koch Industries Inc in January, more than 15 months after the deal was announced. Bloomberg News reported that regulatory delays hampered the US$2bil cross border acquisition, which also included brands Coolmax fibers and Thermolite insulation.
Kelvin Ho, the group’s chief strategy officer, said in February that Ruyi was planning an IPO for the Lycra unit within three years. Deliberations for the planned IPO are at an early stage, and details such as fundraising size and timing could change, according to the people. 
Ruyi could later select an additional bank to join the deal, one of the people said.
A representative for Ruyi said the company is considering an IPO for Lycra, though it hasn’t confirmed the listing venue, fundraising size or financial adviser. 
A representative for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Ruyi, which has ambitions of becoming the LVMH of China, is pursuing the listing after a spate of overseas acquisitions of marquee fashion brands, including UK trench coat maker Aquascutum and France’s SMCP SA, whose labels include Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot.
The company is currently focusing on integrating existing brands and easing its dealmaking pace in the short to medium term, chairman Qiu Yafu said in an interview in November. — Bloomberg"

Earnings excluding some items are expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said, raising its guidance. 
Adjusted earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates in the first quarter.
Novartis is shaking up its strategy to spur growth, narrowing its focus on cutting-edge drugs for cancer and rare diseases and betting on treatments such as gene therapies to potentially cure severe illnesses. 
In his first year at the helm, chief executive officer Vas Narasimhan (pic) split with Alcon, ditched a stake in a consumer-health venture and carried out three crucial acquisitions to revamp the Swiss drugmaker.
“This quarter has been all about transformation for us,” Narasimhan said in a television interview.
Novartis is turning to new drugs like Mayzent, a multiple sclerosis treatment that was cleared in the United States last month, as sales of key blockbusters fade. 
Like crosstown rival Roche Holding AG, the company is at a turning point as it works to replace some stalwarts with a new generation of medicines.
The drugmaker expects two more big approvals in the first half of 2019: one for gene therapy Zolgensma, which treats a lethal childhood disease called spinal muscular atrophy, and a new breast cancer drug.
Earnings per share for the first quarter rose to US$1.21, the company said in a statement, beating estimates. The results underscore the significance of psoriasis treatment Cosentyx, which could become the company’s largest medicine in 2019. Sales of the drug surged 41% to US$791mil, exceeding the average analyst prediction of US$775mil.
The earnings also highlight pressure on the generics unit Sandoz, which is set to become a standalone business within the broader company and undergo what Novartis has called a “transformation.” Novartis appointed Richard Saynor as the new chief executive for the unit yesterday. The division had been run by an interim manager after Richard Francis, its previous CEO, left at the end of March.

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/kremlin-offers-oil-giants-us8bil-as-russians-struggle/,Kremlin offers oil giants US$8bil as Russians struggle,Business News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",,"MOSCOW: Vladimir Putin’s poll ratings are down after a tax hike squeezed cash-strapped consumers. But the Kremlin has opened the coffers to give as much as US$8bil this year to another key constituency: oil companies awash in record profits.
The handouts are part of a complex arrangement under which oil companies agree to freeze fuel prices to lessen the burden on consumers, but are then compensated mostly from a rainy-day fund built up from years of austerity. The government agreed to tweak the deal as it extends the price freeze to the second quarter after the oil companies complained the hand outs weren’t good enough.
The decision to boost the payout at a time when the government is cutting spending and boosting revenues amid the threat of further sanctions highlights the sway oil giants hold in modern sRussia. The Finance Ministry has been building up its rainy day funds to safeguard the economy from potential geopolitical turmoil.
“This sets a bad precedent,” said Natalia Orlova, an economist at Alfa Bank in Moscow.
“If we say the wealth fund is untouchable, then it should be untouchable.”
Under an agreement that ran until the end of March, oil companies are reimbursed 60 percent of the price difference between baseline domestic and European fuel prices, if the European price was higher. Payouts will total 300 billion rubles (US$4.7bil), with the bulk coming from the US$59bil wellbeing fund, according to the Finance Ministry.
After some lobbying, the government has now agreed to lower the baseline domestic price for gasoline and diesel, opening the door to an additional payout of as much as 200 billion rubles this year. 
The Finance Ministry is trying to prevent that money coming from the wellbeing fund as well.
Oil companies took in record profits last year and the potential payout this year works out at about a third of the industry’s total investment plan. 
The firms shouldn’t be relying only on compensation and can also cover losses using profits from high oil prices, Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev said in response to questions.
“Any extra compensation at the expense of energy revenue is unfair toward taxpayers, these are funds for future generations,” Kolychev said.
The fuel price freeze itself was aimed at compensating consumers who were left out of pocket by a value-added tax increase and rise in the pension age. 
The measures have pushed inflation to a three-year high and sent some measures of Putin’s popularity to the lowest in a decade.
The freeze may be extended into the third quarter to prevent a sudden fuel price rise during harvest season, according to Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at brokerage BCS Financial Group in Moscow. — Bloomberg"

That could spur a rally in the krona, this year’s worst-performing major currency, said NatWest Markets and Danske Bank A/S.The krona has fallen more than 3% this year to trade around 10.50 per euro, confounding predictions it would be the top performer among peers as Riksbank began removing crisis-era stimulus. It is still tipped in a Bloomberg survey to end 2019 as the best among the Group-of-10 currencies.Below is a selection of analysts’ views on the krona’s outlook:Strategists at NatWest Markets, including Nick Mannion, say markets “underestimate” the shift in the Riksbank’s reaction function in recent months.The central bank will reiterate plans for a rate hike in the second half of 2019, with only marginal downward revisions at most to the rate path. This will be “interpreted hawkishly” by markets, reinforcing policy divergence versus the European Central Bank (ECB), according to Mannion, who recommends staying short euro to krona (EUR/SEK).The weak krona should also likely reduce sensitivity to a dovish ECB. While near-term inflation forecasts will be revised lower, NatWest strategists expect the Riksbank to remain relatively optimistic on medium-term inflation prospects. Expect Riksbank to come across as hawkish at the April meeting, SEK could break below 10.40 to euro and a test of 10.20 could possibly be in the cards, according to Christin Tuxen, head of currency strategy at Danske. Danske strategists have lowered their one to three-month EUR/SEK targets to 10.35 (from 10.50) and 10.20 (from 10.40). Do not underestimate the volatility of the cross in response to Riksbank actions this week, Tuxen cautions. Should the Riksbank lower the rate path after all, EUR/SEK could once again challenge the 10.60 highs – not a central case Sees krona coming under selling pressure only later this year – have lifted their six to 12-month forecasts to 10.40 (from 10.30) and 10.50 ( from 10.30). While bank’s central scenario is for a small downward revision in the policy path for the second half of 2019, it still sees a 30% chance of a hike being signalled, in which case EUR/SEK could fall.It is very unlikely that the Riksbank will revise its rate path downward all the way to the “very soft” market pricing, according to analysts at Nordea, including Mats Hyden. The risk-reward for betting on a soft rate decision is poor. There are unusually many alternatives for this week’s Riksbank scenarios.Expect the Riksbank to stick to the same message that anticipates the next rate hike coming during the second half of 2019, says Alexandre Dolci, currency strategist at BBVA.Tone might be somewhat tweaked as the new repo rate path could suggest that a December move has now become more likely than a September/October one.Krona could be at risk of renewed slippage, which would then eventually see EUR/SEK revisiting its recent highs above 10.60. Would use that weakness to “reload EUR/SEK shorts” due to Sweden’s superior outlook versus the eurozone, unless the Riksbank surprises the market with a sharp U-turn and sounds overly dovish. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/turkey-not-keen-to-buy-more-oil-from-saudi-uae/,"Turkey not keen to buy more oil from Saudi, UAE",Business News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",,"ANKARA: Turkey is loath to buy more oil from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the US looks to squeeze exports from Iran, currently the third largest supplier of crude to the Middle East’s biggest economy.
“Iranian oil isn’t cheap but there is a big difference” with the price of Saudi and UAE crude, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a reception in Ankara, according to state-run TRT television. “The US is taking a decision and wants all countries to comply with it. Why should we pay the price?”
The Trump administration is ending waivers that allowed a handful of countries including Turkey to continue importing oil from sanctioned Iran a year after the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he’s confident the market will remain stable as Saudi Arabia and the UAE will ensure an “appropriate supply” of oil along with the US
Turkey is resisting the idea of buying oil from America’s two anti-Iranian allies, whose relations with Ankara are fraught with tension after the murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul last October. Turkey has also long opposed the US curbs on Iran, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying last year that “such sanctions are aimed at tipping the balance in the world” and violate international law and diplomacy.
The blowback from American sanctions against Iran could also hit Turkey’s economy, which entered its first recession in a decade last year as oil prices surged. 
The prospect of higher prices or the risk of a confrontation with the US don’t bode well for Turkey’s currency, already battered by weeks of upheaval.
“Turkey could very soon find itself in a difficult position at the time when inflation remains stubbornly high close to 20%,” said Piotr Matys, a London-based analyst at Rabobank. “Iranian oil could be the source of another diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington, when the relationship is already tense due to Turkey’s insistence on buying a Russian missile-defense system.”
China, India and Turkey aren’t necessarily committed to bringing imports of Iranian crude down to zero and the US will have to negotiate “over the terms of their withdrawal from Iran or be prepared to deal with their noncompliance,” according to a report by Richard Nephew published by Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.
In January, Iran accounted for just over 12% of Turkey’s oil imports, according to the latest available official data. 
Iraq was the top supplier with almost 24%, followed by Russia with 15%. 
Saudi Arabia ranked 8th with 4.3%. Turkey only imported diesel fuel from the UAE in January.
Meanwhile, Iraqi oil pipelines running to Turkey have been badly damaged, limiting the volume of exports, Cavusoglu said. While that’s limiting Turkey’s options, it remains wary of turning to supplies from the Gulf.
“Our refineries aren’t compatible with oil purchased from there,” Cavusoglu said referring to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
“Their technology must be upgraded. And for that, they should be shut down for awhile.
“On the other hand, it is costly.” — Bloomberg"

Leong Hup International Bhd, which owns livestock feed mills and poultry businesses in five countries, is targeting to raise up to RM1.2bil in its IPO that includes an over-allotment option.
The IPO price values Leong Hup at about RM4bil, giving it the crown of the most valuable poultry producer on Bursa Malaysia.
The company is launching its prospectus today.
Under the IPO, Leong Hup will be making an offer for sale and issuance of new stock totalling 937.5 million shares.
The bulk of these shares will be taken up by 10 cornerstone investors which include the Employees Provident Fund, the AIA Group, global agriculture merchant group Louis Dreyfus Company as well as local tycoons Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan and Tan Sri Chua Ma Yu.
About 98 million shares will be made available to the Malaysian public at a maximum price of RM1.10 a share.
Lau, who is the executive director and group chief executive officer of Leong Hup, told StarBiz that a significant portion of the proceeds to be raised from the IPO would be used to fund its regional expansion.
“We are looking at countries with strong population growth,” he said.
Leong Hup in October last year had submitted a plan to sell up to 1.6 billion shares in its IPO to raise cash to reduce its debt and pay for its expansion.
But subdued investor sentiment, which contributed to QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd’s decision earlier this month to put its listing plan on hold, prompted Leong Hup to scale down the size of its IPO.
QSR Brands is the operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut chain of restaurants in Malaysia and was reported to be seeking to raise RM2bil in its shelved IPO.
Despite the reduced size, Leong Hup’s IPO will be the biggest since Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, which raised RM3.77bil in July 2017.
Leong Hup is one of the major suppliers of broiler chicken in the country with an estimated 10% market share. It also controls about a quarter of the day-old-chicken market.
But the main appeal about Leong Hup is the company’s fast-growing overseas business.
The group’s venture in Vietnam has already achieved an annual revenue of over RM1bil, contributing about 18% of the group’s total in 2017, head of operations there Lau Joo Hong said in November.
Leong Hup’s prospectus, to be launched today, will provide investors, for the first time in about seven years, a clear picture of the company’s operations in five countries and its latest financial performance.
Leong Hup was the first poultry company to be listed on Bursa Malaysia in 1990 before it was taken private in 2012 by the founding Lau family.
In 2014, it was reported that the Lau family had sold a 23% stake in the company to Singapore-based private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners.
Lau, in a recent interview, said the company has, over the past five years, grown into a major regional player growing businesses in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines.
For the expansion in the Philippines, Lau said the company would replicate its proven business model in Vietnam there.
“We will stick to what we know best, the poultry business,” he said.
The listing exercise will provide the company with fresh capital to accelerate its expansion in the Philippines and other markets.
Lau said the company is already looking at opportunities in Cambodia, as well as expanding its downstream business."

“Certainly, public investment would be supportive of growth in the medium term from a gross domestic product perspective,” lead economist for Malaysia Richard Record told reporters at the East Asia and Pacific economic update briefing here yesterday.
He, however, urged the government to exercise caution on projects that were being carried out so that the benefits to the people were maximised.
“Once projects are under implementation, the government needs to think very carefully and work hard to ensure careful project management, competitive selection, public procurement and efficient management to ensure the maximum returns on public invested asset,” he said.
The government announced the resumption of the ECRL project on April 12 and the revival of Bandar Malaysia on April 19.
On the weakening ringgit, Record advised the government to focus on the underlying fundamentals of the economy instead of the short-term volatility.
He said the underlying fundamentals of a diversified economy benefited from various sources of growth, domestic and foreign, manufacturing for export, domestic consumption as well as a range of sectors and areas.
“Perhaps, the focus there is on strengthening those fundamentals and how Malaysia can improve its productivity and competitiveness over the medium term, and that would drive the exchange rate over the medium term,” he said.
Nevertheless, Record said, the weakening of the ringgit currently was benefiting the country’s external competitiveness.
“An exchange rate that has weakened somewhat helps in terms of external competitiveness in times of slowing global growth. It doesn’t hurt to have a weaker exchange rate in terms of export performance,” he said.
The ringgit opened lower against the US dollar yesterday at 4.1270/1300 against the greenback from 4.1250/1300 at the close on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Record urged Malaysia to reduce its dependency on oil-related income and diversify its revenue sources to mitigate future shocks.
“As part of Malaysia’s fiscal consolidation effort, there have been some reforms, including the shift to the sales and services tax from the goods and services tax, and the relative share of oil and gas-related earnings as part of public sector revenue has increased,” he said.
He said the increased dependency on oil and gas meant that Malaysia was more vulnerable to changes in oil and gas prices.
“If a major shock were to occur, it would have an impact on public sector revenues, and that is something to think about over the medium term.
“In the same way that Malaysia’s economy is very diversified and provides the source of strength, we would encourage the government to have diversified sources of revenue as well as to be more resilient against potential shocks in the future,” he said. — Bernama"

The arrival of top banking executives in Riyadh puts the finishing touches on a six-month charm offensive after their initial protests over the murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi.
HSBC Holdings Plc’s chief executive officer John Flint and BlackRock Inc’s Larry Fink, who skipped a gathering of elites in the Saudi capital in the aftermath of the killing, are among speakers at a two-day financial conference, which started yesterday.
Khashoggi was murdered in October after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Questions have centred on whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about or ordered the killing, a possibility US intelligence agencies consider likely, and whether the Trump administration would be willing to sacrifice its strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia to hold him accountable.
While the US has blacklisted 16 Saudi nationals for their role in the killing, the diplomatic crisis for business has proved to be little more than a blip. An about 40%t increase in oil prices since the start of the year has helped too.
“I don’t think the global investor community has ever shunned Saudi Arabia,” Jamal Al Kishi, Deutsche Bank AG’s chief executive officer for the Middle East and Africa, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV ahead of the conference. 
“The attendance here, transactions being done for and in Saudi Arabia over the last few months, all indicate an unwavering commitment to the country and a very enduring appetite for Saudi Arabia and the risk profile it offers.”
Saudi Arabia has been home to some of the world’s hottest deals this year, as Europe and Asia have languished. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc this month helped Saudi Aramco raise US$12bil of bonds in one of the most oversubscribed debt offerings in history.
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are also advising the oil firm on its US$69bil acquisition of local chemical giant Sabic. Spokesmen for Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, HSBC and BlackRock all declined to comment.

Its executive director Datuk Seri Ghazali Mohd Ali notes that Boustead is an asset-rich company which has potential for growth, but the company must continue to reinvent itself. 
“What got us here, would not get us there. 
“There is a clear prospect for the group ahead,” he told reporters after the group’s AGM yesterday. 
The annual shareholders’ meeting lasted for almost three hours, which saw three out of 11 resolutions not carried, including Datuk Wira Megat Abdul Rahman Megat Ahmad’s removal as the director of Boustead.
He has been on the board of Boustead for more than 12 years.
Ghazali said that the group had laid out plans that include disposing of non-core assets and reducing stakes in some of its listed companies.
The company also plans on improving cost and operational efficiency.
“We have plans in place to turn around the company. 
“We will be welcoming our new managing director Datuk Seri Amrin Awaluddin on May 6 and we will be discussing on bringing Boustead group to the next phase of growth,” he said.
Boustead shares have been under pressure, falling to its all-time low of RM1.22 a share last week after the group slipped into the red last year.
For the financial year 2018, Boustead registered a loss of RM469.2mil.
This compared with a net profit of RM690.14mil in FY17. 
Its revenue for the period was marginally lower at RM10.18bil from RM10.23bil a year earlier.
Ghazali pointed out that asset monetisation has been part of the group strategy to disposed of its non-core assets.
“We are in the midst of disposing of our Royale Chulan Bukit Bintang Hotel located along Jalan Bukit Bintang,” he said.
The proceeds from the sale would be used to pare down the group’s borrowings,” he said.
Ghazali revealed that Boustead is eyeing to dispose of another one or two assets including its land in Jalan Cochrane and Mutiara Damansara, as well as some properties.
Boustead owned substantial stakes in several listed companies on Bursa Malaysia, namely Boustead Plantations Bhd  (57.4%), Boustead Heavy Industries Corp  Bhd (65%), Affin Bank Bhd (20.7%) and Pharmaniaga Bhd  (56%).
When asked if Boustead Holdings would dispose some of its stakes in these companies, Ghazali hinted that it would be part of the said plan which will be discussed with Amrin.
“Amrin has vast experience, especially in property development and finance. 
“We have put the framework in place to bring the company forward,” the executive director said.

The baht weakened to as low as 32.049 per dollar, the weakest level since Jan 9, and falling through the psychological support of 32. 
It was down 0.2% at 32.020, after falling through the 100-day moving average for the first time since mid-December earlier this week.
Sentiment for the Thai currency has deteriorated as concerns about political stability linger after the nation held its first general election in March since the 2014 coup. 
The Office of the Ombudsman said Tuesday that it has accepted a petition seeking a review by a court on whether the election should be annulled. 
A Pheu Thai party candidate who won a constituency seat in the election will be banned from politics for at least one year for allegedly buying votes, according to the Election Commission.
“As for domestic factors, we have hick-ups in the political landscape and also have some of the impact from the dividend season” that contributed to the weaker baht, said Roong Sanguanruang, a market analyst at Bank of Ayudhya Pcl in Bangkok. 
The decline should be limited as “the fundamentals are still looking sound, if you look at the external position of Thailand,” she pointed out. 
The bank expects a recovery of the baht to 31.75 by end-June.
The baht has weakened 0.9% against the dollar this quarter, following a 2.5% gain in the first three months of 2019. 
It has fallen seven of the past 10 years through 2018 in the second quarter partly due to foreign repatriation of Thai dividend payments and a seasonal fall in tourist demand. 
The amount of dividends to be paid to foreigners in April and May is estimated at 87.6 billion baht (US$2.7bil), about the same as last year, according to estimates by Kasikornbank Pcl. — Bloomberg"

Samsung, which now leads the market for the memory chips used in devices from servers to smartphones, said it plans to ramp up investment in semiconductors in the years leading up to 2030 to take the lead in so-called logic chips. 
It aims to create 15,000 production and research jobs over that period to become the world leader in a field dominated by its US rivals. Shares in chipmaking gear providers such as Signetics Corp and Alpha Holdings Inc rose in Seoul.
Samsung, which is also looking to challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co in the business of making chips for other corporations, joins companies from Huawei Technologies Co to Apple Inc that’re increasingly devising the brains that power computing devices. 
The South Korean company has profited by designing its own microprocessors for devices such as Galaxy phones, but Intel has a commanding lead in the market for central processing units used in PCs and servers.
“It’s rare for Samsung to detail such a long-term plan,” said Yoo Jong-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. 
“It’s an expression of Samsung’s commitment in a chip business that includes not only Intel but also a variety of chipmakers, such as in mobile processors.”
Samsung unveiled the investment plans the same week it suffered a setback in its mobile phone business. The company indefinitely postponed the April 26 launch of the highly touted Galaxy Fold after problems emerged with early test versions of the device. 
Samsung’s first-ever foldable smartphone was supposed to usher in a new era for mobile and revitalise growth in the sector.
The decades-long chip outlay may be aimed at keeping up with its main rivals. TSMC for instance has earmarked US$10bil to US$11bil of spending for 2019 alone.

The five-year securities will allow an affiliate of SoftBank to acquire Wirecard shares at €130 each, Munich-based Wirecard said in a statement yesterday. That’s about 5% more than the stock’s close on Tuesday in Germany. The companies also agreed on a strategic partnership for digital payments. Bloomberg News earlier reported that SoftBank could acquire 5% of Wirecard, whose American depositary receipts jumped on the news.
“SoftBank Group will seek to support Wirecard’s geographic expansion into Japan and South Korea, as well as providing collaboration opportunities within SoftBank Group’s global portfolio in digital payments, data-analytics/AI and other innovative digital financial services,” Wirecard said in its statement.
A representative for Tokyo-based SoftBank declined to comment on Tuesday.
A cash injection by SoftBank could help shore up investor confidence at Wirecard after a series of reports published by the Financial Times since January that alleged accounting wrongdoing at the company’s Singapore operations. Wirecard has seen its market capitalisation – which topped Deutsche Bank AG earlier this year – cut by about a quarter to €15.3bil.
Wirecard has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said an internal investigation cleared it of material faults. It said on April 5 that an accounting executive who has been at the center of fraud allegations at the Singapore business has left the company. The German financial regulator BaFin had banned short trading for two months until lifting the restriction on Friday.
Wirecard’s American depositary receipts (ADR) gained 6.8% to US$71.79 at the close in New York. Each ADR is equal to half a regular company share.
The agreement with SoftBank followed weeks of discussions by the companies’ top management, sources said. SoftBank could buy more Wirecard shares on the market at a later stage, a source said. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/debt-ghosts-return-to-rattle-argentinas-push-for-shale-greatness/,Debt ghosts return to rattle Argentina’s push for shale greatness,Business News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",,"NEW YORK: To replicate the kind of shale boom taking place in America’s Permian Basin, Argentina first needs to convince investors it can avoid another financial crisis.Production is creeping up in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta formation, where about 1,000 wells have been drilled since development started more than six years ago. But fears the government is losing the battle to contain inflation and return to economic normalcy are pushing up bond yields to the highest since the country was last in default.That’s putting off oil investors and preventing Argentina from fully exploiting one of biggest and best shale deposits in the world, according to Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui.“With yields that Argentine bonds have today it’s very difficult to justify any project, even if the quality of the resource is very good,” Lopetegui, a former airline chief executive officer who took over the energy portfolio in January, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Buenos Aires.Rock quality in Vaca Muerta, a Maryland-sized formation in Patagonia, is highly regarded across the industry. Engineers were recently impressed by the longest wells yet, with horizontal sections of four km. But it’s not enough to mitigate the cost of raising money, Lopetegui said. That’s jeopardising the government’s target for annual investment growth of 10% to 15% in shale.Spending was by no means insignificant last year, with drillers injecting more than US$4bil.This year, state-run YPF SA will invest US$1.5bil in shale oil. Exxon Mobil Corp is also on the cusp of spending US$800mil a year to ramp up development, Lopetegui said. That’d come after it bought a 21% stake in November in a pipeline that transports crude from Vaca Muerta.“They are very, very excited – they say the quality of the rock is much better than what they have in the Permian,” Lopetegui said. Exxon declined to comment.Lopetegui acknowledged that US$800mil a year is “peanuts” for an oil major like Exxon. But if Argentina could lure several similar investments, he said, that’d be enough to help transform Vaca Muerta into a rival to US shale plays.A few hundred million dollars a year can make all the difference. If drillers spend US$5bil a year in Vaca Muerta, production in five years can soar to more than the equivalent of a million barrels of oil a day, according to Houston-based consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. If they spend just US$3bil, output would stall at around 400,000 barrels.Permian fields in western Texas and south-eastern New Mexico produce about 4 million barrels of oil a day.Enough light oil is already being produced in Vaca Muerta to turn Argentina into a regular exporter in the second half of the year, Lopetegui said.There are also big plans afoot for exports of shale gas.Pan American Energy Group, whose owners include BP Plc and China’s CNOOC Ltd, is mulling construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in neighbouring Chile, Lopetegui said. After sending the gas across the Andes through existing pipelines, it’d be liquefied and shipped from the Pacific. YPF is also searching for partners to build an LNG terminal on Argentina’s Atlantic coast. — Bloomberg"
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/04/25/bayer-ceo-faces-growing-opposition-from-shareholders/,Bayer CEO faces growing opposition from shareholders,Business News,"Thursday, 25 Apr 2019",,"BERLIN: Bayer AG is facing mounting opposition ahead of what’s shaping up to be its most contentious annual meeting in years, with influential shareholders faulting management for failing to foresee the risks of the company’s biggest deal.
A growing number of shareholders have said they won’t support executives and supervisory board members in a no-confidence vote at Friday’s annual meeting in Bonn, Germany. Though the vote has no legal weight, a low enough approval rating would throw into question the future of the leaders who orchestrated the US$63bil acquisition of US agriculture giant Monsanto.
Buying Monsanto was supposed to secure Bayer’s position in the rapidly consolidating agrochemicals market and deter outside forces from trying to split up the company, which sells everything from aspirin and cancer medicines to shoe inserts and soybean seeds. Instead, lawsuits linked to Monsanto’s contentious weedkiller Roundup sparked the biggest and quickest loss of value in the history of Germany’s blue-chip DAX Index.
“In all good conscience, we can’t exculpate management if so much shareholder value is destroyed,” said Ingo Speich, chief of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, one of Bayer’s top-10 shareholders with a stake just shy of 1%. Deka will vote against discharging both Bayer’s management and supervisory boards for their actions last year, Speich said.
An approval rating below 80% would be “damaging to the reputation” of Bayer’s management, Speich said. “If you have 20% of shareholders against you, that’s a lot.”
Bayer’s biggest shareholder, BlackRock Inc, intends to abstain from the vote, according to a source. The fund manager, which controls 6.4% of Bayer’s shares, declined to comment. Deutsche Bank AG’s asset manager DWS, another large shareholder in Bayer, also plans to abstain from voting on management approval, according to sources. DWS declined to comment.
To help rally votes in its favour, Bayer is working with its usual outside advisers D.F. King & Co, sources said. Bayer declined to comment on individual shareholders’ votes or on its advisers. 
The company has defended the Monsanto deal, saying its executives diligently reviewed the risks connected with Roundup and that there’s no scientific proof the weedkiller’s main ingredient, glyphosate, causes cancer.
Deka and other top shareholders stopped short of calling for the replacement of chief executive officer Werner Baumann, one of the Monsanto deal’s main architects. With the company facing challenges on several fronts beyond the Monsanto litigation, a new leader from outside the German giant would need too much time to get oriented, Speich said.
German shareholder association DSW, which advises small investors on proxy issues, called for Friday’s vote to be postponed. Deciding on discharging management now would “strain relations” between the company and shareholders, the association said.
Smaller shareholders including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Florida State Board of Administration and Australia’s Local Government Super have voted against management, filings show.
Friday’s results depend in large part on how many shareholders follow the recommendations of influential proxy advisers Glass Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. Both called for a vote of no confidence in Baumann and other senior executives, while Glass Lewis called for supervisory-board members also not to be discharged of responsibility. — Bloomberg"

Lead economist for Malaysia Richard Record said private consumption would continue to be the main driver of growth, albeit expanding at a more measured pace.
“Household spending will be buoyed by stable labour market conditions and income support measures such as the cost of living aid,” he told reporters at the East Asia and Pacific economic update briefing here yesterday.
He said gross fixed capital formation was expected to increase slightly, driven by the private sector, while public investment was expected to remain subdued in the near term.
“The external sector may be negatively affected by heightened uncertainty surrounding the global environment, particularly the possible escalation of US-China trade tensions,” he said.
Record said monetary poverty was expected to continue its downward trend in 2019, with a projected decline to 1.4% based on the upper middle-income countries poverty line of US$5.50 per person per day in 2011.
“Several initiatives for low-income households, including the national B40 health protection fund, an insurance scheme for the B40 group, and affordable housing initiatives are in the pipeline to improve both monetary and non-monetary wellbeing,” he said.
Going into 2020, he said Malaysia’s economy was projected to expand at 4.6%, and the country was expected to achieve high-income country status by 2024.
He said the country’s fiscal deficit was expected to narrow to 3.4% of GDP in 2019 and subsequently to 3% in 2020.
“Near-term fiscal consolidation efforts are expected to be achieved primarily through rigorous expenditure rationalisation,” he added. — Bernama"

Ananda Krishnan’s Bumi Armada Bhd  may have averted bankruptcy for the moment via its multi-billion-ringgit debt refinancing, but the loss-making company continues to be highly geared and will incur an additional RM40mil in interest expenses.
Speaking to StarBiz, an equity analyst welcomed the move by the offshore energy facilities and service provider to refinance its unsecured term loans of US$380mil (RM1.57bil) and revolving credit facilities of US$280mil (RM1.16bil), which have been delayed for some time.
However, the debt refinancing is only seen as a stop-gap measure, he said.
The unsecured term loans and revolving credit facilities will be refinanced into a single facility comprising a Tranche 1 facility of US$260mil (RM1.07bil) and Tranche 2 facility of US$400mil (RM1.65bil).
The Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 debt facilities will be repayable over two and five years, respectively, from the closing date of the agreement.
“The debt refinancing is good news because Bumi Armada has escaped liquidation, but this doesn’t change the balance sheet.
“In fact, the new loan facility would incur a higher interest rate, up by 1.5 basis points. With a higher interest expense, the bottom line would be slashed by RM40mil for financial year 2019 (FY19),” he said.
In FY18 ended Dec 31, Bumi Armada recorded a net loss of RM2.3bil on the back of a total revenue of RM2.42bil.
Ananda Krishnan is the controlling shareholder of Bumi Armada, holding a 34.87% stake via Objektif Bersatu Sdn Bhd.
As a result of the corporate debt refinancing exercise, Bumi Armada emerged as Bursa Malaysia’s most active stock yesterday. Its shares rose 35% or seven sen to 27 sen, with a total of 774.51 million shares changing hands.
The stock, which has been slumping for about a year, hit its five-month high yesterday.
A dealer said that the surge in the company’s shares was expected, as the delayed debt refinancing plan was finally achieved yesterday. However, he said investors should consider taking profit from the stock, given the company’s negative outlook.
“The latest news does not change the company’s outlook. I believe it will undertake capital raising exercises in the future to sustain its operations,” he said.
According to Bloomberg data, only two research houses have recommended a ”buy” call on Bumi Armada, while seven brokerages have recommended a “sell” call. Six research houses have “hold” calls.
The 12-month consensus target price, according to Bloomberg, is 18 sen.
Commenting on the refinancing, Bumi Armada executive director and chief executive officer Leon Harland said the new facility better aligned the corporate debt profile with the cash flow profile of the group’s main floating production and operation (FPO) business.
“The group must now focus on maximising its revenue while continuing to manage its operational costs, as well as finding additional value via asset monetisation or other structural improvements.
“As part of this, the offshore marine services’ assets together with certain FPO vessels which are idle will be disposed of, assuming commercially acceptable sale terms can be obtained. Surplus funds from operations and part of the proceeds from certain strategic initiatives including monetisation of assets and new project financing will be used to repay the loans,” he said."

The China Securities Regulatory Commission agreed with Goldman Sachs under guidelines that allow it to negotiate a settlement rather than to simply issue a fine.
The deal relates to how Goldman Sachs's Asia unit worked with Beijing Gao Hua Securities Co., the majority owner of the onshore joint venture, on its trading business. Employees at both firms have agreed to step up internal controls, the CSRC said in a statement late Tuesday.
The settlement underscores Chinese regulators' willingness to use new approaches to supervision as they increase scrutiny of financial markets. Fines and confiscations levied by the CSRC reached a record $1.59bil last year, according to official data.
""This case represents a major breakthrough in the history of China's securities regulatory and administrative law enforcement,"" said Melody Yang, a Beijing-based partner at Simmons &amp; Simmons. ""We expect this approach will be more widely accepted by the market.""
A total of nine parties, including Goldman Sachs and Beijing Gao Hua, will pay 150mil yuan ($22mil) to settle the case, according to the CSRC notice. It didn't identify the rest.
""We are pleased to have resolved the matter,"" a spokeswoman who represents Goldman Sachs and Beijing Gao Hua said.
Between October 2013 and July 2015, traders at Goldman Sachs's Asian unit used its account held with Beijing Gao Hua to carry out trades and provided ""business guidance"" to staff at Beijing Gao Hua, according to the CSRC notice.

AmInvestment Research is maintaining its “buy” call with unchanged forecasts and sum-of-parts-based (SOP) fair value of RM6.50 a share, which implies an FY19F PE of 20 times or 33% below Dialog’s 30 times, the company’s closest peer in Malaysia. 
It said Serba Dinamik’s foreign debt accounts for 40% of gross debt of RM1.7bil as at Dec 31, 2018, of which RM496mil (US$120mil) is scheduled to be repaid this year. 
“Hence, the group is earmarking US$80mil to US$130mil for engineering, procurement and construction projects in Laos, Tanzania and Uzbekistan, as well as working capital for Middle Eastern operation and maintenance contracts.
“While the group has already issued a RM800mil sukuk programme in October last year and retained the outstanding proceeds of RM419mil from its RM407mil IPO in February 2017 and RM427mil private placement in January 2018, this new foreign-denominated debt issue circumvents the conversion of the ringgit, which requires Bank Negara approval,” it said.
S&P Global Ratings has assigned a preliminary BB- rating for long-term issuer credit and guarantees. 
Fitch Ratings has accorded a long-term issuer default rating of BB- with a stable outlook. 
These could mean an interest rate of 5.5%, higher than Serba Dinamik’s average gross interest rate of 5.1% in FY18. 
“We are neutral on this development, which is part of the group’s financing programme for international expansion. 
“While net gearing has risen to 0.45 times as at 4QFY18 from 0.29 times in 4QFY17 due to the pipeline of multiple projects, management reaffirms that Serba Dinamik does not require any equity-raising exercise. 
“Management expects the continuation of strong revenue growth this year driven by growing demand in the Middle East and South-East Asia, spearheaded by the UAE and Qatar,” AmInvest Research said. 
Most of the growth will be underpinned by Serba Dinamik’s operation and maintenance services, which account for 89% of the group’s FY18 revenues.  
Serba Dinamik is currently trading at a grossly undervalued FY19F PE of 12 times versus over 30 times for Dialog Group Bhd .

At 5pm yesterday, the stock ended five sen up to RM1.31, with 31.5 million shares done.
Bloomberg had reported that FGV and  Lembaga Tabung Haji  (TH) were considering selling plantation assets in Indonesia as the government-linked entities seek to improve their financial position.
The news wire, quoting sources, said FGV and TH were working with an adviser to gauge potential buyer interest in Trurich Resources Sdn Bhd, which controls 103,800 acres of oil palm estates in Kalimantan, Indonesia. They may seek to value Trurich at as much as US$1bil including debt.
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has been seeking to clean up the balance sheets of state-backed companies after a global scandal erupted over the previous government’s stewardship of the 1MDB investment fund.
The deal would help Trurich’s owners offload assets that have been the subject of contention. Trurich said in December it filed a police report alleging that former senior management of the pilgrims fund misled the company into overpaying for Indonesian land purchases between 2008 and 2009.
The executives haven’t publicly responded to the allegations, Bloomberg said.
FGV swung to a net loss of RM208.8mil in the fourth quarter of last year, from a net income of RM50.4mil a year earlier.
The company has been focused on implementing new controls to bring its plantations’ performance in line with other large players in industry, group chief executive officer Datuk Haris Fadzilah Hassan said in February.
Meanwhile, KAF Seagroatt & Campbell in a report yesterday had a buy call on FGV with a target price of RM1.50.
Earlier this month, AllianceDBS Research also had a buy call on FGV, with a target price of RM1.75.
“It is in the government’s best interest for FGV to do well since Felda owns 33.6% stake in FGV. The government intends to enhance corporate governance at Felda and FGV. This bodes well for FGV,” the research house said."

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, the identification products and solutions provider said it had commenced legal proceedings in the Kuala Lumpur High Court against nine defendants. 
The defendants listed are Tan Sri Razali Ismail, Datuk Tan Say Jim, Datuk Seri Shahbuddin Tunku Besar Burhanuddin, Datuk Hamdan Mohd Hassan, Datuk Eow Kwan Hoong, Chan Feoi Chun, Syed Abdullah Syed Abd Kadir, Datuk Noor Ehsanuddin Mohd Harun Narrashid and Datuk Nik Azman Mohd Zain.
“The suit concerns the company’s investment in Border Control Solutions Ltd (BCS). 
“The company brought this action for loss suffered from the defendants’ failure to discharge their respective fiduciary duty, duty of fidelity and/or duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence as directors of the company at that material time,” said Iris.
Iris said it is seeking RM11.72mil, being the total amount paid by the company for the subscription of BCS’ shares, which is equivalent to a total sum of £2.05mil by reference to the conversion rates prevailing on the respective dates of payments.
It is also seeking RM482,172 being the total amount paid to Joseph Vijay Kumar as consultant fees, which is equivalent to a total sum of £84,000 by reference to the conversion rates prevailing on the respective dates of payments.
The company is also claiming pre-judgment and post-judgment interests at a rate of 5% per annum on both the sums that it is seeking, as well as general damages, interest on the general damages awarded, costs and/or all other relief that the court deems fit and just.
Save for the legal cost arising from this litigation, Iris said the litigation is not expected to have any material financial impact on the company.
Iris recorded a net profit of RM5.17mil in its third quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, compared with a net loss of RM45.51mil in the previous corresponding period.
The loss in the previous corresponding quarter was mainly due to recognition of a non-cash allowance for impairment loss amounting to RM28.1mil in relation to a trusted identification project overseas, as well as losses from foreign exchange of RM6.4mil due to the strengthening of the ringgit against the dollar and euro.
Revenue in the third quarter dropped to RM42.97mil from RM64.98mil a year earlier, Iris said in its notes accompanying its third-quarter results."

RHB, like many of its regional peers, had previously had to make provisions for its oil and gas (O&G) accounts particularly, in Singapore due to the-then beleaguered O&G market.Asked if there would be more provisions made on its O&G accounts this year, Khairussaleh said the bank believed that its O&G portfolio was “under control”, at 2.8% of its total loan book. “But again, potentially there could be (situations), on a case to case basis, where customers may go through some difficulty and that’s where we should help. If you believe that their business can sustain over the long-term, it is our duty to help them.”He added that there were no systematic issues for now.On its investment banking business, he said the bank was “doing well” in Malaysia.“We do expect a few IPOs this year,” adding that RHB had the mandates for “two or three reasonably big ones.”Overseas business remains challenging, Khairussaleh said, as the bank does not have as big a scale as it does in Malaysia.“That’ s why we focus on our niche.“In Singapore for example, we will do equities but we will not do the debt market business because we do not have the capability for distribution there.“For our overseas business, we take a pragmatic approach focusing on our niche but in Malaysia, we  can pretty much do everything.”RHB announced a record profit of RM2.305bil for its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018.At last look, its shares were up 4 sen to RM5.79."

Customers are also given the flexibility to purchase the property any time after 12 months of renting at a locked-in price.However, the HouzKEY scheme was only available for completed units, and not new launches.Maybank Real Estate Ventures managing director Sally Lye said the FlexKey collaboration with SP Setia allows the bank to widen its reach and enable more Malaysians to own properties without having to worry about the high upfront costs associated with purchasing a property.The Setia FlexKey scheme is available for more than 20 residential projects by S P Setia in the Klang Valley, Johor and Penang, from now until Dec 31, 2019. Considering the array of benefits offered by this scheme, SP Setia anticipates an increase of home purchases in the coming months as more homebuyers are informed of this initiative.FlexKey is applicable for the group’s mid-range residential units, which are priced from RM292,000 to RM800,000."
